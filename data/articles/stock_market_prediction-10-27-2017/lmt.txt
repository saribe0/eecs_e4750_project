The earnings cycle is sending some mixed signals for the first time this quarter as three more widely watched stocks provided just “OK” earnings results for the quarter. With the major indices trading at their all-time highs, “OK” results are usually likely to cause traders to start hitting the “sell” button, as we’re seeing on a few stocks today.Today’s three big stock charts analyze the price patterns of Biogen Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) and McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) as two out of three of these companies are trading lower in the wake of their earnings results creating potential buying opportunities.Biogen shares traded strongly right into their earnings report, suggesting that the company needed to nail their earnings report to avoid a “sell the news” situation that would take BIIB stock back into its trading range. The report didn’t blow investor’s hair back, so let’s see what the chart says now:Defense stocks have been among the groups of stocks posting strong, low volatility rallies, you know, the kind everyone likes. The problem happens when a company like that misses earnings, the way that Lockheed Martin did. This quarter’s results missed expectations, although management did guide forward earnings higher, which is the saving grace right now.So, is LMT stock a buy on this dip?Next PageArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2017/10/3-big-stock-charts-for-tuesday-biogen-inc-biib-lockheed-martin-corporation-lmt-and-mcdonalds-corporation-mcd/.©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC

RIGA, Oct. 26 (Xinhua) -- Latvijas Mobilais Telefons (LMT) mobile telecommunications operator and MikroTik computer networking equipment maker are joining forces to bring the 5G technology to Latvia, representatives of the mobile operator said.A radio link with a 5G-compatible base station, which has been created for wireless data transmission between the two companies' offices, can send data at the speed of 10 Gb/s. The radio link is ten times faster than the maximum speed of data traffic possible in the wireless networks of the previous generation.LMT has provided the connection so that MikroTik can use it to develop equipment compatible with the next generation, or 5G technology.In the coming years, such connections will be necessary to use the Internet of Things (IoT) in the mobile 5G network.Already at the beginning of this year, LMT launched cooperation on the 5G technology with Riga Technical University (RTU) and Nokia telecommunications infrastructure provider. This cooperation has resulted in the installation of the first 5G base stations in Latvia.LMT, which is the oldest mobile operator in Latvia, posted 22.3 million euros (26.3 million U.S. dollars) in net profit on a turnover of 190 million euros for 2016.MikroTik closed 2016 with 66.2 million euros profit and 223.3 million euros in turnover.

Latvian mobile operator LMT has deployed a platform from Broadpeak to support its new live, on-demand and catch-up TV services. Hannu Pro provided expertise in systems integration to streamline the launch of the new services. Broadpeak's multiscreen solution includes CDN and video systems.
Broadpeak's BkS350 origin packager and BkS400 cache servers deliver video content via adaptive bit rate technology. Using the servers, LMT can package encoded content, on the fly, in multiple adaptive bitrate formats (e.g., Apple HLS, Microsoft Smooth Streaming, Adobe HDS, and Mpeg-Dash) to address the wide range of players and devices on the market. The presence of a local cache removes any contention point that could impact the traffic between the origin server and the edge network, improving QoS and QoE by streaming higher video profiles more frequently.
Utilizing Broadpeak's BkM100 Video Delivery Mediator, LMT can manage security, load balancing, and failover tasks.

     The Q3 earnings season is in full swing, with 38.2% of the S&P 500 members having reported their numbers as of Oct 25. So far, earnings growth rate for these 164 index members have been lower than the preceding quarter, whereas revenue growth rate shows acceleration. As far as the broader Aerospace sector  is concerned, although earnings growth projections are not very inspiring, 83.3% of the stocks that have reported results delivered a beat as of Oct 25.

Over the last five trading sessions, major indices of the Aerospace-Defense industry hint at conflicting results, probably on mixed earnings expectations from major defense biggies that are lined up for their quarterly release this week.

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) gained 1.05% in yesterday’s session, going up from its prior closing price of $193.66 to $195.69. The price has been moving in both directions for this period, and there has been a 2.44% gain over 10-day period. Trading activity decreased by -12.69 million shares, and in total, 7.97 M shares exchanged hands for about $1 560.17 million. It should be noted that increasing price and decreasing volume show lack of interest and this is a warning that something has fundamentally changed.Inside NVDA’s Recent TrendNVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) lies in the middle of a wide and strong rising trend in the short term and issued considerable signs about additional rally. Short-term traders are predicted to see a rally of 21.57% over the course of a quarter and, with 90% chance the price will be floating in the range of $222.45 and $248.85 in this timeframe.NVIDIA Corporation Technical Signals
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
NVDA has witnessed its short term MA triggering a sell signal. Meanwhile, however, the long-term average has generated a buy signal. When the short-run moving average rises above its longer-term trend, a buy signal is created. This is because a short-run moving average that crosses its long-run moving average counterpart is seen as the initiation of an upward trend. On additional rally, the share price will meet short term resistance at around $196.70. On a drop, the stock is likely to find some support over the long run, which begins at $184.01. A buy signal will be generated if it crosses above the short term moving average. Meanwhile, however, a price crossing below the long term moving average will generate a sell signal. Its pivot point low generated buy signal on Wednesday October 25, 2017, which calls for additional surge until the stock forms a new pivot point high. There was a decrease in volume but the price rose. This is usually not interpreted as a good sign as traders widely believe falling volume should see declining stock. Investors should be watching the price action like a hawk in the coming sessions.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Support And Resistance LevelsNVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) recorded volume accumulation so there will probably be a surplus of buyers at $187.55. In case of gains, the next resistance from accumulated volume will not be far away from today’s level at $197.58, $197.80 and $197.93.
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
Accumulated volume is going to prevent the price from rising further at $197.58 and this action will lead the price to take a temporary pause or stay muted for a few days.NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Risk AssessmentA volatility based measure Bollinger Bands suggests this stock poses high risk. In the most recent session, the stock price hovered around $2.35 between high and low, or 1.21%. The average volatility for the past week stood at 1.99%.

On Wednesday, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) fell 13.5% despite beating earnings and revenue expectations. The company said revenue will decline sequentially by 12% to 18%. However, management boosted its full-year sales estimates. Still, shares were hammered. Could the same thing happen to NVDA stock when Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) reports fiscal third-quarter 2018 earnings on Nov. 11?Plenty of investors have been looking at NVDA stock price today for clues as to what it might do. On Wednesday, it fell 2.5% in sympathy to AMD after previously nearing its 52-week high just under $200 a share. The big question is, what will it do leading to up and after NVDA earnings?The NVDA news has been good. Business demand remains robust. It’s well positioned in every meaningful tech growth market, including self-driving cars, artificial intelligence (AI), data-centers, cloud-computing, and graphic cards used in gaming and cryptocurrencies.All of that growth has put an immense valuation on Nvidia, with NVDA stock trading at 48 times forward earnings estimates. It may be forecast to grow 41% this year, but that growth slows to just 10.7% next year (fiscal 2019). Perhaps this forecast is too low. Even if we were to double it to 21%, I would still fold on a stock trading at 48 times earnings.Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB), Alibaba Holding Group Ltd (NYSE:BABA) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) actually have better growth rates and trade at roughly half the premium. So why pay up so much for NVDA, which notably, also trades at 14x sales?We all know self-driving cars, AI, and cloud storage will be highly relevant in the years to come. We don’t know who will win those wars — be it the battle between Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) and General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), or the cloud war between Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).However, we know that no matter which company or companies win, the one constant helping to power it all will be Nvidia. That’s why investors feel comfortable bidding up the stock to unimaginable heights. That’s why shares are up more than 80% in 2017, 170% in the past 12 months and 580% over the past two years.Does NVDA stock price today justify its future realities? It does, but it also limits how much upside could be left. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) has a market cap of $190 billion. NVDA stock is up to a $116 billion valuation. But despite having 61% of the market cap as INTC, NVDA’s sales are just one-seventh (~14.4%) the size. I definitely like Nvidia. Many have made the case it can go to $250. Longer term, I definitely don’t disagree. We know Nvidia is and will remain a powerhouse, but finding the right risk/reward balance is key.Next Page Article printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2017/10/can-we-expect-nvidia-corporation-stock-to-plunge-after-earnings-like-amd/.©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC

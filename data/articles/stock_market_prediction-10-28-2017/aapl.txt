Tech giant Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has seen its shares languish around the $155 mark for the past three months. Investors are questioning whether the company’s latest devices, the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, will be enough to keep the firm’s revenue on the upswing after a brief period of decline. The new iPhones have had a lukewarm reception, as many complain that they are too similar to the 7 models, and others hold out for the iPhone X due out in November.Apple stock’s loss of momentum provides an opportunity to buy, especially considering the fact that AAPL earnings are due out next week. While some are cautious ahead of the fourth quarter results, I think the results will send the stock higher, making now a great entry point.As I mentioned, Apple’s revenue is of utmost importance to investors, especially after the firm reported a revenue decline for the first time ever last year. Since then, Apple has been able to report revenue growth consistently, and this quarter is unlikely to be any different.Apple is expecting to report fourth quarter revenue to be somewhere between $49 billion and $52 billion. That means even if the figures come in at the low end, Apple will be able to report year-over-year growth from last year’s fourth quarter revenue of $46.9 billion. However, in the past, the company’s management has been notoriously conservative when it comes to AAPL earnings guidance, so I think it’s safe to assume that the revenue figures will come in on the higher end of the scale.Some worry about whether the lackluster reception of the iPhone 8 will hurt the firm’s revenue. That’s a valid concern considering that iPhone sales are the meat and potatoes of Apple’s overall revenue. It’s true that people appear to be holding out for the iPhone X, the sales of which won’t impact the fourth quarter results. But I’d imagine that management took this into account when they were making their forecasts.Another big catalyst for AAPL stock is the firm’s ability to continue growing from quarter to quarter. Next week’s AAPL earnings call will likely be dominated by questions about the company’s highly anticipated iPhone X and the projections for its holiday sales. With so many souped-up new features and very few rivals boasting similar capabilities, the iPhone X has a lot of potential to boost Apple’s sales during the holiday shopping season.As HSBC analyst Steven Pelayo pointed out when the bank gave AAPL stock a “Buy” rating, Apple has a lot of loyal customers who are likely waiting for the iPhone X to hit the shelves before they upgrade. That massively loyal customer base gives Apple a wide moat. The buzz around the iPhone X has made it a must-have for people who are dedicated to the Apple ecosystem.Next PageArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2017/10/apple-inc-aapl-stock-3-reasons/.©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC

At this point, there’s nothing under-the-radar about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) or its bevy of popular devices. Every investor is watching to see how the iPhone X will be received, and Apple’s 35 percent year-to-date surge is a sign that most people are confident it will be yet another success in Cupertino.But while Apple is one of the most widely owned stocks in the market, many of its international suppliers are virtually unknown to American investors.HSBC recently initiated coverage of Apple stock with a Buy rating, and analyst Steven Pelayo included the firm’s top seven international Apple supplier stock picks in the note as well.“Our interest in Apple’s supply chain is not only for insights into Apple, but also to identify related investable opportunities,” he said.

It’s a great day, and year, to own stock in America’s technology sector.Mostly, the reasons were clear: Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet reported expectation-beating earnings yesterday (Oct. 26) after trading hours, and Apple saw strong demand for its new iPhone X overnight. As for Facebook, apparently a rising tide lifts all boats. By 1:30pm ET today, the market capitalization of those companies increased by $181 billion. For the sake of comparison, Goldman Sachs has a market cap of $93 billion.This year so far has been a big one for these companies, which have added nearly $1 trillion in value. And it’s only October—at current rates, these companies will have accrued that $1 trillion in market capitalization by the end of the year. Who knows, it could even happen next week when Facebook and Apple report earnings.

http://www.valuewalk.com/2017/10/apple-inc-stock-pops-after-iphone-x-sells-out-in-minutes/

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock surged on Friday after the company revealed that iPhone X preorders were “off the charts.” It seems like the $1,000 price tag didn’t scare anyone away, and the iPhone X was reportedly sold out in only 10 minutes. There was so much traffic on Apple’s website and on mobile carriers’ websites that many of them crashed under the weight of people who got up in the middle of the night to preorder Apple’s latest and greatest iPhone.Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White said in a note to investors that only those who preordered an iPhone X “in the opening minutes” seem to have gotten a Nov. 3 ship date. Within minutes, shipping times grew first to one to two weeks and then two to three weeks after 30 minutes had passed.He also looked into lead times for the phone in China and reported that they were at five to six weeks on Friday. He predicts that the iPhone X could finally turn the company’s trends in Greater China positive on a quarterly basis in the first half of fiscal 2018 with a return to growth in the year. Reclaiming China would likely give Apple stock a major boost as sales there have been declining since after the iPhone 6 cycle.According to MarketWatch, Cascend Securities analysts conducted their own survey of availability for the iPhone X in the 100 biggest U.S. markets. They learned that in all of them, the iPhone X was sold out on preorder online home delivery within five hours. However, they also reported that some supply was still available in stores, either for purchase online with in-store pickup on Nov. 3, which is launch day. They also said that supply was dwindling fast and expected it to be gone by noon or possibly before.Reports of short supply also spilled over onto social media where people tweeted their frustrations with the Apple Store app, Apple’s website and their mobile carriers’ websites. It seems buyers took our recommendations of keeping multiple browser tabs open when trying to place their preorders, and all the extra traffic crashed the sites.Technical glitches were widespread as some buyers even reported that they preordered within a minute of iPhone X preorders going live in the Apple Store app and still didn’t get a Nov. 3 delivery date.Apple guru and analyst-turned-venture-capitalist Gene Munster took to his traditional habits of checking out demand on the first day of a new iPhone, although these days he’s with Loup Ventures, the venture capital firm he founded.Munster’s team at Loup shared lead times for iPhone X shipping dates on Friday and found that in less than three minutes, all iPhone X models except for those running on the Sprint network had ship times of two to three weeks. By Friday afternoon, lead times were five to six weeks, and Munster wrote in a post on his firm’s website that demand for the phone “is trending more favorable than investor expectations.” Thus, the iPhone X can be credited for Friday’s rally in Apple stock.Apple stock closed up 3.56% at $163.05 on Friday as it approached the 52-week high of $164.64 but just couldn’t get over the bump. Friday was a strong day for tech stocks in general, with Microsoft’s and Intel’s earnings beats Thursday nights driving strong gains in their stocks. The gains in Intel and Microsoft stock added approximately 63 points to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, MarketWatch estimates. Unfortunately, that gain was eaten up by Chevron’s and Merck’s declines after both companies disappointed before the bell on Friday.Apple stock added another 39 points to the Dow, however, resulting in a 22-point gain for the index to close out the week.

http://www.nasdaq.com/article/apple-reports-q4-results-november-2-cm867451

Tech titan Apple ( AAPL  ) will release its fiscal fourth-quarter results after the market close on November 2. The company is expected to post earnings of $1.86 per share, up from $1.67 during the same period last year, and the stock is up 35.4% on the year.AAPL was recently trading at $157.31, down $7.63 from its 12-month high and $53.23 above its 12-month low. Technical indicators for AAPL are bullish and the stock is in a strong upward trend. The stock has recent support above $152.50 and has recent resistance below $160.90. Of the 29 analysts who cover the stock, 18 rate it a "strong buy", five rate it a "buy", four rate it a "hold", and two rate it a "strong sell". AAPL gets a score of 78 from InvestorsObserver's  Stock Score Report.Apple has been a top performer over the last year, and the stock is currently trading near a record high ahead of the upcoming quarterly report. Apple has an excellent earnings track record, posting better than expected profits in each of the last five quarters, and higher than expected sales four of the last five quarters. iPhone sales continue to drive the company's top and bottom lines, and iPhone sales will once again be the primary focus for investors. Apple has already started shipping its new iPhone 8 models, and the iPhone X pre-order date has finally arrived, but with limited supplies, iPhone X customers may not get the phones in their hands until 2018. The market will certainly pay attention to the company's overall profit and sales, but the stock action following the report will mainly be driven to how well the iPhone sales numbers are received. I expect a good quarter, and the stock to move higher following the report. The consensus calls for earnings of $1.86 per share, and the street has a whisper number of $1.93.If you want to set up a bullish hedged trade on AAPL, consider a January 130/135 bull-put credit spread for a 45-cent credit. That's a potential 9.9% return (42.5% annualized*) and the stock would have to fall 13.9% to cause a problem.If you want to take a bearish stance on the stock at this time, consider a January 180/185 bear-call credit spread for a 40-cent credit. That's a potential 8.7% return (37.3% annualized*) and the stock would have to rise 14.7% to cause a problem.

     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that AMAT may be headed in the future. To do this, analysts often study the speed and magnitude of a stock’s price movements with what are known as momentum indicators. The logic is that as a stock’s momentum slows, it may be nearing key support or resistance levels and possibly the end of a current trend. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for AMAT is 71.07%, which suggests that the stock may be primed for a trend reversal or a corrective pullback in price. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 88.62%, tells a similar story, and suggests that AMAT currently trades in overbought territory.What do the trading volumes reveal?Volume patterns are useful for gauging the level of conviction behind price changes, and can be used to make predictions about future price movements. A sudden increase in a stock’s activity can be a sign that investors are trading in anticipation of a catalyst, or that investors feel very strongly in one way or the other about the future direction of a stock. Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT) average trading volume of 10,523,640 during the past month is 6.72% above its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been more active than usual in the stock in recent times.What do the analysts think?AMAT is currently undervalued by -5.04% relative to the average 1-year price target of $58.90 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 1.80, which implies that analysts are generally bullish in their outlook for AMAT over the next year.How risky is the stock? When predicting the future performance for a stock, it’s also important to take into account risk. To do this, analysts often use a stock’s beta, which measures the stock’s volatility relative to the overall market.Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) has a beta of 1.83, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are more extreme than the market as a whole. AMAT therefore has a above average level of market risk. During the past couple of weeks, AMAT average daily volatility was 14.11%, which is 14.16 percentage points lower than the average volatility over the past 100 days.

(AMAT) lies in the upper part of a wide and strong rising trend in the short term, and this will normally pose a very good selling opportunity for the short-term trader as reaction back towards the lower part of the trend can be expected. A break-up at the top trend line at $56.82 will firstly indicate a stronger raising rate. Short-term traders are predicted to see a rally of 32.56% over the course of a quarter and, with 90% chance the price will be floating in the range of $67.23 and $75.32 in this timeframe.Applied Materials, Inc. Technical Signals
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
AMAT has witnessed its long term and short term MA triggering a buy signal. Many traders watch for short-term averages to cross above long-term averages to signal the beginning of a uptrend. Upon corrections, the price will meet support from the averages between $55.82 and $50.98. A break down through these support points will trigger sell signals. Its pivot point low generated buy signal on Wednesday October 25, 2017, which calls for additional surge until the stock forms a new pivot point high. There was a decrease in volume but the price rose. This is usually not interpreted as a good sign as traders widely believe falling volume should see declining stock. Investors should be watching the price action like a hawk in the coming sessions.Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) Support And Resistance LevelsIn case of pullback, the next support the price will capture from accumulated volume will not be far away from current price at $52.09 and $50.62. In case of gains, the next resistance from accumulated volume will not be far away from today’s level at $56.09, $56.37 and $56.38.
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
It is important to note, however, that the stock needs to make its way through natural risk while testing a key support level. Once this support is broken, another support level will be to be established at a lower level. Turning back to this stock, Applied Materials approaches the first support point just current price at $52.09. In case of a break, the next support we will see from accumulated volume is going to be at $50.62 and $44.30. Accumulated volume is going to prevent the price from rising further at $56.09 and this action will lead the price to take a temporary pause or stay muted for a few days.Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT) Risk AssessmentThe number of shares changed hands in the stock is good, indicating the interest and low risk associated with it. In the most recent session, the stock price hovered around $0.84 (1.51%) between intraday high and intraday low. Each day in the past 1 week, the average volatility remained at 1.77%.

Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) shares are up more than 73.32% this year and recently increased 1.14% or $0.63 to settle at $55.93. Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX), on the other hand, is up 95.57% year to date as of 10/26/2017. It currently trades at $206.78 and has returned 2.89% during the past week.Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) and Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) are the two most active stocks in the Semiconductor Equipment & Materials industry based on today’s trading volumes. We will compare the two companies based on the strength of various metrics, including growth, profitability, risk, return, and valuation to determine if one is a better investment than the other.GrowthThe ability to grow earnings at a compound rate over time is a crucial determinant of investment value. Analysts expect AMAT to grow earnings at a 28.63% annual rate over the next 5 years. Comparatively, LRCX is expected to grow at a 17.70% annual rate. All else equal, AMAT’s higher growth rate would imply a greater potential for capital appreciation.

Profitability and ReturnsGrowth isn’t very attractive to investors if companies are sacrificing profitability and shareholder returns to achieve that growth. We will use EBITDA margin and Return on Investment (ROI), which control for differences in capital structure between the two companies, to measure profitability and return., compared to an EBITDA margin of 28.68% for Lam Research Corporation (LRCX). AMAT’s ROI is 17.30% while LRCX has a ROI of 18.10%. The interpretation is that LRCX’s business generates a higher return on investment than AMAT’s.Cash Flow

Comparatively, LRCX’s free cash flow per share was +3.95. On a percent-of-sales basis, AMAT’s free cash flow was 10.74% while LRCX converted 7.98% of its revenues into cash flow. This means that, for a given level of sales, AMAT is able to generate more free cash flow for investors.Liquidity and Financial RiskLiquidity and leverage ratios measure a company’s ability to meet short-term obligations and longer-term debts. AMAT has a current ratio of 2.90 compared to 3.10 for LRCX. This means that LRCX can more easily cover its most immediate liabilities over the next twelve months. AMAT’s debt-to-equity ratio is 0.61 versus a D/E of 0.42 for LRCX. AMAT is therefore the more solvent of the two companies, and has lower financial risk.ValuationAMAT trades at a forward P/E of 15.30, a P/B of 6.87, and a P/S of 4.32, compared to a forward P/E of 13.80, a P/B of 4.92, and a P/S of 3.71 for LRCX. AMAT is the expensive of the two stocks on an earnings, book value and sales basis. Given that earnings are what matter most to investors, analysts tend to place a greater weight on the P/E.Analyst Price Targets and OpinionsInvestors often compare a stock’s current price to an analyst price target to get a sense of the potential upside within the next year. AMAT is currently priced at a -5.04% to its one-year price target of 58.90. Comparatively, LRCX is -8.52% relative to its price target of 226.05. This suggests that LRCX is the better investment over the next year.The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 1.80 for AMAT and 2.00 for LRCX, which implies that analysts are more bullish on the outlook for LRCX.Risk and VolatilityBeta is an important measure that gives investors a sense of the market risk associated with a particular stock. A beta above 1 signals above average market risk, while a beta below 1 implies below average volatility. AMAT has a beta of 1.83 and LRCX’s beta is 1.64. LRCX’s shares are therefore the less volatile of the two stocks.Insider Activity and Investor SentimentThe analysis of insider buying and selling trends can be extended to the aggregate level. Short interest, which represents the percentage of a stock’s tradable shares currently being shorted, captures what the market as a whole feels about a stock. AMAT has a short ratio of 1.40 compared to a short interest of 4.67 for LRCX. This implies that the market is currently less bearish on the outlook for AMAT.SummaryLam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) beats Applied Materials, Inc.

Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) reported blowout earnings 2 weeks ago. Now, BAC stock is trading at its highest level since the Great Recession.The majority of BofA’s run to decade highs has happened since Donald J. Trump won the Presidential election. Since then, BAC stock is up some 60% on the hopes of higher interest rates and less regulation.But I think this most recent leg higher is the beginning of the end of the rally for BofA stock. The harsh reality is that interest rates will remain lower for longer, thanks to automated technology threatening huge swaths of the labor market.Without higher interest rates, BofA’s net interest income won’t grow at the rate it has been growing. Without robust growth in net interest income, BofA stock will fall back.It’s only a matter of time.BofA stock now trades at more than 1.1-times book value.At a 10% premium-to-book value, BAC stock is trading at its richest valuation since before the Great Recession. Clearly, BofA stock is priced with optimistic top- and bottom-line growth expectations. Those optimistic top- and bottom-line growth expectations are fueled primarily by expectations for robust growth in net interest income.For example, take last quarter: Total revenues were up $806 million. The breakdown was a $922 million increase in net interest income and a $116 million decrease in non-interest income.Thus, it’s clear to see that in order for BofA to successfully grow its top and bottom lines, the bank needs net interest income to continue to trend up. In order for that to happen, rates need to go up. Granted, loan and deposit growth will help some, but the big driver here is higher rates. Management said on the third-quarter conference call that a 100 basis-point increase in interest rates would boost net interest income by $3.2 billion over the next 12 months.All in, then, BAC stock is a narrative based almost entirely on higher interest rates fueling robust profit growth.But that narrative breaks down once you understand that rates aren’t going up big any time soon.Article printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2017/10/bank-of-america-bac-stock-beginning-end/.©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC

It is widely believed that a stock’s future performance can best be predicted by analyzing prior trends and patterns in price. In the case of BAC, the chart has some interesting things to say about where the stock might be headed in the future.How has the stock performed recently?Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) in the last month has increased +9.00%. Shares are now up over the past year, outperforming the broad market by -100% and outperformed a peer group of similar companies by 114%.

Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that BAC may be headed in the future. If we want to get a sense of BAC’s future performance, we have to look at the speed and size of these price movements. Using what are known as momentum indicators, we can use the stock’s price momentum to get a sense of whether the stock is in the midst of, or nearing the end of, a current trend. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for BAC is 72.39%, which suggests that the stock may be primed for a trend reversal or a corrective pullback in price. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 91.79%, tells a similar story, and suggests that BAC currently trades in overbought territory.What do the trading volumes reveal?Volume patterns can also be useful for predicting future performance. When trading activity is abnormally high, it’s often a sign that the market feels particularly strong in one way or another about the future direction of a stock. Bank of America Corporation (BAC) average trading volume of 64,292,512 during the past month is 20.6% below its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been less active than usual in the stock in recent times.What do the analysts think?BAC is currently undervalued by -1.11% relative to the average 1-year price target of $28.05 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts.

Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) continues to slowly improve. With the financial crisis of 2007-09 long behind it, the Charlotte-based company saw buyer interest in BofA stock after the presidential election. The hopes of higher interest rates and a lighter regulatory burden likely drove BAC stock higher. Despite the recent stock rally, the bank can be described in one word—average. Given the lack of major news and its solid but mediocre financials, BAC stock has become a hold.Few assert Bank of America stock is suitable for anyone besides conservative investors. In an industry such as banking, no news is good news. Because banks hold money, so much of their business depends on reputation. Hence, it pays to be boring and to avoid scandals such as the one that affected Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE:WFC) last year. In contrast, BofA stock has risen over 60% in the last 12 months.Despite the increase, post-election hopes have only partially materialized. Short-term interest rates have steadily gone up. However, long-term interest rates have changed little over the last year. On the regulatory front, many rules have been rescinded. Still, no major legislation such as a repeal or a reform of Dodd-Frank has yet occurred.Other than the recent stock price increases, the lack of BAC news is the best thing to happen to the stock. For BofA stock, the price to earnings (PE) ratio stands at about 15, the price to book (PB) ratio rose above one this year, and now the stock trades at above 1.1 times earnings.Metrics at this level would have investors buying Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) or even an older company such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) with every available dime. Unfortunately for investors of BAC stock, they own shares in a bank. With the recent increase in the BAC stock price, metrics such as PE or PB ratios are near industry averages. Even when compared with its main competitors Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), the stock also appears average.The BAC dividend continues to follow the road to recovery after nearly being eliminated by the fallout of last decade’s financial crisis. BofA stock once paid a dividend of $2.24 per share. That dividend fell to 4 cents per share and remained at that level for several years.Next PageArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2017/10/bank-of-america-corp-bac-stock-not-inspiring/.©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC

	GOP mega-donor Rebekah Mercer emailed the CEO of a data science firm working on Donald Trump’s presidential campaign to ask if the hacked Clinton-related emails published by WikiLeaks could be indexed in a searchable database, it has been reported.
	Mercer, a highly influential political donor who along with her family has contributed tens of millions of dollars to conservative causes, reportedly emailed Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix in August 2016, according to the Wall Street Journal.
	Mercer, who initially supported Sen. Ted Cruz’s presidential bid, later endorsed Trump and introduced both Steve Bannon and Kellyanne Conway as key figures in his campaign.
	She received a suggestion from someone she met at an event for Cruz that the WikiLeaks emails should be indexed or otherwise organized to make them more searchable, a source to the WSJ.
	Mercer forwarded the suggestion to Nix, who responded saying he had reached out to Julian Assange in June 2016 before the emails were released to ask if he might share the documents with Cambridge Analytica. Assange had turned him down, Nix said.
	WikiLeaks, which obtained emails from both the hacked accounts of Clinton campaign manager John Podesta and the Democratic National Committee, started releasing the documents in July 2016.
	Just one week later, Cambridge Analytica, which is financially backed by Mercer’s father Robert Mercer, received its first payment from the Trump campaign for its “data management services."
	U.S. intelligence agencies later concluded Russians hacked the accounts and turned the emails over to WikiLeaks, although Assange has adamantly denied the source.
	Trump's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner and digital director Brad Parscale hired the big data company known for political marketing and micotargeting.
	The House Intelligence Committee has requested information from Cambridge Analytica as part of its investigation into Russia's involvement in the elections.
	Members of the committee have also questioned whether the company may have helped Russians target American voters on social media during the presidential campaign.

Rebekah Mercer, a top Trump donor, contacted the CEO of the data analytics firm the Trump campaign hired and asked if the company could better organize the emails related to Hillary Clinton that were being released by WikiLeaks, a report said Friday.Mercer forwarded Alexander Nix, CEO of Cambridge Analytica, an email in August 2016 from a person she had met at an event supporting Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, that the Trump campaign should help organize the hacked emails concerning Clinton to make them more searchable, according to the Wall Street Journal.She then asked whether this was possible for Cambridge Analytica or the Government Accountability Institute, a conservative nonprofit dedicated to investigative research.Nix reportedly responded that he had already contacted WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, in June and asked him to share the emails with the company so they could help disperse them, but said Assange had denied his request.Assange appeared to confirm Wednesday that Nix offered to provide him assistance with the 33,000 emails he claimed to have recovered from Clinton's unauthorized server from her time serving as secretary of state."I can confirm an approach by Cambridge Analytica [prior to November last year] and can confirm that it was rejected by WikiLeaks," Assange tweeted Wednesday.Mercer and Nix also corresponded with Peter Schweizer, co-founder of the Government Accountability Institute, and Schweizer shared that he was developing a searchable database of the Clinton-related emails. However, the database was never unveiled, according to the Wall Street Journal.Special counsel Robert Mueller, along with House and Senate intelligence committees, are investigating whether the Trump administration colluded with Russia during the 2016 election.The House Intelligence Committee requested Cambridge Analytica to provide information about their involvement in the Trump campaign in relation to the panel's Russia probe.

Back in 2015, privacy campaigners became aware of a new Wi-Fi-connected toy that raised considerable concern. At issue was Hello Barbie, a doll with speech recognition technology that could hold a two-way conversation with a child.Parents and others grew concerned when it became clear that childrenâs conversations would be stored on cloud servers and used in various ways by Mattel, the toy maker. At the time, Forbes reported that the toyâs terms and conditions allowed the sharing of âaudio recordings with third party vendors who assist us with speech recognition.âThis system had the potential to reveal and share a childâs innermost thoughts. And it raised a wide range of ethical questions. For example, what is the appropriate response if a child asks âWhat should I be when I grow up?âThe episode is emblematic of a much bigger question: How should childrenâs interests be represented in the debate about privacy and big data?Today, Gabrielle Berman and Kerry Albright from the UNICEF Office of Research in Florence, Italy, argue that childrenâs rights have been underrepresented in this area. âDue to the potential for severe, long-lasting and differential impacts on children, child rights need to be firmly integrated onto the agendas of global debates about ethics and data science,â they say.Privacy issues are always complex, but they have greater relevance for children than ever before. Data is being collected and processed on a previously unimaginable scale that is growing at a fantastic rate. âThis accumulation implies that more data will be collected on children over their lifetime than ever before,â say Berman and Albright.Clearly, there will be benefits. Health experts hope to use this data to personalize and improve medicine, for example. Others hope to deliver better services tailored more precisely to each personâs needs. The next generation has the most to gain from these benefitsBut there are disadvantages, too. One problem is the persistence of dataâthe information gathered about children and teenagers could be tied to them by third parties throughout their lives.This is being addressed by the âright to be forgotten,â which allows people in Europe to have historical information about them deleted in certain circumstances. Indeed, there are special provisions within European legislation about how this applies to information about children.Another concern is the spread of data beyond the parties who have collected it. Though anonymization techniques often prevent the data from being linked to specific individuals, there are various ways in which data can later be de-anonymized.Then there are the unknown consequences of future data processing techniques. Nobody is sure how the data that is gathered today will be used in the future.For example, social services in countries such as New Zealand and the U.S. already use data gathered about families to identify children who are at risk. Certain educational establishments use data gathered about students to predict how well they will do and to make decisions about their future.It is not at all clear that these applications were apparent when the data was gathered. An important question is whether the actions taken as a result of this data processing are themselves creating undesired outcomes.Finally, there is the issue of informed consent. In Europe, parents of children under 13 must give consent in order for data to be collected. But there is less protection for older children. An important issue is how to present children with the information they need to decide whether to accept terms and conditions, and how this should change as they get older. This is particularly tricky when future uses of the data are unknown.Berman and Albright say there needs to be a significant effort to better represent the interests of children in this debate, particularly when children in some parts of the world are significantly less well protected than others. âIn an era of increasing dependence on data science and big data, the voices of one set of major stakeholdersâthe worldâs children and those who advocate on their behalfâhave been largely absent,â they say.Thatâs troubling, and a good reason to refocus efforts now. As Berman and Albright conclude: âThere is no better time to encourage greater debate and dialogue between the child rights and data science communities for the betterment of the lives of children worldwide, than now.âRef: arxiv.org/abs/1710.06881 : Children and the Data Cycle: Rights and Ethics in a Big Data WorldGet stories like this before anyone else with First Look.Emerging Technology from the arXiv Emerging Technology from the arXiv covers the latest ideas and technologies that appear on the Physics arXiv preprint server.

Austin Police Department officials this week have been exploring the latest big idea in policing: big data – and mulling how they might use it to go beyond crime stats and targeted enforcement efforts.Interim Chief Brian Manley and others are participating in panel discussions in the first Big Data and Community Policing Conference, organized by community policing nonprofit MEASURE.The conference brought together law enforcement professionals, activists, tech developers, students, analysts and others to hash out efforts and ideas to improve the relationship between police and citizens through data.Manley has long touted APD’s “data-driven” policies that try to target and prevent crime as it evolves across the city.He pointed to the Restore Rundberg project as a successful example of how APD used data and tech to attack a problem and change conditions on the ground in Austin.“Through using tech we had and all the data we had, we identified a small segment of Austin that reported a large preparation of crime,” he said. “Through effective use of data, we (won) a federal grant that allowed us to really make a big difference in there.”The $1 million grant from the U.S. Department of Justice allowed police to launch the program in 2014 and keep resources focused in the area through September 2016.
Previous reporting from the American-Statesman showed that crime fell by 4.5 percent in the overall Rundberg area, and much more sharply in specific hot spots.Now, Manley says the department wants to use the data it collects to address issues outside of the traditional crime-tracking and statistics, and focus more on identifying gaps in service areas and how the community views police. Such information could help officers come up with creative solutions to increase transparency and accountability.“I think we’re always open to explaining data we have an how we use it,” Manley said. “We believe in being as transparent as the law allows us to be,” Manley said. “Although we are keepers of the data, it really is the public’s data.”Events speakers include Austin Mayor Steve Adler, Nelson Linder of the NAACP, Rebecca Neusteter of the Vera Institute of Justice and Glen Brooks of the Chicago Police Department.The event began on Thursday, and will continue on Saturday from 10:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. at the George Carver Museum & Cultural Center at 1165 Angelina St.For more information, check out the conference website here.

              Data Sheet–Friday, October 27, 2017
            There have been times in years past that Amazon, Alphabet (read: Google), and Microsoft have had rough patches. Amazon has suffered quarters-long profit droughts. Alphabet has given its investors agita over profligate spending on non-core products. Microsoft’s growth—if not its profit engine—stalled for years, causing its stock to idle too.The middle months of 2017 have not been one of those times for any of these companies.Each, for their own reasons, reported anywhere from solid to spectacular earnings results Thursday. Amazon didn’t make any more money than it did the year before, but its growth resembles a startup more than the grownup it is. Alphabet’s ad machine is humming. Microsoft, a cloud computing convert, has completed the most impressive tech turnaround since Lou Gerstner taught an elephant to dance.That these giants are charging simultaneously—throw in Twitter and Intel too—is no coincidence. Their success is the digital transformation explained. Where the action once was in high-trafficked shopping malls, print and TV advertising, and client-server software, businesses that deliver digitally rule the roost today.Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.This is the point in any account of Big Tech’s success where journalists insert the “to be sure” paragraph, as in, to be sure, this garish performance will draw the attention of regulators, legislators, and other haters that could ruin the fun. The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal both turned in laudable examples of the art form.Those concerns only matter, of course, when they matter. For now, they don’t. It is party time. And what a party it is.***The cinema business is thinking about experimenting with dynamic pricing, as Bloomberg reported this week. Dynamic pricing—charging more when goods and services are in high demand and short supply and less when the opposite is true—isn’t new. Gasoline retailers, hoteliers, and airlines have been deploying the technique for years. Uber did it too—to great success but also with dollops of controversy largely attributed to its own stubbornness and insensitivity.According to Bloomberg, Regal Cinemas will charge more for hits and less for flops, an intriguing concept given that the real money is in egregiously overpriced popcorn and soda, not movies.Long live capitalism. And see you at the movies.Big capital gains. As Adam noted, it was one of the busiest days ever for people who follow big tech company earnings.If you want a few more interesting tidbits below the headlines, Microsoft said its annual run rate for its Azure cloud unit exceeded $20 billion for the first time. Google said pre-orders for its new Pixel 2 phones were double the number from last year and that YouTube watching on old-fashioned TV sets jumped 70% to 100 million hours a day. CFO Ruth Porat also disclosed massive cuts in spending on Google Fiber. With the Whole Foods chain now in hand, Amazon broke out sales in physical locations for the first time: $1.3 billion, or 5% of total sales. Intel surprised everyone with flat revenue in its PC chips unit. Stocks of all four companies rose in premarket trading on Friday. Microsoft was up 6%, Google parent Alphabet 4%, Amazon 8%, and Intel 3%.Pre-panic mode. Fresh off its attack on the grocery business, Amazon appears closer than ever to shaking up the prescription drug market next. The e-commerce giant has obtained wholesale pharmacy licenses in at least 12 states, including Louisiana, New Jersey, and Michigan, the St Louis Post-Dispatch reported on the basis of public records searches. The fallout is already here, as CVS’s bid for Aetna is said to be motivated in part by the looming specter of Amazon’s entry.Munch all you want, we’ll make more. With pre-orders for the iPhone X starting at midnight Pacific Time on Friday, Apple quickly ran out of phones for immediate delivery on November 3. Delays were out to six weeks on Friday morning, though according to some reports, wireless carrier Sprint still had units available for next week for Sprint customers.Horse, meet barn door. After Russia used social networks to meddle in the 2016 election, Twitter said it would ban advertisements from any accounts owned by Russian news outlets Russia Today and Sputnik. The bans are part of Twitter’s “ongoing commitment to help protect the integrity of the user experience,” the company said.Wrist slap. HR services startup Zenefits and co-founder Parker Conrad will pay almost $1 million, but won’t have to make an admission of guilt to settle charges they misled investors. Federal regulators said the company’s failure to disclose it was not in compliance with state insurance laws constituted “false and misleading statements and omissions.”Momentum play. The tech IPO train is still steaming forward. Cloud security startup Zscaler has made a confidential filing to go public, TechCrunch reported. The leak comes just as cybersecurity firm ForeScout Technologies priced its IPO at $22. It starts trading on Friday under the symbol “FSCT.”Conspiracy theories. The National Archives released almost 3,000 documents connected to the assassination of President Kennedy and put them all online. Spoiler alert: the Russians were just as surprised as everyone else by Lee Harvey Oswald’s shooting of the president.Saudi Arabia Is About to Invest $1 Billion in Branson’s Virgin Galactic By Keshia HannamAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos May Be the World’s Richest Man — Again By Lucinda ShenRussia’s RT Publishes Twitter’s $1.5 Million Pitch for 2016 Election Coverage Boost By David MeyerFacebook Just Upgraded Its Slack Competitor Chat App By Jonathan VanianWhy AMD’s New Laptop Chip Might Be Its Best Performer Yet By Aaron PressmanSuper Mario Odyssey Leads a Rush of Big Video Games This Week By Chris MorrisWe are, unfortunately, beset by news of the continuing problems of discrimination, bias, and harassment in the workplace. One related problem feeding the culture of abuse is the lack of diversity, particularly in leadership roles, at many companies. Consultants Jack Zenger and Joseph Folkman have studied the problem and put a lot of the blame at the top: leaders who aren’t good self-critics of their own biases.In fact, their surveys found that leaders who were found to be lowest rated at valuing diversity were more likely to think they were doing a great job at inclusiveness:The implications of this data are: leaders are not good judges of their own effectiveness on valuing diversity; and those leaders who are poorest fail to see the problem, while those who are the best don’t realize their skill and capability. This phenomenon is not limited to inclusiveness — the Dunning-Kruger effect, for example, explains that unskilled people are particularly prone to thinking they are more skilled than they are. Conversely, our research has found that many of the most skilled leaders are too humble and modest in assessing their strengths. Nonetheless, we find this result particularly disturbing when we see it in the context of inclusivity. While a person’s effectiveness with any skill always needs to be based on the evaluations of others, rather than self-perception, it seems especially true in this case. Inclusivity is particularly in the eye of the beholder. You might intend to be inclusive, and even think you are inclusive, but your impact on others might be very different.A few interesting longer reads I came across that are suitable for your weekend reading pleasure.Love in the Time of Robots In a secluded room at IRL, a collection of androids is stored and maintained: his hardest workers. Arranged in this space today, with its blackout curtains, thin corporate carpeting, and shelves cluttered with cables and monitors and an array of wigs, is a pair of his replicas of grown women. They are models of the Geminoid F series. The name is a play off geminus (Latin for “twin”), a reminder that their human counterparts exist somewhere in the world.Three MacBook Mistakes: Will Apple Correct Course? Apple’s not a company that backtracks easily. It’s got a lot of pride and a reputation for moving forward. And yet every so often the company makes a decision that it thinks is right and is ultimately proven to be completely wrong. In 2008, Apple removed FireWire from the MacBook, only to put it back in 2009. In 2009 the iPod Shuffle went buttonless, only to revert to its previous buttony design in 2010. The third-generation iPod, with its row of touch-sensitive controls, was a similar design cul-de-sac. And the most recent example is the Mac Pro, which Apple introduced to fanfare, but ultimately admitted was a mistake.The Scientists Persuading Terrorists to Spill Their Secrets The interviewer wanted him to provide an account of his plan, and to reveal with whom, if anyone, he has been conspiring. But the detainee – we will call him Diola – refused to divulge any information. Instead, he expounded grandiloquently on the evils of the British state for 42 minutes, with little interruption. When the interviewer attempted questions, Diola responded with scornful, finger-jabbing accusations of ignorance, naivety and moral weakness: “You don’t know how corrupt your own government is – and if you don’t care, then a curse upon you.”When the Revolution Came for Amy Cuddy Cuddy became famous in her field for a 2010 study about the effects of “power poses.” The study found that subjects who were directed to stand or sit in certain positions — legs astride, or feet up on a desk — reported stronger “feelings of power” after posing than they did before. Even more compelling than that, to many of her peers, was that the research measured actual physiological change as a result of the poses: The subjects’ testosterone levels went up, and their cortisol levels, which are associated with stress, went down.They’re saying it looks like a Pokemon monster, but Sinosauropteryx was a real dinosaur with feathers and the “bandit mask” shading of a raccoon or badger, researchers studying its 120-million-year-old fossils say.

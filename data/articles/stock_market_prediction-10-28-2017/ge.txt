General Electric (GE) is having a tough time reassuring Wall Street that its turnaround strategy will be successful. The company received a pair of downgrades earlier this week, prompting the stock to close at its lowest level in four and a half years—and shares haven’t recovered since. The stock’s losses were further exacerbated following reports that the company is looking to spinoff parts of its business.  The two downgrades were issued by UBS and Morgan Stanley. UBS lowered its rating on the stock to neutral from buy with a price target of $24 a share, while Morgan Stanley cut its rating from equalweight to underweight and lowered its price target to $22.  In a note to clients, Morgan Stanley analyst Nigel Coe wrote that the challenges CEO John Flannery faces are “greater than even we had imagined,” and the team now believes GE’s “dividend will have to be adjusted down to reflect substantially lower earnings power.” The firm recommends GE reduce its dividend from $0.96 to closer to $0.70, which would be a 37% cut.Although General Electric is by far the biggest loser in the Dow so far this year, a sell rating on GE isn’t too common, and that’s why Morgan Stanley’s bearish call caught some investors by surprise. The stock has erased more than $94 billion from its market cap in 2017 and is down about 34% since the start of the year. Now the question is if CEO John Flannery, whom Morgan Stanley interestingly called “the right man for the mission on hand” when downgrading GE, will spin off a portion of the company’s business. According to the Wall Street Journal, GE’s considering breaking off its railroad business, while Reuters reports that it’s exploring a sale of its transportation and health care information technology businesses. If GE does decide to divest one or both of these divisions, it will help the company get closer to its effort to exit more than $20 billion of assets over the next two years, a move highlighted by Flannery during GE’s earnings call October 20.General Electric was last trading down 2.2% at $20.86 on Friday.

General Electric is looking to cut costs, possibly by selling assets. GE Transportation, based in Erie for most of its 100-year-life, might be one of those assets.The story of century-old GE Transportation has included some dramatic plot twists in recent years.In the past five years alone, the company built its first North American locomotive plant outside of Erie and moved the headquarters of GE Transportation from Erie to Chicago.Now, John Flannery, the newly installed CEO of Boston-based General Electric Co., is said to be considering a move that could mark the final chapter in the history of the GE locomotive business that helped form the core of the original General Electric.The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Flannery is said to be looking "to partner, spin off or possibly sell the operations."The company, which eliminated 1,500 jobs at its Erie plant in 2015 and has plans to cut another 570 in 2018, has incentives to part with some of its assets.GE, which announced third-quarter earnings on Friday, fell far short of quarterly earnings projections, prompting the company to cut its dividends as its stock price, off more than 30 percent this year, continues to lose ground.Flannery, who is expected to offer a blueprint in November of how he plans to cut costs, is looking to divest itself of $20 billion in assets in the next two years.There was no comment from the company on Thursday."We don't comment on rumors or speculation," said Deia Campanelli, a spokeswoman for GE Transportation.Scott Slawson, president of Local 506 of the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America at GE Transportation, said he thought the story might have grown out of an idle comment from an analyst."I am not going to worry about what may or may not happen, whether we are going to merge, whether we are going to be spun off or sold," he said. "If it happens, we will deal with it then. If it doesn't happen, then yay for us."According to the Journal's report, Flannery said the company has a number of "businesses which drain investment and management resources without the prospects for a substantial reward."While that statement alone doesn't necessarily point to GE Transportation, the newspaper cites unidentified sources said to be familiar with the matter who indicate GE Transportation is being eyed for possible sale.In terms of its impact on the company's bottom line, GE Transportation is a relatively small player.GE Transportation returned a profit of $276 million in the third quarter, just a fraction of the $1.6 billion earned by GE Aviation or a little less than a third of the earnings generated by GE Healthcare.On the other hand, despite a dramatic sales slowdown over the past two years, GE Transportation's profit margin for the third quarter was 25.7 percent, the highest of any GE business.Barbara Chaffee, who has followed GE Transportation closely during the past six years as CEO of the Erie Regional Chamber and Growth Partnership, isn't ready to dismiss reports of a possible sale or merger."Flannery said he was going to cut $2 billion (in spending) and I think he's taking that seriously," she said.But her reaction to the potential change is hardly matter-of-fact."When Erie and GE locomotive have such a deep history, it kind of shakes you to the core," she said. "We know we are seeing great shifts, but it's hard to reconcile."Chaffee, who will step down from her position at THE chamber next week, said the potential of a GE sale is a reminder of the need to develop homegrown companies that are rooted in the community.Like Slawson, she hopes GE Transportation holds onto the locomotive business founded by Thomas Edison.But Chaffee is keenly aware that there's little room for nostalgia in the corporate world, especially at a company trying hard to find solid footing."For a large corporation, the reality is that their first priority has to be their shareholders," Chaffee said. "I certainly understand that they don't have the kind of relationship with the community that we have with them."Jim Martin can be reached at 870-1668 or by email.

“This is one of the first large extensions of a cloud-architected analytics platform in the utility industry.”GE inks an important deal for its grid analytics software.
	GE’s companywide earnings fell short of expectations last week, but its digital grid business keeps on growing.
	Descended from Thomas Edison’s electrical appliance enterprise, GE still has its fingers in a nearly unfathomable number of pies. It continues to lead in conventional power applications, like wind turbines and gas generators, but it’s also been building out Predix, an industrial internet-of-things business that pairs on-the-ground sensors with local and cloud computing.
	In Q3 2017, GE Digital orders grew 50 percent year over year, the company said. In previous quarters, power was the fastest-growing segment within the digital category.
	That momentum continued this week thanks to a new partnership with Exelon, one of the biggest power providers in the U.S. and a flagship customer for GE Digital. In a separate deal, the New York Power Authority will expand its use of GE software and analytics as well.
	Exelon had already adopted Predix across its fleet of competitive generators, which includes the largest nuclear capacity in the U.S. Now, the company is rolling out the industrial internet service to its portfolio of six regulated wires utilities, it announced at GE’s Minds and Machines conference Wednesday.
	The goal is to work with GE to improve the cost-effectiveness of electrical distribution and prepare for regulatory grid overhauls coming to Exelon’s various markets.
	"What we want to do is use the analytics to allow us to be prepared to pivot and support any of the models that may come up," said Brian Hurst, VP and chief analytics officer for Exelon Utilities.
	The expansion marks an evolution from the initial Predix application of monitoring the health of discrete generating assets, said Ben Kellison, director of grid research at GTM Research. 
	"This is one of the first large extensions of a cloud-architected analytics platform in the utility industry, and it’s a strong endorsement from one of the largest companies in the space that there’s value to be had from investing in digitization that crosses functional and business-unit boundaries, in this case generation, transmission and distribution."
	A smarter way to keep the lights on

Industrial companies not named General Electric Co. are actually doing pretty OK these days. But with many trading at or near records, a lot of the good news is already baked in.  It&apos;s about halfway through earnings season for manufacturers, and most reports so far have earned a positive reception from investors. That&apos;s for good reason: Broadly speaking, these firms are relying more on revenue growth, rather than cost-cuts or financial engineering, to meet their earnings guidance. Many are even raising those outlooks, in sharp contrast to GE&apos;s painful cut.RBC analyst Deane Dray calculates that companies in his coverage area have reported an average of 4 percent organic sales growth thus far for the third quarter. That compares with a decline of 2.7 percent for the year-earlier period. Post-it note maker 3M Co. in particular stands out with a 6.6 percent increase in sales excluding the impact of currency swings and M&A -- its best showing since 2011. That recovery is helping to justify the 25 percent climb in the S&P 500 Industrials Index over the past year, a return that&apos;s bested the broader benchmark. But the multiples that have resulted from that gain should make investors a bit nervous. Take 3M. Its shares are up more than 12 percent since the end of the second quarter. A big chunk of that could arguably be attributed to a swing of capital away from GE as investors realize it&apos;s perhaps not the defensive, quality company they had thought. But 3M is now valued at 28 times its trailing 12-month earnings, its highest multiple since 2003. A lot of things have to go right -- and stay right -- for that and other high valuations to make sense.And it&apos;s not like there aren&apos;t any potential fault-lines. W.W. Grainger Inc. shares climbed by more than 12 percent after the company said Oct. 17 that its profit had eroded less than feared amid online competition. A week later, Amazon.com Inc. launched Prime membership (with free shipping) for businesses, ratcheting up the pressure and bruising Grainger&apos;s stock.Back to 3M: pricing on its products was flat in the third quarter, or up 0.2 percent excluding its troubled electronics division. That made investors less worried that the company might also see an Amazon-sized whack to its margins, particularly on consumer-facing products like Post-its. But those concerns will likely continue to linger as Amazon expands its business-focused operations. Likewise, companies such as United Technologies Corp. and Ingersoll-Rand Plc weren&apos;t able to pass on sufficient enough price increases in parts of their climate-control businesses to offset rising material costs. The sky-high valuations also imply investors are looking for at least some benefit from tax reform, which still remains more of a theoretical possibility than a reality. For what it&apos;s worth, Honeywell International Inc. Chief Financial Officer Tom Szlosek told Bloomberg News the company has repatriated some $1 billion of cash this year. That&apos;s a curious thing to do if you believe that the tax penalty for bringing home cash from overseas operations is about to go down. Perhaps Honeywell just has some M&A it wants to use the cash for, but the company did go to the trouble earlier this year of laying out an M&A scenario that would see a bigger chunk of its resources designated for non-U.S. takeovers in the event tax reform doesn&apos;t come to pass. At the very least, the company seems to be hedging its bets.Maybe investors should, too.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.

October 28, 2017 By Michael Kozlowski 2 Comments Icarus has released a brand new e-reader that might be the best one they have ever made. The screen is the perfect size for digital reading and Google Play allows users to install any app they want. This device has the perfect blend of screen size and hardware performance.HardwareThe Icarus XL HD features a 7.8 inch E INk Carta display with Regal Waveform. The resolution is 1404×1872 and 300 PPI. Underneath the hood is a 1.8 GHZ processor, 1GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage. It also has a 3.5mm headphone jack that you can use to plug in a pair of headphones or speakers. If you prefer to go wireless this device has Bluetooth.The front-lit display is glorious and it has 10 LED lights which evenly distribute light across the screen. We review a lot of e-readers and normally we can tell exactly where the LED lights are positioned, due to light spillage from the LED lights, the Icarus is the exception. It was challenging to determine exactly where the LED lights were, because the lighting system is really polished. When you first turn the front-lit display on, it has a pale blue hue. After around five minutes the screen tends to warm up and the light is vibrantly white, a real pleasure to use. Unlike a bunch of other e-readers on the market the front-light on the XL can be completely turned off.The XL HD has a number of hidden features that make it easy to use. It has an A2 mode that allows you to quickly use apps that employ animations or to scroll around on the internet. A2 mode basically degrades image quality to increase performance. You can turn it on or off by clicking the WIFI button on the bottom of the screen.One thing I noticed when Peter and I conducted our unboxing video was the retail packaging. Almost every single Icarus e-reader came in a retail box with a picture of the device and specs on the back in many different languages. The XL HD came in a nondescript recycled box with a black and white picture of the e-reader in black and white. I don’t know if Icarus is scaling back or trying to cut costs, but it is worth mentioning because it is really out of the ordinary that they packaged it in this manner.This e-reader employs a 2800mAh battery and should last around two weeks of usage. If you tend to run Android apps, it will likely drain quicker due to the constant state of refreshing. The dimensions are 145 x 200x 9mm, 275 gr. and it retails for $299.SoftwareThe Icarus XL HD is running Android Jellybean, which is 4.2.2. There is a ton of e-readers on the market that also run Android, but they tend to be running 4.0.4. The Icarus downloads apps via Google Play and is compatible with most audiobook, e-reading, music and podcast apps.The main UI comprises of your library, documents, apps and settings. I found that the library function is not working, although there were e-books in the main root folder. Whenever you add an e-book to the root it appears on the homescreen under “Recently added.” Any book you open will also appear on the homescreen.The settings menu is fairly basic. The only thing of note is being able to adjust the refresh rate when you are reading an e-book. They have numerical values from 1-10 and the ability to completely turn off full page refreshes. I would not recommend shutting it off or you might encounter ghosting.There are a number of bugs with the software, but nothing that cannot be fixed with a simple firmware update. When you click on Library, none of your e-books appear there. When you are reading an e-book and click on a word to look it up in the dictionary; nothing happens. You also cannot implement A2 mode unless you are on the homescreen, it does not turn on on any other menu.E-Reading ExperienceThe Amazon Kindle and Nook keep changing fonts, linespacing and margins very simple. They have a few options you can employ, nothing that would confuse your average user. Icarus tends to do things differently with their stock e-reading app. They utilize the points system for increasing the size of the font or the linespacing. They start on 1.2 and can go upwards from there, there is no slider bar.There are a ton of fonts that are preloaded on the stock app and there is no way to add additional fonts. There are around 35 different fonts, most of them are old Android fonts. One of the big problems with old Android fonts is that they were not designed for super high resolution screens. Google actually addressed this issue with the advent of Literata, but it is only available via the Play Books app and is not available for most apps. The sole high resolution font that Icarus employs is Bookerly, which was made famous because the Amazon Kindle uses it as their default font when they abandoned Caecilia.Page turn speed on the Icarus is fine, it does a better job than most. There is no lag or performance degradations. Things tend to take a turn for the worst when you download and install most e-reading apps from Google Play. Amazon, Barnes and Noble, Kobo, Scribd and many others have animated page turns on their apps and there is no way to shut them off. Most people use these apps on their smartphone and tablet and it looks really good, on an e-reader though, animations tend to suffer. Whenever you use the Kindle app to turn a page, you have wait around a second and a half for the pageturn to be completed. Wattpad doesn’t even work on the Icarus, because their app works on an infinite scrolling system and there is no inertia. You literally have to scroll upwards for every new line of text that you want to reveal.One of the big problems in the e-reader industry is that there is no compelling enough reason for any app developer to make an E-Ink version of their app. Android enabled e-readers are on the extreme fringe and a company like Amazon or Kobo would likely not recoup any development costs associated with making an e-ink version of their flagship Android app. This is why people often purchase e-readers that have a built in store and built in e-reading app, instead of a brand like Icarus. You buy a Kindle or a Kobo because those companies developed an e-book reading experience that works in conjunction with their own digital bookstore. It is in their best interest to constantly refine the E-ink experience and offer new features to get people to buy whatever new model they are selling. Icarus on the other hand merely sells the hardware and leaves it up to the user on where they want to buy or download their digital content. On one hand is liberating, but on the other all of the apps you would download from Google Play are not optimized for e-paper displays and involves a ton of experimentation on what works and what doesn’t.Wrap UpThe XL HD is the best e-reader Icarus has ever made. The processor and RAM make most tasks speed along, without any discernable lag. You can listen to audiobooks or music via the 3.5mm headphone jack or utilize Bluetooth. The screen is large and the front-lit display is really solid.Icarus has been developing e-readers for over six years and have a loyal fanebase.

http://www.nasdaq.com/article/interesting-september-2018-stock-options-for-hd-cm863746

Consistently, one of the more popular stocks people enter into their stock options watchlist  at Stock Options Channel is Home Depot Inc (Symbol: HD). So this week we highlight one interesting put contract, and one interesting call contract, from the September 2018 expiration for HD. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting, is at the $140 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $3.50. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 2.5% return against the $140 commitment, or a 2.7% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost  ).      Selling a put does not give an investor access to HD's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. So unless Home Depot Inc sees its shares fall 15.6% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $136.50 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $3.50 from $140), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 2.7% annualized rate of return.  makeArticleAd();  Worth considering, is that the annualized 2.7% figure actually exceeds the 2.1% annualized dividend paid by Home Depot Inc, based on the current share price of $165.81. And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to lose 15.62% to reach the $140 strike price.    Always important when discussing dividends is the fact that, in general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Home Depot Inc, looking at the dividend history chart for HD below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 2.1% annualized dividend yield.    Turning to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the September 2018 expiration, for shareholders of Home Depot Inc (Symbol: HD) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 2.1% annualized dividend yield. Selling the covered call at the $175 strike and collecting the premium based on the $6.75 bid, annualizes to an additional 4.5% rate of return against the current stock price (this is what we at Stock Options Channel refer to as the YieldBoost  ), for a total of 6.6% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $175 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but HD shares would have to advance 5.5% from current levels for that to happen, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 9.6% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.    The chart below shows the trailing twelve month trading history for Home Depot Inc, highlighting in green where the $140 strike is located relative to that history, and highlighting the $175 strike in red:       The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the September 2018 put or call options highlighted in this article deliver a rate of return that represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Home Depot Inc (considering the last 252 trading day HD historical stock prices  using closing values, as well as today's price of $165.81) to be 14%.   Top YieldBoost HD Calls »       Turning to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the September 2018 expiration, for shareholders of Home Depot Inc (Symbol: HD) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 2.1% annualized dividend yield. Selling the covered call at the $175 strike and collecting the premium based on the $6.75 bid, annualizes to an additional 4.5% rate of return against the current stock price (this is what we at Stock Options Channel refer to as the YieldBoost  ), for a total of 6.6% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away.

http://www.nasdaq.com/article/interesting-april-2018-stock-options-for-hal-cm863743

Consistently, one of the more popular stocks people enter into their stock options watchlist  at Stock Options Channel is Halliburton Company (Symbol: HAL). So this week we highlight one interesting put contract, and one interesting call contract, from the April 2018 expiration for HAL. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting, is at the $37.50 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of 96 cents. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 2.6% return against the $37.50 commitment, or a 5.2% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost  ).      Selling a put does not give an investor access to HAL's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. So unless Halliburton Company sees its shares decline 12.7% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $36.54 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the 96 cents from $37.50), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 5.2% annualized rate of return.  makeArticleAd();  Interestingly, that annualized 5.2% figure actually exceeds the 1.7% annualized dividend paid by Halliburton Company by 3.5%, based on the current share price of $42.95. And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to lose 12.67% to reach the $37.50 strike price.    Always important when discussing dividends is the fact that, in general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Halliburton Company, looking at the dividend history chart for HAL below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 1.7% annualized dividend yield.    Turning to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the April 2018 expiration, for shareholders of Halliburton Company (Symbol: HAL) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 1.7% annualized dividend yield. Selling the covered call at the $47.50 strike and collecting the premium based on the $1.14 bid, annualizes to an additional 5.4% rate of return against the current stock price (this is what we at Stock Options Channel refer to as the YieldBoost  ), for a total of 7.1% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $47.50 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but HAL shares would have to advance 10.6% from current levels for that to occur, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 13.3% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.    The chart below shows the trailing twelve month trading history for Halliburton Company, highlighting in green where the $37.50 strike is located relative to that history, and highlighting the $47.50 strike in red:       The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the April 2018 put or call options highlighted in this article deliver a rate of return that represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Halliburton Company (considering the last 252 trading day HAL historical stock prices  using closing values, as well as today's price of $42.95) to be 24%.

Apple   Preorders for the iPhone X sold out within minutes on Thursday, pushing back shipping date estimates for the hotly-anticipated device. Many who were able to quickly place a preorder Thursday didn't get the guarantee that their orders would ship by November 3, when the iPhone X is slated to go on sales in stores. But Apple now appears able to meet more of the early demand for its flagship phone. Shipping dates for a noticeable number of iPhone X preorders that initially were estimated to ship in mid-November have recently been updated to now ship by November 3, as noted by customers who shared their updated estimates from Apple on Reddit and other web forums. The estimate changes seem to mostly apply to preorders that were originally quoted as having a ship date between November 10 and 17. On Saturday, Apple quoted new iPhone X orders as shipping in 5-6 weeks on its website. Due to supply constraints, Apple is expected to only ship 2-3 million iPhone X preorders globally, making the device difficult to find through the holidays. KGI Securities recently cut its forecast for total fourth-quarter iPhone X shipments to 25-30 million units, down from 30-35 million units. Related: Watch original series, sports and more on go90.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock surged on Friday after the company revealed that iPhone X preorders were “off the charts.” It seems like the $1,000 price tag didn’t scare anyone away, and the iPhone X was reportedly sold out in only 10 minutes. There was so much traffic on Apple’s website and on mobile carriers’ websites that many of them crashed under the weight of people who got up in the middle of the night to preorder Apple’s latest and greatest iPhone. Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White said in a note to investors that only those who preordered an iPhone X “in the opening minutes” seem to have gotten a Nov. 3 ship date. Within minutes, shipping times grew first to one to two weeks and then two to three weeks after 30 minutes had passed. He also looked into lead times for the phone in China and reported that they were at five to six weeks on Friday. He predicts that the iPhone X could finally turn the company’s trends in Greater China positive on a quarterly basis in the first half of fiscal 2018 with a return to growth in the year. Reclaiming China would likely give Apple stock a major boost as sales there have been declining since after the iPhone 6 cycle. According to MarketWatch, Cascend Securities analysts conducted their own survey of availability for the iPhone X in the 100 biggest U.S. markets. They learned that in all of them, the iPhone X was sold out on preorder online home delivery within five hours. However, they also reported that some supply was still available in stores, either for purchase online with in-store pickup on Nov. 3, which is launch day. They also said that supply was dwindling fast and expected it to be gone by noon or possibly before. Reports of short supply also spilled over onto social media where people tweeted their frustrations with the Apple Store app, Apple’s website and their mobile carriers’ websites. It seems buyers took our recommendations of keeping multiple browser tabs open when trying to place their preorders, and all the extra traffic crashed the sites. Technical glitches were widespread as some buyers even reported that they preordered within a minute of iPhone X preorders going live in the Apple Store app and still didn’t get a Nov. 3 delivery date. Apple guru and analyst-turned-venture-capitalist Gene Munster took to his traditional habits of checking out demand on the first day of a new iPhone, although these days he’s with Loup Ventures, the venture capital firm he founded. Munster’s team at Loup shared lead times for iPhone X shipping dates on Friday and found that in less than three minutes, all iPhone X models except for those running on the Sprint network had ship times of two to three weeks. By Friday afternoon, lead times were five to six weeks, and Munster wrote in a post on his firm’s website that demand for the phone “is trending more favorable than investor expectations.” Thus, the iPhone X can be credited for Friday’s rally in Apple stock. Apple stock closed up 3.56% at $163.05 on Friday as it approached the 52-week high of $164.64 but just couldn’t get over the bump. Friday was a strong day for tech stocks in general, with Microsoft’s and Intel’s earnings beats Thursday nights driving strong gains in their stocks. The gains in Intel and Microsoft stock added approximately 63 points to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, MarketWatch estimates. Unfortunately, that gain was eaten up by Chevron’s and Merck’s declines after both companies disappointed before the bell on Friday. Apple stock added another 39 points to the Dow, however, resulting in a 22-point gain for the index to close out the week.

https://investorplace.com/2017/10/apple-inc-aapl-stock-3-reasons/

Tech giant Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has seen its shares languish around the $155 mark for the past three months. Investors are questioning whether the company’s latest devices, the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, will be enough to keep the firm’s revenue on the upswing after a brief period of decline. The new iPhones have had a lukewarm reception, as many complain that they are too similar to the 7 models, and others hold out for the iPhone X due out in November. Apple stock’s loss of momentum provides an opportunity to buy, especially considering the fact that AAPL earnings are due out next week. While some are cautious ahead of the fourth quarter results, I think the results will send the stock higher, making now a great entry point. As I mentioned, Apple’s revenue is of utmost importance to investors, especially after the firm reported a revenue decline for the first time ever last year. Since then, Apple has been able to report revenue growth consistently, and this quarter is unlikely to be any different. Apple is expecting to report fourth quarter revenue to be somewhere between $49 billion and $52 billion. That means even if the figures come in at the low end, Apple will be able to report year-over-year growth from last year’s fourth quarter revenue of $46.9 billion. However, in the past, the company’s management has been notoriously conservative when it comes to AAPL earnings guidance, so I think it’s safe to assume that the revenue figures will come in on the higher end of the scale. Some worry about whether the lackluster reception of the iPhone 8 will hurt the firm’s revenue. That’s a valid concern considering that iPhone sales are the meat and potatoes of Apple’s overall revenue. It’s true that people appear to be holding out for the iPhone X, the sales of which won’t impact the fourth quarter results. But I’d imagine that management took this into account when they were making their forecasts. Another big catalyst for AAPL stock is the firm’s ability to continue growing from quarter to quarter. Next week’s AAPL earnings call will likely be dominated by questions about the company’s highly anticipated iPhone X and the projections for its holiday sales. With so many souped-up new features and very few rivals boasting similar capabilities, the iPhone X has a lot of potential to boost Apple’s sales during the holiday shopping season. As HSBC analyst Steven Pelayo pointed out when the bank gave AAPL stock a “Buy” rating, Apple has a lot of loyal customers who are likely waiting for the iPhone X to hit the shelves before they upgrade. That massively loyal customer base gives Apple a wide moat. The buzz around the iPhone X has made it a must-have for people who are dedicated to the Apple ecosystem.

In many cases, a company not being able to satisfy demand is a good problem to have. This may prove to be especially true for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), according to Canaccord Genuity's T. Michael Walkley. Demand for Apple's high-end $1,000 iPhone X will likely prove to be stronger than the company's ability to meet supply in 2017, Walkley wrote in a research report. The iPhone's compelling features, including an OLED display, a strong battery, wireless charging and overall improved functionality will contribute to an estimated 247 million units sold in 2018. Overall, Apple continues to gain market share in the premium-tier smartphone space where it is already a leader, Walkley said (see his track record here). Meanwhile, demand for the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus remains "solid" although weaker versus the iPhone 7 launch. However, this is seen as a positive as it is likely many would be iPhone 8 buyers are waiting for the higher priced iPhone X. Overall, Apple should benefit from a strong global iPhone replacement rate of 26.8 percent in 2017. Encouragingly, the global replacement rate will likely rise to 32.4 percent in 2018 and will then moderate to 29.0 percent in 2018. "This impressive installed base should drive strong iPhone replacement sales and earnings, as well as cash flow generation to fund strong long-term capital returns," Walkley wrote. The analyst maintains a Buy rating on Apple's stock with an unchanged $180 price target.

It’s a great day, and year, to own stock in America’s technology sector. Mostly, the reasons were clear: Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet reported expectation-beating earnings yesterday (Oct. 26) after trading hours, and Apple saw strong demand for its new iPhone X overnight. As for Facebook, apparently a rising tide lifts all boats. By 1:30pm ET today, the market capitalization of those companies increased by $181 billion. For the sake of comparison, Goldman Sachs has a market cap of $93 billion. This year so far has been a big one for these companies, which have added nearly $1 trillion in value. And it’s only October—at current rates, these companies will have accrued that $1 trillion in market capitalization by the end of the year. Who knows, it could even happen next week when Facebook and Apple report earnings.

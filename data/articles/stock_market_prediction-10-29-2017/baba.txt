Everything happens fast nowadays. The curve steepens and shortens especially in the tech world. It’s hard to believe that Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA) has only been up and running for 18 years. During that time Chairman, Jack Ma, has built one of the most formidable global ecommerce companies that is closing in on a half billion dollar market valuation. Being a homegrown mainland Chinese company, BABA has been able to navigate the waters there much more adroitly and profitably that foreign companies. And then, leveraging its scale and suppliers, the company continues to expand its reach in all directions. It listed on the New York Stock Exchange just three years ago facing many naysayers and China bears. BABA has clearly proved them wrong. Since its public listing the stock has delivered returns of 86%. Most of the performance has been in part due to the overall buoyant investor sentiment toward tech companies this year, but during the past few years, BABA has proven that it is a true competitor across multiple industries. But the past is the past, and at the 18th anniversary employee gathering, the focus was all about the future. Ma stated that, “…compared to the future, we have only just come of age. The future holds endless possibilities and imagination for Alibaba…” With a nod towards giving back and doing good for the broader economic community, Ma further emphasized: “Over the past three years we delivered on short-term financial goals, but our true purpose lies in harnessing the power of technology and innovation to make the world economy more inclusive and more healthy toward sustainable development.” Ma’s words may be sound altruistic, but they are built on the success of the company’s underlying enterprise. Taobao Marketplace, Tmall, Juhuasuan (flash sales), and 1688.com all fall under the Alibaba banner. From retail to wholesale to mobile to online, BABA’s presence is felt everywhere. New Retail and New Finance are particularly interesting given what BABA can leverage from its 18 years of deep operational experience. These also happen to be industries ripe for disruption, and BABA is well positioned to be that disruptor.

Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Today I will analyse the most recent data on BABA’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for BABA According to my valuation model, the stock is currently overvalued by about 100%, trading at $177.32 compared to my intrinsic value of $88.68. This means that the opportunity to buy BABA at a good price has disappeared! If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Given that BABA’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility. Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. BABA’s earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value. Are you a shareholder? BABA’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above its fair value. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell? If you believe BABA should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed. Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on BABA for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there’s no upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for BABA, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop. Price is just the tip of the iceberg.

Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA) shares almost doubled since the US presidential elections. As a long-term Alibaba Group Holding Ltd shareholder you may be more determined than ever about the long-term success of BABA shares but one of our favorite hedge fund managers has a better investment idea if you are bullish on BABA. Anthony Bozza’s Lakewood Capital is one of the better performing long-short equity hedge funds in operation today. In its Q3 investor letter Anthony Bozza suggests a better investment idea for long-term Alibaba Group Holding Ltd shareholders (see Lakewood Capital’s 2017 Q3 investor letter).  Here is what Bozza said in his investor letter: Softbank’s primary operating business is its domestic wireless business. The wireless industry in Japan is an oligopoly as three players (NTT Docomo, KDDI and Softbank) control the market. The industry is mature with low churn and stable profitability. Softbank utilizes the cash flow from this business to diversify and grow its investment portfolio. Using a 6x EBITDA multiple, which is consistent with peers, we estimate that this business is worth $65 billion. Softbank’s other primary operating business is ARM Holdings, the U.K.-based licensor of microprocessor technologies that Softbank acquired last year for around $30 billion. Together, we value these businesses at ¥9,850 per share. The bulk of Softbank’s remaining value comes from its public stakes in Alibaba, Sprint and Yahoo! Japan, as well as its significant portfolio of private investments. The company’s 25% stake in Alibaba is worth $120 billion, or ¥12,365 per Softbank share. Softbank also owns 85% of Sprint, a stake worth $24 billion, or ¥2,460 per share. Additionally, Softbank has a ¥1.3 trillion stake (¥1,175 per share) in Yahoo! Japan, a leading internet portal in Japan. While these public stakes alone amount to ¥16,000 per share (60% above the current share price), Softbank also has a portfolio of private investments, consisting primarily of stakes in leading ride hailing and e-commerce platforms in Asia. These investments are valued on the balance sheet at ¥2,300 per share. While we think there could be substantial upside to the private investments over time, we do not ascribe any premium. Together, Softbank’s public and private investments have a gross value of ¥18,300 per share. We think a substantial discount is being placed on Softbank’s public holdings due to the recent rapid appreciation in the value of the Alibaba stake and the market’s persistent focus on uncertainty around the company’s investment in Sprint. While Softbank shareholders have been slow to recognize the increased value of the Alibaba stake, we expect this significant value will ultimately be reflected in the stock price. And, while Sprint is undoubtedly a substantial holding for Softbank, it amounts to less than 15% of the total investment portfolio. Also, an expected merger with T-Mobile would represent a significant positive development as Sprint would become a scale number three player in the consolidated U.S. wireless market. We conservatively apply a 30% discount to all of its investments and arrive at a net value of ¥12,810 per share.

Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) fell by -2.00% in Wednesday’s trading session from $173.70 to $170.22. The price has fallen in 7 of the last 10 days and is down by -7.83% over the same course of time. Volume has increased in Wednesday’s trading session by 6.12 million shares, but on a weak note. This is may be an early warning and the risk will be increased slightly for the next couple of days. In total, 18.02 M shares exchanged hands for about $3 066.59 million. Inside BABA’s Recent Trend Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA) has broken the wide and strong rising short-term trend down. This signalize a slower rising rate, but may also be an early warning about a possible trend shift. Due to trend being broken there will now be resistance at the bottom line of the trend at $173.04. A reaction back to this level may hold a second chance to get out before further falls. Alibaba Group Holding Limited Technical Signals 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 BABA has witnessed its long term and short term MA triggering a sell signal. Many traders watch for long-term averages to cross above short-term averages to signal the beginning of a downtrend. Upon corrections, the price will meet resistance from the averages between $175.32 and $176.29. A buy signal will be generated if it crosses above any of these levels. Its pivot point high generated sell signal on Wednesday October 18, 2017, which calls for additional declines until the stock forms a new pivot point low, as this could be a buying opportunity. Volume up and price depreciating is getting our attention as this movement is seen as bearish sign. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) Support And Resistance Levels Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA) recorded volume accumulation so there will probably be a surplus of buyers at $169.64. In case of gains, the next resistance from accumulated volume will not be far away from today’s level at $171.74, $174.46 and $176.70. 
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Accumulated volume is going to prevent the price from rising further at $171.74 and this action will lead the price to take a temporary pause or stay muted for a few days. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA) Risk Assessment The number of shares changed hands in the stock is good, indicating the interest and low risk associated with it. In the most recent session, the stock price hovered around $6.14 (3.63%) between intraday high and intraday low. Each day in the past 1 week, the average volatility remained at 2.36%.

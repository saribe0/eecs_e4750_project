Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) reported blowout earnings 2 weeks ago. Now, BAC stock is trading at its highest level since the Great Recession. The majority of BofA’s run to decade highs has happened since Donald J. Trump won the Presidential election. Since then, BAC stock is up some 60% on the hopes of higher interest rates and less regulation. But I think this most recent leg higher is the beginning of the end of the rally for BofA stock. The harsh reality is that interest rates will remain lower for longer, thanks to automated technology threatening huge swaths of the labor market. Without higher interest rates, BofA’s net interest income won’t grow at the rate it has been growing. Without robust growth in net interest income, BofA stock will fall back. It’s only a matter of time. BofA stock now trades at more than 1.1-times book value. At a 10% premium-to-book value, BAC stock is trading at its richest valuation since before the Great Recession. Clearly, BofA stock is priced with optimistic top- and bottom-line growth expectations. Those optimistic top- and bottom-line growth expectations are fueled primarily by expectations for robust growth in net interest income. For example, take last quarter: Total revenues were up $806 million. The breakdown was a $922 million increase in net interest income and a $116 million decrease in non-interest income. Thus, it’s clear to see that in order for BofA to successfully grow its top and bottom lines, the bank needs net interest income to continue to trend up. In order for that to happen, rates need to go up. Granted, loan and deposit growth will help some, but the big driver here is higher rates. Management said on the third-quarter conference call that a 100 basis-point increase in interest rates would boost net interest income by $3.2 billion over the next 12 months. All in, then, BAC stock is a narrative based almost entirely on higher interest rates fueling robust profit growth. But that narrative breaks down once you understand that rates aren’t going up big any time soon.

 Investors in Bank of America Corporation BAC  need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Oct 27, 2017 $23.50 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.  What is Implied Volatility?  Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an  options trading  strategy.  What do the Analysts Think?  Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Bank of America shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Bank of America is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Banks - Major Regional industry that ranks in the Top 42% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, four analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while three have revised the estimate downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 48 cents per share to 47 cents in that period. Given the way analysts feel about Bank of America right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there's a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.

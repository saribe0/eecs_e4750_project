For every 100,000 births in the US in 2013, the most recent year for which data is available, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) estimates 17.3 mothers died, the highest maternal mortality rate of all industrialized countries—by several times over. But according to another, better estimate, calculated by a team at the Maryland Population Research Center, 23.5 women died per 100,000 live births that year. The reasons for the discrepancy can be traced back to years of woeful collection of data on maternal health in the US. And while most of the world has drastically reduced maternal mortality in the past three decades, the US is one of just a handful of countries where the problem worsened, and significantly. America didn’t always fare so poorly in maternal health. Like most other countries, after the end of World War II, the US saw maternal mortality drop—at least until the late 1980s, when the trend reversed. Historic data from the CDC shows the trend clearly: As most countries doubled-down on their efforts to curb maternal mortality, in a drive to meet a United Nations goal to cut maternal mortality by three quarters globally by 2015, the US began moving in the opposite direction. Maternal mortality fell dramatically around the world (30% according to conservative estimates, 45% per the official UN report) between 1990 and 2015, with most progress made after 2000. In the US, the ratio went up nearly 60% over the same period. Part of the story of why is hidden in the numbers—and the ones about maternal deaths in the US are enough to give epidemiologists a serious headache. First of all, until the early 1990s, there was no systematic collection of maternal mortality data in the country. Reporting of deaths related to pregnancy or childbirth was limited to the narrow classification listed on death certificates at the time: basically, deaths directly caused by “complications of pregnancy, childbirth, and the puerperium.” The certificate collected no information on whether a woman was pregnant at the time of death or had recently given birth, missing all deaths that occurred during pregnancy for non-obstetric causes, like, say, high blood pressure or depression, as well as those that happen after birth. It’s estimated that the spotty reporting that resulted missed up to half of all pregnancy-related deaths. Starting in 1991, some states began to introduce a “pregnancy checkbox” to their death certificates. A question answered separately from the cause of death asked: Though the effort was uncoordinated, it eventually informed a revision of the US standardized death certificate, which was amended in 2003 to include a question determining whether the woman was pregnant at the time of death or had a recent pregnancy. It took several years for the change to be adopted by all states. West Virginia was the last to incorporate the checkboxes, in 2017. This means that many more maternal- and pregnancy-related deaths—defined as happening during pregnancy or within 42 days of delivery, or happening up until a year post delivery—have been reported in the past few years, and that’s had an impact on the reporting of national trends. According to Elliot Main, the medical director of the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative (CMQCC) and a member of the CDC advisory committee on maternal data, it is likely that the incidence of maternal mortality was higher than the official record showed in the years before the reported numbers began increasing. Perhaps because of that, notes Marian MacDorman, a research professor at the Maryland Institute for Population Control who worked on the mortality estimate, the US missed out on the UN-led effort to curb maternal death, and is now “playing catch-up” with other developed nations. To complicate things, though the ratio is high, the actual number of cases isn’t. Just a handful of mistakes in reporting pregnancy-related deaths can skew results. As a result, the data collected on death certificates aren’t considered final. State-by-state data are routinely reviewed by Maternal Mortality Review Committees (MMRCs)—review groups in around half of US states, started either as public-health initiatives or by state OB-GYN societies—that look at the records of maternal mortality and assess preventability, as well as whether the deaths are indeed a consequence of the pregnancy, rather than merely coinciding with it. Unfortunately, the official CDC data are not updated to reflect the findings of the committees, which means the national numbers on record aren’t just likely to be inaccurate—they are known to be wrong. This is why there is such a discrepancy between the estimated ratio, 26.4 in 2015, and the numbers shared by the CDC (in the chart above). It is also one of the reasons why the US has failed to publish an official maternal mortality rate since 2007—“it’s inexcusable,” comments MacDorman. “It’s not a very clearly reported area,” Eugene Declercq, a professor of community health sciences at Boston University told Quartz. He has collaborated with MacDorman and others to calculate the current estimate (pdf), and founded the site Birth by the Numbers. In non-scientist terms, data-collection about maternal mortality is a shambles, a symptom of a health care system that has placed insufficient emphasis on maternal health. Quartz in a separate article explored the reasons why American women must risk their lives in greater numbers than their peers in other wealthy countries, simply to have a baby. In the past few years, however, there has been growing awareness of the tragedy of maternal mortality, and “there is a lot of momentum on the quality of data collection,” says David Goodman, senior scientist for the CDC’s Maternal and Child Health Epidemiology Program. A promising effort, he says, is Review to Action, an initiative to pull together the findings of the MMRCs. So far, he says, review committees exist in 27 states, three more should open within a year, and eight are in the planning. The aim is to soon be able to compare findings. “[MMRCs] have existed in the US for a century independently from one another,” says Goodman, but “over the past five years [the CDC] has provided coordination, with the goal of coming up with a higher-level review.” The CDC isn’t involved directly in the reviews, but provides technical support, and promotes standardization of data to make it comparable. Despite the discrepancies in the official rates—and whether or not there has been a steep increase in maternal mortality in the past few years, or instead the number was higher than believed in the past—one thing is for sure, says Main, “Either way we look at them, [the numbers] are high.”

http://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/heathrow-secret-security-data-found-memory-stick-london-street-a8025516.html

Were the files downloaded by a hacker or an airport insider? Heathrow Airport’s secret security planning has been revealed in files on a memory stick found in a London street. The documents outline routes and safeguards for the Queen, foreign dignitaries and top politicians using Britain’s busiest airport. The USB drive also includes maps showing where CCTV cameras are located, and escape routes for the Heathrow Express railway serving the airport. Other files describe the ultrasound detection system for protecting the perimeter fence and the runways, and detail the ID requirements for accessing every area of the airport. A man found the memory stick in Ilbert Street, London W10, just 10 miles from Heathrow. Several days later, he took the device to his local library and studied the contents. When he realised the security implications, he approached the Sunday Mirror. The unencrypted files may have been hacked, then downloaded and transferred to the memory stick, which would raise serious concerns about cyber security.  But given the location of the find, close to Heathrow, it is thought more likely that an airport worker had accessed the data and inadvertently lost the USB drive. That raises two further possibilities. If a staff member or contractor had illicitly downloaded the files, it would again call into question security standards. But it is believed more likely that whoever lost the memory stick had security clearance to access the data, if not necessarily to take the information away from Heathrow on a portable drive. The airport has issued a statement about the discovery: “The UK and Heathrow have some of the most robust aviation security measures in the world and we remain vigilant to evolving threats by updating our procedures on a daily basis.  “We have reviewed all of our security plans and are confident that Heathrow remains secure. We have also launched an internal investigation to understand how this happened and are taking steps to prevent a similar occurrence in future.” The discovery could trigger diplomatic tension between London and Washington about aviation security standards. This week airlines flying to America were instructed to impose tighter security rules because of fears at the Department of Homeland Security about another attack on US-bound jets.

Back in 2015, privacy campaigners became aware of a new Wi-Fi-connected toy that raised considerable concern. At issue was Hello Barbie, a doll with speech recognition technology that could hold a two-way conversation with a child. Parents and others grew concerned when it became clear that childrenâs conversations would be stored on cloud servers and used in various ways by Mattel, the toy maker. At the time, Forbes reported that the toyâs terms and conditions allowed the sharing of âaudio recordings with third party vendors who assist us with speech recognition.â This system had the potential to reveal and share a childâs innermost thoughts. And it raised a wide range of ethical questions. For example, what is the appropriate response if a child asks âWhat should I be when I grow up?â The episode is emblematic of a much bigger question: How should childrenâs interests be represented in the debate about privacy and big data? Today, Gabrielle Berman and Kerry Albright from the UNICEF Office of Research in Florence, Italy, argue that childrenâs rights have been underrepresented in this area. âDue to the potential for severe, long-lasting and differential impacts on children, child rights need to be firmly integrated onto the agendas of global debates about ethics and data science,â they say. Privacy issues are always complex, but they have greater relevance for children than ever before. Data is being collected and processed on a previously unimaginable scale that is growing at a fantastic rate. âThis accumulation implies that more data will be collected on children over their lifetime than ever before,â say Berman and Albright. Clearly, there will be benefits. Health experts hope to use this data to personalize and improve medicine, for example. Others hope to deliver better services tailored more precisely to each personâs needs. The next generation has the most to gain from these benefits But there are disadvantages, too. One problem is the persistence of dataâthe information gathered about children and teenagers could be tied to them by third parties throughout their lives. This is being addressed by the âright to be forgotten,â which allows people in Europe to have historical information about them deleted in certain circumstances. Indeed, there are special provisions within European legislation about how this applies to information about children. Another concern is the spread of data beyond the parties who have collected it. Though anonymization techniques often prevent the data from being linked to specific individuals, there are various ways in which data can later be de-anonymized. Then there are the unknown consequences of future data processing techniques. Nobody is sure how the data that is gathered today will be used in the future. For example, social services in countries such as New Zealand and the U.S. already use data gathered about families to identify children who are at risk. Certain educational establishments use data gathered about students to predict how well they will do and to make decisions about their future. It is not at all clear that these applications were apparent when the data was gathered. An important question is whether the actions taken as a result of this data processing are themselves creating undesired outcomes. Finally, there is the issue of informed consent. In Europe, parents of children under 13 must give consent in order for data to be collected. But there is less protection for older children. An important issue is how to present children with the information they need to decide whether to accept terms and conditions, and how this should change as they get older. This is particularly tricky when future uses of the data are unknown. Berman and Albright say there needs to be a significant effort to better represent the interests of children in this debate, particularly when children in some parts of the world are significantly less well protected than others. âIn an era of increasing dependence on data science and big data, the voices of one set of major stakeholdersâthe worldâs children and those who advocate on their behalfâhave been largely absent,â they say. Thatâs troubling, and a good reason to refocus efforts now.

http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/27/politics/rebekah-mercer-cambridge-analytica-clinton-emails/index.html

By Dana Bash and Marshall Cohen, CNN  Updated 6:57 PM ET, Fri October 27, 2017  Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.   (CNN)Cambridge Analytica funder and Trump donor Rebekah Mercer received an email in August 2016 from someone she had recently met at a political event, suggesting that they create a searchable data base for Hillary Clinton emails in the public domain.   

http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/trump-donor-asked-data-firm-index-wikileaks-emails-article-1.3594500


	GOP mega-donor Rebekah Mercer emailed the CEO of a data science firm working on Donald Trump’s presidential campaign to ask if the hacked Clinton-related emails published by WikiLeaks could be indexed in a searchable database, it has been reported. 
	Mercer, a highly influential political donor who along with her family has contributed tens of millions of dollars to conservative causes, reportedly emailed Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix in August 2016, according to the Wall Street Journal. 
	Mercer, who initially supported Sen. Ted Cruz’s presidential bid, later endorsed Trump and introduced both Steve Bannon and Kellyanne Conway as key figures in his campaign. 
	She received a suggestion from someone she met at an event for Cruz that the WikiLeaks emails should be indexed or otherwise organized to make them more searchable, a source to the WSJ.  First charges in Russian meddling probe prove it's no witch hunt  
	Mercer forwarded the suggestion to Nix, who responded saying he had reached out to Julian Assange in June 2016 before the emails were released to ask if he might share the documents with Cambridge Analytica. Assange had turned him down, Nix said. 
	WikiLeaks, which obtained emails from both the hacked accounts of Clinton campaign manager John Podesta and the Democratic National Committee, started releasing the documents in July 2016. 
	Just one week later, Cambridge Analytica, which is financially backed by Mercer’s father Robert Mercer, received its first payment from the Trump campaign for its “data management services." 
	U.S. intelligence agencies later concluded Russians hacked the accounts and turned the emails over to WikiLeaks, although Assange has adamantly denied the source.  First charges approved in Robert Mueller's Russia investigation  
	Trump's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner and digital director Brad Parscale hired the big data company known for political marketing and micotargeting. 
	The House Intelligence Committee has requested information from Cambridge Analytica as part of its investigation into Russia's involvement in the elections. 
	Members of the committee have also questioned whether the company may have helped Russians target American voters on social media during the presidential campaign.

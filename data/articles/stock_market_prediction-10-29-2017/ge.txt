The dismemberment of Jeff Immelt's legacy continues. Citing sources familiar with the matter, the WSJ reports General Electric (NYSE:GE) executives as not notifying the board about the practice of trailing the former CEO with a spare jet anytime he traveled. Until the Journal this month first reported on the matter, management for years also withheld from directors an internal complaint it received about the empty plane. Like Captain Renault in Casablanca, the board members were shocked to learn of the practice. "Obviously, this was an excess," one tells the WSJ. For his part, Immelt tells the paper he too was unaware of the spare plane, and wouldn't have allowed it had he known. New CEO John Flannery, of course, has grounded the company's corporate fleet as he looks to cut costs throughout the company.

For GE, this was the week from hell: Shares sank 12.7% in their worst weekly drop since March 2009 - the month when the S&P 500 sank to its financial crisis lows - and wiped out $26B of market value to end at a five-year low. GE is the worst performer by far on the Dow in 2017, down 34.6% vs. the S&P's 18.5% gain, bringing the loss for GE shareholders this year to $100B. It seems no one wants to be the last man standing when GE presumably cuts its dividend - something it has done only twice in its 125-year history, both during economic crises - when CEO John Flannery reveals his turnaround plan on Nov. 13. Without a cut, Flannery’s plan to divest $20B of assets likely would be just another stopgap that actually would exacerbate the cash crunch by reducing free cash flow - a continuation of a pattern that helped create GE’s current predicament, Bloomberg's Brooke Sutherland writes. Analysts jumped in with at least four downgrades this week (I, II), but for a contrarian view, DRIP Investor thinks the stock could be worth buying at ~$20, citing the company's executive housecleaning, activist investors stirring the pot, recent insider buying and the potential for spinoffs and restructurings.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-27/ge-is-exception-to-strong-industrial-earnings

Industrial companies not named General Electric Co. are actually doing pretty OK these days. But with many trading at or near records, a lot of the good news is already baked in.   It&apos;s about halfway through earnings season for manufacturers, and most reports so far have earned a positive reception from investors. That&apos;s for good reason: Broadly speaking, these firms are relying more on revenue growth, rather than cost-cuts or financial engineering, to meet their earnings guidance. Many are even raising those outlooks, in sharp contrast to GE&apos;s painful cut. RBC analyst Deane Dray calculates that companies in his coverage area have reported an average of 4 percent organic sales growth thus far for the third quarter. That compares with a decline of 2.7 percent for the year-earlier period. Post-it note maker 3M Co. in particular stands out with a 6.6 percent increase in sales excluding the impact of currency swings and M&A -- its best showing since 2011.  That recovery is helping to justify the 25 percent climb in the S&P 500 Industrials Index over the past year, a return that&apos;s bested the broader benchmark. But the multiples that have resulted from that gain should make investors a bit nervous. Take 3M. Its shares are up more than 12 percent since the end of the second quarter. A big chunk of that could arguably be attributed to a swing of capital away from GE as investors realize it&apos;s perhaps not the defensive, quality company they had thought. But 3M is now valued at 28 times its trailing 12-month earnings, its highest multiple since 2003. A lot of things have to go right -- and stay right -- for that and other high valuations to make sense. And it&apos;s not like there aren&apos;t any potential fault-lines. W.W. Grainger Inc. shares climbed by more than 12 percent after the company said Oct. 17 that its profit had eroded less than feared amid online competition. A week later, Amazon.com Inc. launched Prime membership (with free shipping) for businesses, ratcheting up the pressure and bruising Grainger&apos;s stock. Back to 3M: pricing on its products was flat in the third quarter, or up 0.2 percent excluding its troubled electronics division. That made investors less worried that the company might also see an Amazon-sized whack to its margins, particularly on consumer-facing products like Post-its. But those concerns will likely continue to linger as Amazon expands its business-focused operations. Likewise, companies such as United Technologies Corp. and Ingersoll-Rand Plc weren&apos;t able to pass on sufficient enough price increases in parts of their climate-control businesses to offset rising material costs.  The sky-high valuations also imply investors are looking for at least some benefit from tax reform, which still remains more of a theoretical possibility than a reality. For what it&apos;s worth, Honeywell International Inc. Chief Financial Officer Tom Szlosek told Bloomberg News the company has repatriated some $1 billion of cash this year. That&apos;s a curious thing to do if you believe that the tax penalty for bringing home cash from overseas operations is about to go down. Perhaps Honeywell just has some M&A it wants to use the cash for, but the company did go to the trouble earlier this year of laying out an M&A scenario that would see a bigger chunk of its resources designated for non-U.S. takeovers in the event tax reform doesn&apos;t come to pass. At the very least, the company seems to be hedging its bets. Maybe investors should, too. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.

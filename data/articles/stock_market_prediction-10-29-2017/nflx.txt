 The day before Netflix (NFLX) is set to release the second season of its hit original series Stranger Things  , let's take a look at why the streaming service is still a great growth investment despite already soaring over the last few years. As many investors already know, growth stocks can be a ton of fun because they present the opportunity for potentially massive returns. With that said, investors can't just pick stocks at random and hope they turn into the next Amazon AMZN  . What they can do, however, is look for companies that currently present the possibility for hefty gains based on real growth opportunities within a business. Based on these criteria, growth-minded investors might think about taking a long look at Netflix. Last quarter, Netflix revenues jumped 33% in its all-important streaming sector. On top of that, the video-streaming powerhouse added 5.3 million subscribers-pushing the company's total to 109.3 million worldwide. The company projects that it will add another 6.3 million subscriptions this quarter. Netflix also announced plans to spend up to $8 billion on content in 2018. Looking ahead, Netflix's revenues are projected to climb over 32% next quarter, based on our current consensus estimates. The company's full-year revenues are also expected to leap around 30% to hit an upward estimate of $11.72 billion. Netflix is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and also sports an "A" for Momentum in our Style Scores system. And within the last 60 days, the company has received 13 upward earnings estimate revisions for its Q4 along with no downward revisions. During this same time frame, Netflix earned 13 upward revisions for its full-year.  Netflix, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise     Netflix, Inc.

In addition to its other growth-based metrics, Netflix's stock price currently rests 5% below its 52-week high.

https://www.stocknewsgazette.com/2017/10/27/heres-a-quick-technical-analysis-of-netflix-inc-nflx/

Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) gained 0.74% in yesterday’s session, going up from its prior closing price of $193.77 to $195.21. The price has fallen in 6 of the last 10 days and is down by -0.33% over the same course of time. Trading activity decreased by -0.13 million shares, and in total, 5.15 M shares exchanged hands for about $1 006.20 million. It should be noted that increasing price and decreasing volume show lack of interest and this is a warning that something has fundamentally changed. Inside NFLX’s Recent Trend Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) lies in the middle of a wide and strong rising trend in the short term and issued considerable signs about additional rally. Short-term traders are predicted to see a rally of 13.85% over the course of a quarter and, with 90% chance the price will be floating in the range of $208.10 and $234.31 in this timeframe. Netflix, Inc. Technical Signals 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 NFLX has witnessed its long term and short term MA triggering a buy signal. Many traders watch for short-term averages to cross above long-term averages to signal the beginning of a uptrend. Upon corrections, the price will meet support from the averages between $194.61 and $188.73. A break down through these support points will trigger sell signals. There was a decrease in volume but the price rose. This is usually not interpreted as a good sign as traders widely believe falling volume should see declining stock. Investors should be watching the price action like a hawk in the coming sessions. Some other technical concerns emerged as well, putting in risk the future growth of the stock in the next couple of days. Its pivot point high generated sell signal on Tuesday October 24, 2017, which calls for additional declines until the stock forms a new pivot point low, as this could be a buying opportunity. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) Support And Resistance Levels Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) recorded volume accumulation so there will probably be a surplus of buyers at $194.39. In case of gains, the next resistance from accumulated volume will not be far away from today’s level at $198.02, $199.48 and $202.68. 
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Accumulated volume is going to prevent the price from rising further at $198.02 and this action will lead the price to take a temporary pause or stay muted for a few days. Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) Risk Assessment A volatility based measure Bollinger Bands suggests this stock poses high risk. In the most recent session, the stock price hovered around $3.53 between high and low, or 1.82%. The average volatility for the past week stood at 2.01%.

On a dry day in July seven years ago, Reed Hastings made a huge mistake. The chief executive of Netflix, who rarely makes massive missteps, surprised customers with the news that the company was scrapping its popular $10-a-month DVD and streaming-video package and replacing it with two separate services—one for DVD rentals, which Netflix was hoping to spin off into a company called Qwikster (a plan that failed), and another for streaming video, the service that would come to define Netflix and later house its original content. Each package would cost $7.99 a month, or a total of $15.98 for the pair, starting that September. It was effectively a 60% rate hike from what customers were paying. Hastings reportedly thought any pushback from customers would be small and fade quickly. But the company lost 800,000 subscribers during the quarter it imposed the hike. And Netflix’s stock price plummeted in the months that followed, erasing more than $11 billion in shareholder wealth in a year, USA Today reported around the anniversary of the announcement. For those investors who stuck around, it was more than worth it. The stock is now one of the hottest around. And Netflix’s subscriber base has more than bounced back, surpassing 100 million this year. When Netflix raised rates this month, it increased the price of its most popular plan in the US by $1 and its premium package by $2. The hike hit new signups first and is still rolling out to existing users—a strategy Netflix uses to give people time to adjust. The company, shrewdly, did not touch the basic plan—its cheapest offering at $7.99 a month—so that folks on tighter budgets could still afford the service. Unlike seven years ago, the move pushed Netflix’s stock to new heights. The key, for Netflix’s management, was learning to raise prices without spooking subscribers—by doing so in small and infrequent doses. “Any time a service increases its price, that change causes consumers to re-assess their perceived value of the service,” Brett Sappington, senior director of research at the firm Parks Associates, tells Quartz. “While most will continue as subscribers, some will consider other options or discontinue their subscription. The key for Netflix is to not cause consumers to enter the evaluation or shopping cycle too often.” This is especially true now that there are other viable options for subscribers to jump to, like Amazon Prime Video or Hulu, neither of which have raised rates recently. (Though Hulu is undercutting its rival.) Netflix only hiked prices in the US and a few other established markets like the UK and Canada this year, so it could conceivably raise rates internationally in the near future without falling into the trap Sappington warned about. “It’s pretty clear that one will follow,” another analyst, Clement Thibault at Investing.com, said of a hike abroad. Netflix’s international base is now its largest, but the US is still the bigger revenue driver. Netflix has been careful not to raise rates too quickly in markets where it’s still building out its library and launching originals geared toward local audiences. It needs to become a service its customers can’t live without, before they rethink its value. Netflix launched in Australia two years ago and hiked prices for the first time this year. That was only when a new digital tax was imposed, which some call the “Netflix tax.” “It’s true we may not choose to raise prices in a market that we’re only a year to 18 months old in,” said David Wells, the company’s chief financial officer, on Netflix’s most recent earnings call, “specifically around markets that we didn’t have a tailored library launch.” Some analysts expect and welcome another modest price lift in the US next year to cover the rising cost of Netflix’s content. An extra dollar here and there, if Netflix continues to add new “must-watch” series and movies all the time, shouldn’t dent its base too badly. This quarter, while the new rates roll out in the US, Netflix is releasing the highly anticipated second season of Stranger Things, much-hyped new series like Mindhunter and Godless, and movies like Bright. For Netflix, quality equals quantity. “Price is all relative to value,” said Hastings, on his company’s latest conference call. “We’re continuing to increase the content offering, and we’re seeing that reflected in viewing around the world. So, we try to maintain that feeling that consumers have that we’re a great value in terms of the amount of content we have relative to the prices.” And, for a lot of people, Netflix is still pretty good value for the thousands of titles it offers. Analysts at Bernstein said a majority of people they interviewed in focus groups this year said they’d be willing to pay up to $15 a month for Netflix. “The general consensus and public perception of Netflix as the default streaming company without a doubt gives it some pricing power,” said Thibault, the analyst at Investing.com. He argues that Netflix may have to hike rates more regularly to keep up with its “incredible rate of spending.” The company plans to spend up to $8 billion on content next year, up from $6 billion this year. Just as long as it continues to do so slow and low. Read next: In the battle between Netflix and everyone else, investors are betting heavily on Netflix

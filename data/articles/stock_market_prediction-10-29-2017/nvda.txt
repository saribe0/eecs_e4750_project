On Wednesday, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) fell 13.5% despite beating earnings and revenue expectations. The company said revenue will decline sequentially by 12% to 18%. However, management boosted its full-year sales estimates. Still, shares were hammered. Could the same thing happen to NVDA stock when Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) reports fiscal third-quarter 2018 earnings on Nov. 11? Source: Shutterstock Plenty of investors have been looking at NVDA stock price today for clues as to what it might do. On Wednesday, it fell 2.5% in sympathy to AMD after previously nearing its 52-week high just under $200 a share. The big question is, what will it do leading to up and after NVDA earnings? The NVDA news has been good. Business demand remains robust. It’s well positioned in every meaningful tech growth market, including self-driving cars, artificial intelligence (AI), data-centers, cloud-computing, and graphic cards used in gaming and cryptocurrencies. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips All of that growth has put an immense valuation on Nvidia, with NVDA stock trading at 48 times forward earnings estimates. It may be forecast to grow 41% this year, but that growth slows to just 10.7% next year (fiscal 2019). Perhaps this forecast is too low. Even if we were to double it to 21%, I would still fold on a stock trading at 48 times earnings. Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB), Alibaba Holding Group Ltd (NYSE:BABA) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) actually have better growth rates and trade at roughly half the premium. So why pay up so much for NVDA, which notably, also trades at 14x sales? We all know self-driving cars, AI, and cloud storage will be highly relevant in the years to come. We don’t know who will win those wars — be it the battle between Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) and General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), or the cloud war between Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). However, we know that no matter which company or companies win, the one constant helping to power it all will be Nvidia. That’s why investors feel comfortable bidding up the stock to unimaginable heights. That’s why shares are up more than 80% in 2017, 170% in the past 12 months and 580% over the past two years. Does NVDA stock price today justify its future realities? It does, but it also limits how much upside could be left. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) has a market cap of $190 billion. NVDA stock is up to a $116 billion valuation. But despite having 61% of the market cap as INTC, NVDA’s sales are just one-seventh (~14.4%) the size. I definitely like Nvidia. Many have made the case it can go to $250. Longer term, I definitely don’t disagree. We know Nvidia is and will remain a powerhouse, but finding the right risk/reward balance is key.   Nvidia has beat earnings and revenue expectations in eight straight quarters. In 2016, each report led to another explosive rally. So far in 2017 though, those explosions are toning down. Only once did NVDA stock pop big, in May, after months of consolidation and it being slightly lower through five months of the year. Other than that, we’ve had near-flat reactions in February and August post-earnings. More and more investors have been pricing in good results, bidding the stock up into the report and leaving little upside left when Nvidia reports good results.  Click to Enlarge That seems to be happening now. NVDA stock is up 12% since its last report and keeps bumping into $200. So will NVDA plunge like AMD after earnings? If it sells off beforehand, I don’t think so. But if it rallies into the event, there could be issues moving higher in the short-term. I think the best thing that can happen is that AMD’s results weigh on NVDA. Intel will report on Oct. 26. A “so-so” reaction to this overbought name could weigh on Nvidia, too. That might be for the best, though. If we can get Nvidia down into the $175 to $185 range ahead of its own report, it will leave it with some ability to power higher on good results. For traders, $180 to $190 should act as support. For long-term investors looking to buy though, we have to wait. A market-wide pullback will eventually come to fruition. We’ve now had the longest streak ever in the S&P 500 without a 3% pullback. Eventually it will come and high-octane stocks like NVDA will get hit. Pounce when that happens.

NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) can do no wrong. If you bought this designer of graphics processing chips in early 2015, you have what is called a “ten-bagger.” The price is up 10-fold since then, opening for trade today at about $197 per share. Back in early 2015, it was a $20 stock. Everybody loves NVIDIA. A TV host renamed his dog for the stock. The company’s chips and boards are at the heart of all the hottest markets, from artificial intelligence to cloud to self-driving cars and gaming. They’re way ahead in those markets. Analysts keep raising their price targets.  That said, does it really make sense to pay 56 times earnings for a chip stock? The company could do $9 billion in business, maybe, for the year that ends in January. But can it really be worth $117 billion when insiders keep selling?  The insider “selling” is easy to explain. When stock is part of your compensation package, you sell some of that stock to upgrade your lifestyle. Insiders are selling fewer shares than they did a few years ago. Each share is just worth so much more, it looks like they’re selling more. What has some NVIDIA bulls thinking of joining the selling is the fact that giant Intel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC) has finally awoken to the NVDA threat, releasing a chip called Nervana aimed at artificial intelligence by the end of 2017.  Intel has been gearing up for a year, buying AI chip start-ups like Nervana, even talking to Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) on design issues. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is also producing its own Tensor processing unit for AI applications in its cloud, which brings up the second potential threat to NVIDIA’s growth.

https://www.nystocknews.com/2017/10/24/what-the-insider-data-suggests-about-nvidia-corporation-nvda/

Recent trading patterns in the stock of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) have investors on high alert. Many experts agree that the best way to predict future performance is by studying the past. In the cast of NVDA, these trading patterns could have some important implications for future performance. In the most recent quarter, institutional ownership decreased by a net of 7.62 million shares, or 1.89%. This is a bearish sign and indicates that institutions are feeling more pessimistic about the outlook for NVDA overall. 493 holders increased their positions, 420 decreased their positions, and 90 holders held their positions. Among institutions that increased their positions, 147 were new positions. Among holders that decreased their positions, 83 sold out of the stock NVIDIA Corporation. Insider ownership during the latest quarter decreased by a net of 763208 shares, indicating that NVDA’s key executives are feeling more bearish about the stock than they did three months ago. 4 or 19.05% of the trades during the past quarter were buys, and 17 or 80.95% were sells. This activity represents a continuation of a theme over the past twelve months. Insider ownership during the last year has decreased by a net of 2.14 million shares. 27.38% of insider trades in the last 12 months were buys, and 72.62% were sells. Over the past year, the price of NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) has increased 191.12% while the S&P 500 has increased 19.69%. During the past 20 days, NVDA has increased 14.98% while the broad market has increased 2.88%. NVDA ‘s 20-day moving average currently sits below its 100-day moving average. This is a bearish signal that suggests the stock price might have farther to fall. NVDA’s average trading volume during the past 20 days is higher than the average volume over the past 100 days, which could be an indication that investors are feeling more certain than usual about the direction of NVDA’s future price movements. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has a 20-day RSI of 68.98%. According to this momentum indicator, a reading between 30 and 70 suggests the stock is not especially cheap or expensive, and not on the brink of a trend reversal. The MACD tells a different story. NVDA’s 9-day MACD currently sits below the 20-day MACD, indicating that NVDA’s upside momentum has decreased during the last three weeks. This suggests that the trend might soon reverse. NVDA’s average trading volatility during the past few weeks is -61.42% lower than the average volatility over the past 100 days. This means that the stock’s daily price swings have been less extreme in recent times compared to the past. Analysts expect NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) to generate earnings per share of $3.61 in 2017. This works out to an increase of 40.47% compared to last year’s earnings. For comparison’s sake, analysts expect the S&P 500 to grow earnings by an average of 12% in 2017. The average investment rating for NVDA on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong sell and 5 being a strong buy) is a 3.68 or a Hold. Three months ago, analysts assigned NVDA a 3.89 rating, which implies that analysts have become more pessimistic about the outlook for the stock over the next year.

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) fell by -0.14% in Monday’s trading session from $196.90 to $196.62 and has now fallen 3 consecutive sessions. The stock price went upward in 6 of the last 10 days and has generated 6.06% during the last two weeks. There was a decrease in both volume and price. This is usually interpreted as a good sign as traders widely believe falling stock should see declining volume. Traded activity experienced a fall of -0.45 million shares and in total 10.66 M shares exchanged hands for about $2 096.59 million. Inside NVDA’s Recent Trend NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) lies in the upper part of a wide and strong rising trend in the short term, and this will normally pose a very good selling opportunity for the short-term trader as reaction back towards the lower part of the trend can be expected. A break-up at the top trend line at $200.49 will firstly indicate a stronger raising rate. Short-term traders are predicted to see a rally of 19.58% over the course of a quarter and, with 90% chance the price will be floating in the range of $214.75 and $239.75 in this timeframe. NVIDIA Corporation Technical Signals 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 NVDA has witnessed its short term MA triggering a sell signal. Meanwhile, however, the long-term average has generated a buy signal. When the short-run moving average rises above its longer-term trend, a buy signal is created. This is because a short-run moving average that crosses its long-run moving average counterpart is seen as the initiation of an upward trend. On additional rally, the share price will meet short term resistance at around $197.02. On a drop, the stock is likely to find some support over the long run, which begins at $181.45. A buy signal will be generated if it crosses above the short term moving average. Meanwhile, however, a price crossing below the long term moving average will generate a sell signal. Some other technical concerns emerged as well, putting in risk the future growth of the stock in the next couple of days. Its pivot point high generated sell signal on Monday October 16, 2017, which calls for additional declines until the stock forms a new pivot point low, as this could be a buying opportunity. The downbeat movement of both volume and price during the recent session is interpreted as a good sign because traders usually believe falling stock should see declining volume. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Support And Resistance Levels RSI14 is 92 and the stock is extremely overbought on RSI14, so further reactions should be expected. Some stocks may have a long and hard correction after reaching so high an RSI, but not in all cases. However, the short-term risk has increased drastically and larger movements in the next couple of days can be expected. 
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 NVIDIA Corporation recorded volume accumulation so there will probably be a surplus of buyers at $187.55. In case of gains, the next resistance from accumulated volume will not be far away from today’s level at $197.58, $197.80 and $197.93. NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Risk Assessment Accumulated volume is going to prevent the price from rising further at $197.58 and this action will lead the price to take a temporary pause or stay muted for a few days. A volatility based measure Bollinger Bands suggests this stock poses high risk. In the most recent session, the stock price hovered around $3.05 between high and low, or 1.56%. The average volatility for the past week stood at 1.96%.

Welles Wilder, is a momentum oscillator that calculates the speed and change of price movements. The RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually the RSI is considered overbought when above 70 and oversold when less than 30. Relative strength index (RSI-14) for NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) is at 76.24. Price Target A price target is the projected price level of a financial security stated by an investment analyst. It represents a security’s price that, if achieved, results in a trader recognizing the best possible outcome for his investment. This is the price at which the trader or investor wants to exit his existing position so he can realize the most reward. Basically, a price target is an individual analyst’s projection on the future price of a stock. There is no concrete way to calculate a price target. Different analysts and financial institutions use various valuation methods and consider different economic forces when deciding on a price target. NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) has been given an average price target of $169.55 from analysts, according to data collected by Finviz. Earnings Forecast Earnings per share (EPS) is the portion of a company’s profit allocated to each outstanding share of common stock. Earnings per share serves as an indicator of a company’s profitability. Consensus earnings estimates are far from perfect, but they are watched by many investors and play an important role in measuring the appropriate valuation for a stock. Investors measure stock performance on the basis of a company’s earnings power. To make a proper assessment, investors seek a sound estimate of this year’s and next year’s earnings per share (EPS), as well as a strong sense of how much the company will earn even farther down the road. Maximum and minimum EPS estimate for the current quarter is projected at $0.91 and $0.79, respectively, according to 21 analysts. Comparatively, NVIDIA Corporation posted earnings of $0 per share in the same quarter last year. The company is expected to report earnings of $0.94 a share for the next quarter. Revenue Estimate Revenue is the amount of money that a company actually receives during a specific period, including discounts and deductions for returned merchandise. It is the “top line” or “gross income” figure from which costs are subtracted to determine net income. NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) is expected to post revenue of $2.11 Billion in the current quarter, according to consensus of 26 analysts. The high and low revenue estimates for the current quarter are $2.14 Billion and $2.09 Billion, respectively. The company reported revenue of $0 in the same period last year. Moving Averages A moving average (MA) is a trend-following or lagging indicator because it is based on past prices. The average is taken over a specific period of time, like 10 days, 20 minutes, 30 weeks, or any time period the trader chooses.

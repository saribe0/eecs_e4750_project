 Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that WMT may be headed in the future. If we want to get a sense of WMT’s future performance, we have to look at the speed and size of these price movements. Using what are known as momentum indicators, we can use the stock’s price momentum to get a sense of whether the stock is in the midst of, or nearing the end of, a current trend. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for WMT is 73.29%, which suggests that the stock may be primed for a trend reversal or a corrective pullback in price. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 94.57%, tells a similar story, and suggests that WMT currently trades in overbought territory. What do the trading volumes reveal? Volume patterns can also be useful for predicting future performance. When trading activity is abnormally high, it’s often a sign that the market feels particularly strong in one way or another about the future direction of a stock. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) average trading volume of 9,472,580 during the past month is 7.33% above its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been more active than usual in the stock in recent times. What do the analysts think? WMT is currently overvalued by 1.93% relative to the average 1-year price target of $86.94 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 2.40, which implies that analysts are generally neutral in their outlook for WMT over the next year. How risky is the stock?  No study on the valuation of a stock is complete without taking into account risk. When analyzing the systematic risk associated with a stock, analysts look at beta, which measures the stock’s volatility relative to the overall market. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has a beta of 0.33, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are less extreme than the market as a whole. WMT therefore has a below average level of market risk. During the past couple of weeks, WMT average daily volatility was 19.65%, which is -4.65 percentage points higher than the average volatility over the past 100 days.

(NYSE:WMT) from a hold rating to a buy rating in a report issued on Wednesday, October 18th. The firm currently has $96.00 price target on the retailer’s stock.  According to Zacks, “Share price of Walmart has outperformed the industry in the past one year, as the company is pushing itself to understand the evolving needs of its customers and expand itself in both brick-and-mortar space as well as e-commerce activities. On one hand, the company is posting positive comps at Walmart U.S. for 12 successive quarters; while on the other hand, it is also building its e-commerce capabilities through acquisitions and growing in the online grocery and delivery market. The company therefore expects sales to rise approximately 3% during fiscal 2019, backed by the sustained growth in comps and e-commerce. However, the company still faces headwinds such as unfavorable currency, stiff competition from both brick & mortar and online retailers and huge expenses related to e-commerce investments.

https://www.stocknewsgazette.com/2017/10/27/technical-analysis-hints-where-wal-mart-stores-inc-wmt-is-headed-in-next-few-days/

Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) gained 0.16% in yesterday’s session, going up from its prior closing price of $88.48 to $88.62, and has now recorded rally in 3 consecutive sessions. Many in the market will be closely watching whether this winning streak is sustainable or take a temporary pause for the next couple of trading sessions. The stock price went upward in 8 of the last 10 days and has generated 2.93% during the last two weeks. The upbeat movement of both volume and price during the recent session is interpreted as a good sign, and, overall 0.06 million more shares exchanged hands compared with prior day. In total, 6.42 M shares exchanged hands for about $569.18 million. Inside WMT’s Recent Trend Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) lies in the upper part of a wide and weak rising trend in the short term, and this will normally pose a very good selling opportunity for the short-term trader as reaction back towards the lower part of the trend can be expected. A break-up at the top trend line at $88.93 will firstly indicate a stronger raising rate. Short-term traders are predicted to see a rally of 7.15% over the course of a quarter and, with 90% chance the price will be floating in the range of $85.61 and $95.29 in this timeframe. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Technical Signals 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 WMT has witnessed its long term and short term MA triggering a buy signal. Many traders watch for short-term averages to cross above long-term averages to signal the beginning of a uptrend. Upon corrections, the price will meet support from the averages between $87.68 and $82.18. A break down through these support points will trigger sell signals. There was increase in both volume and price. This is usually interpreted as a good sign as traders widely believe rising stock should see increasing volume. Some other technical concerns emerged as well, putting in risk the future growth of the stock in the next couple of days. Its pivot point high generated sell signal on Monday October 23, 2017, which calls for additional declines until the stock forms a new pivot point low, as this could be a buying opportunity. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) Support And Resistance Levels In case of pullback, the next support the price will capture from accumulated volume will not be far away from current price at $84.13 and $80.53. In case of gains, the next resistance from accumulated volume will not be far away from today’s level at $88.65. 
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 It is important to note, however, that the stock needs to make its way through natural risk while testing a key support level. Once this support is broken, another support level will be to be established at a lower level. Turning back to this stock, Wal-Mart Stores Inc approaches the first support point just current price at $84.13. In case of a break, the next support we will see from accumulated volume is going to be at $80.53 and $78.34. Accumulated volume is going to prevent the price from rising further at $88.65 and this action will lead the price to take a temporary pause or stay muted for a few days. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) Risk Assessment A volatility based measure Bollinger Bands suggests this stock poses high risk. In the most recent session, the stock price hovered around $1.09 between high and low, or 1.24%.

A bearish opportunity I see in today’s market involves Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT). Wal-Mart seems to be trying to fight back against Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), but that’s difficult to do. Personally, I tried to buy something online from Wal-Mart, and it was very complicated compared to Amazon, which was almost automatic. And, like many people, I’m not going to spend a lot of time trying to do something when I don’t have to. It’s just a lot easier to work with Amazon than with Wal-Mart at this point. What’s more, WMT has a tendency to drop right at the beginning of the year. If you look at the chart, year after year that January drop usually occurs. Also, WMT really has had a huge gain this year, and I thought that it probably overdid it. With all that in mind, here is my recommendation for a put debit spread on WMT: Using a spread order, buy to open the WMT Jan. 19th $82.50 put and sell to open the WMT Jan. 19th $77.50 put for a net debit of about $0.90 to $0.95. Note: There are several January expirations available for WMT options. Be sure you are opening the monthly options that expire on Friday, Jan. 19, 2018. A debit spread is simply a way to lower the cost of buying options, as the option that you sell to open (short) helps offset the cost of the option that you buy to open. Therefore, this put debit spread is a way to lower the cost of buying bearish put options. Many brokers will require the use of margin and/or a set amount of reserved capital to execute a debit spread; contact your broker directly for specific requirements. Ken Trester is editor of the popular Maximum Options program. Trester has been trading options since the first exchanges opened in 1973 with a winning streak that goes back to 1984 with money-doubling average annual profits since 1990.

Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) shares are up more than 28.26% this year and recently increased 1.38% or $1.21 to settle at $88.65. Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), on the other hand, is down -13.36% year to date as of 10/23/2017. It currently trades at $62.58 and has returned 4.04% during the past week. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) are the two most active stocks in the Discount, Variety Stores industry based on today’s trading volumes. Investor interest in the two stocks is clearly very high, but which is the better investment? To answer this question, we will compare the two companies across growth, profitability, risk, and valuation metrics, and also examine their analyst ratings and insider activity trends. Growth Companies that can increase earnings at a high compound rate over time are attractive to investors. Analysts expect WMT to grow earnings at a 6.66% annual rate over the next 5 years. Comparatively, TGT is expected to grow at a -3.33% annual rate. All else equal, WMT’s higher growth rate would imply a greater potential for capital appreciation. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Profitability and Returns Growth doesn’t mean much if it comes at the cost of weak profitability. To adjust for differences in capital structure we’ll use EBITDA margin and Return on Investment (ROI) as measures of profitability and return. , compared to an EBITDA margin of 10.11% for Target Corporation (TGT). WMT’s ROI is 13.40% while TGT has a ROI of 15.50%. The interpretation is that TGT’s business generates a higher return on investment than WMT’s. Cash Flow  
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 The amount of free cash flow available to investors is ultimately what determines the value of a stock. WMT’s free cash flow (“FCF”) per share for the trailing twelve months was +0.66. Comparatively, TGT’s free cash flow per share was +1.04. On a percent-of-sales basis, WMT’s free cash flow was 0.41% while TGT converted 0.82% of its revenues into cash flow. This means that, for a given level of sales, TGT is able to generate more free cash flow for investors. Liquidity and Financial Risk Balance sheet risk is one of the biggest factors to consider before investing. WMT has a current ratio of 0.80 compared to 0.90 for TGT. This means that TGT can more easily cover its most immediate liabilities over the next twelve months. WMT’s debt-to-equity ratio is 0.62 versus a D/E of 1.10 for TGT. TGT is therefore the more solvent of the two companies, and has lower financial risk. Valuation WMT trades at a forward P/E of 19.16, a P/B of 3.49, and a P/S of 0.53, compared to a forward P/E of 14.21, a P/B of 3.10, and a P/S of 0.49 for TGT. WMT is the expensive of the two stocks on an earnings, book value and sales basis. Given that earnings are what matter most to investors, analysts tend to place a greater weight on the P/E. Analyst Price Targets and Opinions Investors often compare a stock’s current price to an analyst price target to get a sense of the potential upside within the next year. WMT is currently priced at a 1.97% to its one-year price target of 86.94. Comparatively, TGT is 5.57% relative to its price target of 59.28. This suggests that WMT is the better investment over the next year. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 2.40 for WMT and 3.00 for TGT, which implies that analysts are more bullish on the outlook for TGT. Risk and Volatility To gauge the market risk of a particular stock, investors use beta. Stocks with a beta above 1 are more volatile than the market as a whole. Conversely, a beta below 1 implies below average systematic risk. WMT has a beta of 0.33 and TGT’s beta is 0.63. WMT’s shares are therefore the less volatile of the two stocks. Insider Activity and Investor Sentiment Short interest is another tool that analysts use to gauge investor sentiment. It represents the percentage of a stock’s tradable shares that are being shorted. WMT has a short ratio of 5.03 compared to a short interest of 8.63 for TGT. This implies that the market is currently less bearish on the outlook for WMT. Summary Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) beats Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) on a total of 8 of the 14 factors compared between the two stocks. TGT is growing fastly, generates a higher return on investment, has higher cash flow per share, has a higher cash conversion rate and higher liquidity.

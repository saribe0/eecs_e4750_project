Everyone was looking forward to the new iPhone 8 and 8 Plus from Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). After introducing the two phones, AAPL unveiled the iPhone X. All of them are gorgeous devices, without a doubt. But not everyone is onboard with upgrading. I was like many others, holding onto an iPhone 6, waiting for something to really change my mind. I thought, if the 8 is amazing, I will get it. If it feels “meh” I’ll buy the 7 which will now be at a discount. While demand is “off the charts” for iPhone X so far, the 8 isn’t looking too hot. Like many others, I thought the 8 and X would lead to an iPhone super-cycle. It still probably will. But in the short-term, there could be some struggle. In the fiscal third quarter, the iPhone 8/8 Plus represented just 16% of sales, according to surveys. Consider that the 7/7 Plus represented 43% of sales in a similar period, while the 6/6 Plus stood at 46%. Because the iPhone X was not available, this could lead to a disappointment in sales, earnings and margins in the short-term. The jump from the 6 and 6S to the 7 was notable. But the improvements from the iPhone 7 to iPhone 8 aren’t, really. The 8’s processor is faster, supports (but does not come standard) with wireless charging and it has some cool photo software. But the battery life, camera quality, weight and size don’t really improve from the 7. Plus, a lot of people remain skeptical of the 8’s glass back as opposed to the metal backing of the 7. In all, why pay $699 for an iPhone 8 if you can get the very similar iPhone 7 for $549? Further, for a similar price to the iPhone 8, consumers can get the 7 Plus, or the 7 with more memory. Decluttr, a technology recycling site, has already noted a sharp increase in iPhone 8/8 Plus trade-ins. This is unusual, given that the device just came out. Admittedly though, Apple also doesn’t typically release a standard, plus and super model in the same cycle, either. It’s good news in that there is obvious pent-up demand for the more expensive iPhone X. It’s bad news in the sense that these consumers are finding that the iPhone 8 (apparently) wasn’t worth the purchase. While there are risks with the iPhone 8, the iPhone X looks promising. With a starting price target of $999 and obvious demand for the new device, Apple’s average selling price (ASP) should be elevated quite a bit. The risk here is that the iPhone 8/8 Plus is a dud, from a sales perspective, as consumers opt for either the iPhone X or the iPhone 7/7 Plus. Perhaps between the low-priced iPhone 7 and the high-priced iPhone X, these ASPs will still drift higher over time. In fact, they very well should move higher given that a $999 iPhone (starting price) has never been available.

At the start of each trading session, you will receive an email with the author's new posts. You won't receive any more email notifications from this author. AAPL is up 1.6% this morning, partly because of the larger tech rally, but mostly because pre-orders for its new iPhone X sold out within minutes of going on sale. Within 10 minutes of the launch, AAPL was telling customers that delivery would be delayed 3 weeks. The iPhone X is due out Nov. 3rd. It just so happens that AAPL earnings are due out the prior day, after the close on Thursday Nov. 2nd, which should mute any otherwise disappointing results. After all of the skepticism and criticism about the new iPhone 8 series, AAPL's stock price has been grinding higher for the past several sessions. As we speak, AAPL is pushing up against its Sep.-Oct. resistance line in the vicinity of 160, which if hurdled and sustained-- and triggers upside continuation above the 10/17 high at 160.87, will point AAPL towards a retest of its Sep, all-time high at 164.94-- in route to 170-172.  The less bullish scenario, if only a function of time, argues that AAPL will stall in and around 160, and thereafter pull back to 156-155 prior to next Thursday's earnings release, at which time a bullish reaction to the news will thrust AAPL out of a post-Sep. bullish coil pattern that also projects to 170-172. Last ahead of the open is 159.30/35.

Today AAPL: 163.05 

Ben Lovejoy

 
							- Oct. 30th 2017 5:37 am PT
								
@benlovejoy
 @benlovejoy Investors were clearly enthused by Apple’s statement that demand for the iPhone X was ‘off the charts,’ AAPL stock rising 3.58% on the news … 

(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
NordVPN Reuters reports that three Japanese firms have also enjoyed some of the benefit, share prices rising despite a weak financial market in the country. Japanese Apple suppliers outperformed, with TDK Corp gaining 0.7 percent and Foster Electric rising 1.1 percent, and Taiyo Yuden surging 0.9 percent. The gains might seem comparatively modest, but they are set against a backdrop of general Nikkei nervousness following underperforming banks and ‘caution ahead of major central bank meetings this week.’ It’s common for Apple suppliers to experience their own share gains on the back of positive Apple news. We saw the same thing back in August when the iPhone maker reported decent Q3 results and gave strong Q4 guidance. We have just a few days to go before we find out whether Apple’s fiscal Q4 (calendar Q3) lived up to expectations as the company reports its earnings on November 2.

 @benlovejoy Investors were clearly enthused by Apple’s statement that demand for the iPhone X was ‘off the charts,’ AAPL stock rising 3.58% on the news …

NordVPN Reuters reports that three Japanese firms have also enjoyed some of the benefit, share prices rising despite a weak financial market in the country. Japanese Apple suppliers outperformed, with TDK Corp gaining 0.7 percent and Foster Electric rising 1.1 percent, and Taiyo Yuden surging 0.9 percent. The gains might seem comparatively modest, but they are set against a backdrop of general Nikkei nervousness following underperforming banks and ‘caution ahead of major central bank meetings this week.’ It’s common for Apple suppliers to experience their own share gains on the back of positive Apple news.

Tech giant Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has seen its shares languish around the $155 mark for the past three months. Investors are questioning whether the company’s latest devices, the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, will be enough to keep the firm’s revenue on the upswing after a brief period of decline. The new iPhones have had a lukewarm reception, as many complain that they are too similar to the 7 models, and others hold out for the iPhone X due out in November. Apple stock’s loss of momentum provides an opportunity to buy, especially considering the fact that AAPL earnings are due out next week. While some are cautious ahead of the fourth quarter results, I think the results will send the stock higher, making now a great entry point. As I mentioned, Apple’s revenue is of utmost importance to investors, especially after the firm reported a revenue decline for the first time ever last year. Since then, Apple has been able to report revenue growth consistently, and this quarter is unlikely to be any different. Apple is expecting to report fourth quarter revenue to be somewhere between $49 billion and $52 billion. That means even if the figures come in at the low end, Apple will be able to report year-over-year growth from last year’s fourth quarter revenue of $46.9 billion. However, in the past, the company’s management has been notoriously conservative when it comes to AAPL earnings guidance, so I think it’s safe to assume that the revenue figures will come in on the higher end of the scale. Some worry about whether the lackluster reception of the iPhone 8 will hurt the firm’s revenue. That’s a valid concern considering that iPhone sales are the meat and potatoes of Apple’s overall revenue. It’s true that people appear to be holding out for the iPhone X, the sales of which won’t impact the fourth quarter results. But I’d imagine that management took this into account when they were making their forecasts. Another big catalyst for AAPL stock is the firm’s ability to continue growing from quarter to quarter. Next week’s AAPL earnings call will likely be dominated by questions about the company’s highly anticipated iPhone X and the projections for its holiday sales. With so many souped-up new features and very few rivals boasting similar capabilities, the iPhone X has a lot of potential to boost Apple’s sales during the holiday shopping season. As HSBC analyst Steven Pelayo pointed out when the bank gave AAPL stock a “Buy” rating, Apple has a lot of loyal customers who are likely waiting for the iPhone X to hit the shelves before they upgrade. That massively loyal customer base gives Apple a wide moat. The buzz around the iPhone X has made it a must-have for people who are dedicated to the Apple ecosystem.

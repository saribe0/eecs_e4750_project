The recent progress in the stock of Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) has alerted everyone to look out for right opportunity to invest. Many analysts use price trends and patterns to predict future performance, and we can glean some important insights about AMAT by examining the chart. How has the stock performed recently? Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) in the last month has increased +10.49%. Shares are now up over the past year, outperforming the broad market by -100% and outperformed a peer group of similar companies by 187%. After the latest session, which saw the stock close at a price of $55.93, AMAT sits below its 52-week high. Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) has been trading in a bullish manner, based on the relative positions of the stock’s 20 and 200 day moving averages. Momentum indicators 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that AMAT may be headed in the future. To do this, analysts often study the speed and magnitude of a stock’s price movements with what are known as momentum indicators. The logic is that as a stock’s momentum slows, it may be nearing key support or resistance levels and possibly the end of a current trend. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for AMAT is 71.07%, which suggests that the stock may be primed for a trend reversal or a corrective pullback in price. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 88.62%, tells a similar story, and suggests that AMAT currently trades in overbought territory. What do the trading volumes reveal? Volume patterns are useful for gauging the level of conviction behind price changes, and can be used to make predictions about future price movements. A sudden increase in a stock’s activity can be a sign that investors are trading in anticipation of a catalyst, or that investors feel very strongly in one way or the other about the future direction of a stock. Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT) average trading volume of 10,523,640 during the past month is 6.72% above its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been more active than usual in the stock in recent times.

In which a veteran of cultural studies seminars in the 1990s moves into academic administration and finds himself a married suburban father of two. Foucault, plus lawn care. The new IPEDS data: real progress, but more work needs to be done. Along with many other community college people, I’m glad to see that the National Center for Education Statistics is finally making some fundamental changes to its IPEDS numbers, which have painted an unduly negative picture of community colleges for decades. IPEDS (the Integrated Post-Secondary Education Data System) calculates a “headline” graduation rate based on the cohort of first-time, full-time, degree seeking students who graduate the institution at which they started within 150 percent of “normative” time. For a community college associate’s degree program, that means three years. Nationally, the average hovers in the low twenties, with some variation based on regional factors. (For example, regions with heavy concentrations of four-year colleges tend to have lower two-year college graduation rates, because more of the “honors” high school students take those other options. In states with sparser four-year options, the two-year colleges attract more of the high achievers.) Those low-sounding numbers give ammunition to a punitive “performance-based funding” movement, and serve to reinforce the stigma around open-admissions institutions. Which might be okay if they reflected reality, but they don’t. The NCES also tells us that nearly half of bachelor’s degree graduates in the US have significant numbers of community college credits. Squaring that number with a graduation rate in the low twenties suggests that the graduation rate is missing quite a bit.  And it is. The time limit is a poor fit for many student populations with particular needs, such as English-language learners.  They often take longer than three years to finish because they’re learning the English language as they go.  That’s an impressive feat, and one worthy of support, but the new immigrant who graduates in four or five years, gets a job, pays taxes, and supports a family shows up in our numbers as a dropout. The existing rate misses part-time students, students who are returning to college with credits from previous forays, and -- remarkably -- students who leave a community college prior to graduation but complete a bachelor’s degree “on time.” We have a lot of those. They come to community college to get some momentum, and possibly to prove to themselves or their parents that they’re academically capable and serious; once they have some momentum, they move on. I like to use theological language to describe them. They treat community college as purgatory, where they cleanse themselves of sin before moving on to the promised land. By any reasonable measure, both those students and the community colleges that serve them have succeeded; by the old IPEDS measure, though, they count as dropouts.   Part of that is due to an ambiguity in the term “degree-seeking.” “Degree-seeking” doesn’t necessarily mean “degree-seeking here.” For a student who starts at a community college to save money and/or overcome a shaky high school record, but who really doesn’t care about picking up an associate’s degree on the way to a bachelor’s, the IPEDS measure is a terrible fit.  It picks up far too many false negatives. The student who does a year at Brookdale before transferring to Rutgers, where she graduates on time, shows up in our numbers as a dropout.  She lowers our graduation rate, despite successfully completing a bachelor’s in four years. Substantively, that’s absurd. We’ve developed some homegrown measures that include early transfer, such as the Voluntary Framework of Accountability. But even there, we can’t always capture transfers across state lines. For smallish states in densely populated regions, that’s a major issue; we send plenty of students to New York City, Philadelphia, and other areas, but they show up as dropouts. I’d make a distinction between transferring early to Temple and dropping out, but the Feds don’t. The same applies to post-graduation wage data. Many of the jobs in NYC or Philly pay more than jobs locally, but only the local ones show up in our data. That leads to figures lower than reality. Most of this would be inside baseball among sociologists if it didn’t impact our funding and public image. But it does. A measure that makes reasonable sense for a residential college that only admits academically strong students who can attend full-time is a lousy fit for us. The new-and-improved version still has some key gaps -- transfers across state lines still show up as dropouts, rendering false negatives for small states -- but it looks at more students. That’s a start.   In my perfect world, we’d have accurate data that we’d use for improvement, rather than punishment or stigma. We’d recognize that students stopping out to work for a while isn’t necessarily a sign of institutional failure; if anything, the ability to offer second chances is a feature, not a bug. Heck, while we’re at it, we’d have parity in per-student funding with four-year colleges and universities, and maybe some policies based on the students we actually have.  But for now, some recognition that the complaints we’ve been lodging for decades are largely correct is a welcome start. I’ll take it. jump to comments Be the first to know.Get our free daily newsletter.

By JENNIFER SCHUESSLEROCT. 30, 2017
 The history of literary criticism is filled with would-be revolutionaries. But few have issued as radical a cry as Franco Moretti, the professor famous for urging his colleagues to stop reading books. Most literary criticism is grounded in close reading, with scholars poring over individual texts to tease out subtle meanings. But to truly grasp the laws of literature, Mr. Moretti has argued in a series of polemics, requires “distant reading”: the computer-assisted crunching of thousands of texts at a time. It’s a pie-in-the-sky idea, perhaps, but one that Mr. Moretti has put into practice. Since 2010, Stanford Literary Lab, which he founded with Matthew Jockers, has issued a string of pamphlets chronicling its research into topics ranging from loudness in the 19th-century novel to the evolving language of World Bank reports. [Read about some of the Stanford Literary Lab’s findings.] A dozen of the pamphlets have now been collected in “Canon/Archive,” out next week from n+1 Books. The publication provides something of a retrospective occasion for Mr. Moretti, 67, who retired last spring from Stanford. But it also prompts a larger question at a time when the broader field of digital humanities is booming: What has the Big Data approach to literature added up to? Advertisement It’s a question that draws heated answers. Digital humanities has been accused of fetishizing science, of acting as a Trojan horse for the corporate forces threatening the university, and worse. A recent broadside in The Chronicle of Higher Education called “The Digital-Humanities Bust” took a bludgeon to the field’s revolutionary rhetoric, with Mr. Moretti among those accused of issuing a stream of vague “promissory notes” for results that never arrive. Mr. Moretti — who prefers to call the lab’s work “computational criticism” — tends to greet such challenges with a mixture of modesty and bravado. “Our results are not as good as what I had hoped for 10 or 15 years ago,” he said in an interview earlier this month, during a brief trip to New York. “We have not yet created a revolution in knowledge. But how much of literary scholarship is even trying to do that?” Mr. Moretti, who was born to teacher parents in a small town in northern Italy (his brother is the filmmaker Nanni Moretti), represents something of a paradox. He’s an intellectual trained in the grand European tradition who questions its most cherished methods. And he’s a professor who has achieved some measure of celebrity by promoting a ruthlessly impersonal idea of both scholarship and literary history itself. Literary criticism typically tends to emphasize the singularity of exceptional works that have stood the test of time. But the canon, Mr. Moretti argues, is a distorted sample. Instead, he says, scholars need to consider the tens of thousands of books that have been forgotten, a task that computer algorithms and enormous digitized databases have now made possible. Advertisement “We know how to read texts,” he wrote in a much-quoted essay included in his book “Distant Reading,” which won the 2014 National Book Critics Circle Award for Criticism. “Now let’s learn how to not read them.” These days, Mr. Moretti has softened his rhetoric, though the underlying point is the same. “Reading is one of life’s greatest pleasures,” which we “would be insane” to give up, he said. “But the question is whether reading and knowledge are continuous with each other.” Mr. Moretti’s own output has a similar dividedness. His early work was grounded in close reading, and his last book “The Bourgeois: Between Literature and History,” included fine-grained analysis of classic works. That his digital provocations command wide interest even among highly skeptical colleagues may owe something to what Leah Price, professor of English at Harvard, called a “Nixon in China” effect. “Only because his own close readings are so dazzling, does Moretti have the credibility to say: Read as closely as you want, but if you want to understand literary history you’ll need other tools,” she said.

The literary quality of the lab’s pamphlets, which are usually credited to teams of researchers, also doesn’t hurt. Yes, they bristle with bar charts, scatterplot diagrams and sometimes eyeball-blistering terminology. (“‘Operationalizing’ must be the ugliest word I’ve ever used,” Mr. Moretti writes in the first sentence of a solo-authored pamphlet called… “Operationalizing.”) But they are also full of witty asides and suspenseful first-person narration that acknowledges surprises, dead-ends and the collaborative, experimental nature of the lab’s work. “They’re very good at dramatizing the method,” said Ted Underwood, a professor at the University of Illinois who also uses computational analysis. “That’s part of the fun of reading them.” Some of the lab’s results may seem less than earthshaking. For example, it turns out that what distinguishes the Gothic novel isn’t just castles and ghosts, but more frequent use of the certain verb tenses and prepositions. (The critic Kathryn Schulz, writing about some of the early pamphlets in The New York Times Book Review in 2011, said she “mostly vacillated between two reactions: ‘Huh?’ and ‘Duh!’”) Advertisement But even modest-seeming results — like the finding that from 1785 to 1900 the language of the British novel steadily shifted away from words relating to moral judgment to words associated with concrete description — unsettle established ideas of literary history. “We tend to see literary history as a story of movements, periods, sudden revolutions,” Mr. Underwood said. “There also these really broad, slow, massive changes that we haven’t described before.” Some of the lab’s findings have themselves had sudden, and totally unexpected, real-world results. Mr. Moretti noted with amusement a flap last spring at the World Bank, where Paul Romer, the chief economist, was relieved of some management duties at its research arm after demanding, among other changes, that its publications reduce their use of the word “and” — one of the stylistic tics mocked in “Bankspeak,” a Lit Lab pamphlet analyzing the bank’s drift over 60 years toward more abstract and “self-referential” language. “How many literary critics can say they got the chief economist of the World Bank, O.K., not fired, but deprived of some of his power?” Mr. Moretti said with a laugh. Since retiring from Stanford, Mr. Moretti has moved to Lausanne, Switzerland, where he is helping to create a new digital humanities program at the country’s leading polytechnic. He also has a full slate of writing projects, including a study of forgotten 19th-century British best-sellers and an algorithm-free book based on his undergraduate lectures on American culture, to be published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux. Even if the results of computational criticism never catch up with his early polemical fervor, Mr. Moretti remains unapologetic about trying. “I’d rather be a failed revolutionary,” he said, “than someone who never tried to do a revolution in the first place.” Follow on Twitter: @jennyschuessler We’re interested in your feedback on this page.

The congressional itch to "do something" on cybersecurity is especially pronounced after the Equifax breach, but whether lawmakers will go large, small or not at all is decidedly unclear. Equifax affected so many consumers that lawmakers from both parties seem more determined than usual to make something happen on consumer data security and breach notification legislation that has stalled over multiple Congresses. "Equifax may well be the tipping point that leads to action that can get through one or both chambers," said the Financial Services Roundtable's Jason Kratovil. "That is the hope." FSR and the Retail Industry Leaders Association, among others, have been on the front lines of a push for a national breach notification standard — in place of a patchwork of 48 state standards — although the two groups frequently have clashed over the details. In the House, Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, and financial institutions subcommittee Chairman Blaine Luetkemeyer, R-Mo., have been meeting with stakeholders on possible data-breach legislation. Committee member Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., has introduced a targeted bill that deals specifically with cybersecurity and other issues at consumer credit rating agencies such as Equifax. McHenry is hoping to get a hearing on the proposal in the coming weeks, according to an aide to the lawmaker. Lobbyists from different industries said the McHenry bill could move before the committee takes on a larger breach notification measure, which would check the post-Equifax "do-something" box, or it could be folded into a larger effort. Hensarling hasn't appeared to be in a rush to move legislation, although he and Luetkemeyer both promised to revisit, and perhaps revise, data-breach legislation the committee passed last session. "The majority is being tentative on this bill, this time around," said one private-sector source closely following the issue. "There are more traps than usual for the committee on this." But a little healthy competition between committees might put the legislative effort on a faster track. The House Energy and Commerce Committee has announced its own follow-up hearing for this Wednesday on "Securing Consumers' Credit Data in the Age of Digital Commerce," at the digital commerce and consumer protection subcommittee. Energy and Commerce Chairman Greg Walden, R-Ore., and subcommittee Chairman Bob Latta, R-Ohio, both have been skeptical about data-breach legislation, but they may be even more wary of allowing the Financial Services Committee to get ahead with its own version of a bill. The Financial Services panel announced it will have a subcommittee hearing the same day on consumer data vulnerabilities. Both committees passed data-breach bills in the last Congress and were unable to iron out their differences, which prevented any measure from reaching the floor. It's not clear if that dynamic persists, and the two panels still seem to be circling one another on the issue. "We don't expect serious discussions of what should be in a bill at these hearings," said FSR's Kratovil. "But Equifax is an opportunity for the two committees to find common ground and unite." In the Senate, the GOP leaders of the Banking, Commerce and Judiciary committees aren't revealing any plans yet for next steps, either on breach notification in general or on credit rating agencies in particular. Senators from both parties this week pointed to a bipartisan Senate working group on the breach-notification issue. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., has been leading discussions among senators in that group, but congressional and other sources said an actual legislative product isn't imminent. "They are relooking at all their past work through a post-Equifax lens," said one industry source. The Senate leadership, like that in the House, will be looking to see whether lawmakers can get over their jurisdictional and substantive differences this time before committing floor time to legislation. That will be the test for whether intense interest in"doing something" actually translates into a new national approach to data security and consumer notification of breaches — after 145 million Americans learned their most sensitive financial data was now for sale on the digital black market. Charlie Mitchell is editor of InsideCybersecurity.com, an exclusive service coveringcybersecurity policy from Inside Washington Publishers, and author of "Hacked: The InsideStory of America's Struggle to Secure Cyberspace," published by Rowman and Littlefield.

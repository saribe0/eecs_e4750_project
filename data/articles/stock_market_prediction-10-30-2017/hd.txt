Stocks in Europe were mixed and the euro gained as investors await the next development in Spain’s Catalan crisis. Treasuries and the dollar were steady before the Federal Reserve’s policy meeting this week, which comes as President Donald Trump prepares to name the central bank’s next chairman. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index nudged lower as a drop in mining shares offset gains for technology and telecommunications stocks. Markets showed little sign of unease as the government in Madrid began the process of reasserting control after Catalonia’s declaration of independence, with Spanish stocks outperforming and the country’s bonds gaining. Debt of other peripheral nations also climbed after S&P Global ratings upgraded Italy’s credit on Friday. WTI crude rose to a six-month high as Saudi Arabia’s crown prince backed extended output cuts by OPEC. Profit reports due this week from some of the world’s largest companies may show if there’s enough juice in the earnings season to propel leg higher for global shares. Speculation continues around who U.S. President Donald Trump will choose as the next Fed chair, with Governor Jerome Powell said to be the front-runner. Elsewhere, equity benchmarks fluctuated in Japan, while Chinese shares fell, with the Shanghai Composite Index tumbling the most in more than two months as the nation’s bond slump deepened amid mounting deleveraging concerns. The slide in Chinese stocks came after a period of calm through the recent Communist Party Congress, as sovereign bonds extended a monthly rout amid concern the government will step up efforts to reduce leverage in the financial sector. Early signs are also surfacing that economic data may weaken, after solid figures for most of this year buoyed equities. That largely overshadowed gains on Wall Street on Friday after U.S. gross domestic product added to evidence of an improving global economy. (Source: Bloomberg) Top Pick for Monday: The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE: HD) The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE: HD) has grabbed attention from the analysts when it experienced a change of -0.18% in the last trading session to close at $167.34. A total of 3,717,700 shares exchanged hands during the intra-day trade contrast with its average trading volume of 4.61M shares, while its relative volume stands at 0.81. Relative volume is the comparison of current volume to average volume for the same time of day, and it’s displayed as a ratio. If RVOL is less than 1 it is not In Play on this trading day and Investors may decide not to trade it.  If RVOL is above 2 it is In Play and this is more evidence Investors ought to be in the name.  When stocks are *very* In Play one can see a RVOL of 5 and above.  The higher the RVOL the more In Play the stock is. Day traders strive to make money by exploiting minute price movements in individual assets (usually stocks, though currencies, futures, and options are traded as well), usually leveraging large amounts of capital to do so, therefore they trade on Stocks in Play. In Play Stocks are volatile enough to produce good risk and reward trading opportunities for both bull and bear traders intraday. Most company stocks have very little volatility. They generally move extremely slowly and they only produce big price swings when the company produces good or bad trading results, which may only happen a couple of times a year at best. In deciding what to focus on – in a stock, say – a typical day trader looks for three things: liquidity, volatility and trading volume. Liquidity allows an investor to enter and exit a stock at a good price (i.e. tight spreads, or the difference between the bid and ask price of a stock, and low slippage, or the difference between the predictable price of a trade and the actual price). If a stock does not have good liquidity then it may take some time before a broker is able to negotiate a deal to buy or sell a stock and the broker may not be able to get the sell or buy price that the trader is looking for. This is a problem for day traders and it could mean the difference between a profitable and non-profitable trade. Traders have different rules for what constitutes liquidity and a good guide is the volume of trades and volume of shares that are traded each day. 100,000 shares traded per day would be a minimum for most traders and some require 1,000,000. Trading volume is a gauge of how many times a stock is bought and sold in a given time period (most commonly, within a day of trading, known as the average daily trading volume – ADTV). A high degree of volume indicates a lot of interest in a stock. Often, a boost in the volume of a stock is a harbinger of a price jump, either up or down. Volatility is simply a measure of the predictable daily price range—the range in which a day trader operates. More volatility means greater profit or loss. After a recent check, The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE: HD) stock is found to be 1.09% volatile for the week, while 0.92% volatility is recorded for the month. Technical’s Snapshot: The stock has a market cap of $197.63B and the number of outstanding shares has been calculated 1.18B. Based on a recent bid, its distance from 20 days simple moving average is 1.50%, and its distance from 50 days simple moving average is 5.18% while it has a distance of 10.43% from the 200 days simple moving average. The company’s distance from 52-week high price is -0.36% and the current price is 40.39% away from 52-week low price. The company has Relative Strength Index (RSI 14) of 75.34 together with Average True Range (ATR 14) of 1.57. Stock’s Valuation: Past 5 years growth of HD observed at 21.10%, and for the next five years the analysts that follow this company is expecting its growth at 12.57%. The stock’s price to sales ratio for trailing twelve months is 2.03 and price to book ratio for the most recent quarter is 55.78, whereas price to cash per share for the most recent quarter are 40.92. Its quick ratio for the most recent quarter is 0.50. Analysts mean recommendation for the stock is 1.90.

Consistently, one of the more popular stocks people enter into their stock options watchlist  at Stock Options Channel is Home Depot Inc (Symbol: HD). So this week we highlight one interesting put contract, and one interesting call contract, from the September 2018 expiration for HD. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting, is at the $140 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $3.50. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 2.5% return against the $140 commitment, or a 2.7% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost  ).      Selling a put does not give an investor access to HD's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. So unless Home Depot Inc sees its shares fall 15.6% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $136.50 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $3.50 from $140), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 2.7% annualized rate of return.  makeArticleAd();  Worth considering, is that the annualized 2.7% figure actually exceeds the 2.1% annualized dividend paid by Home Depot Inc, based on the current share price of $165.81. And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to lose 15.62% to reach the $140 strike price.    Always important when discussing dividends is the fact that, in general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Home Depot Inc, looking at the dividend history chart for HD below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 2.1% annualized dividend yield.    Turning to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the September 2018 expiration, for shareholders of Home Depot Inc (Symbol: HD) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 2.1% annualized dividend yield. Selling the covered call at the $175 strike and collecting the premium based on the $6.75 bid, annualizes to an additional 4.5% rate of return against the current stock price (this is what we at Stock Options Channel refer to as the YieldBoost  ), for a total of 6.6% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $175 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but HD shares would have to advance 5.5% from current levels for that to happen, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 9.6% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.    The chart below shows the trailing twelve month trading history for Home Depot Inc, highlighting in green where the $140 strike is located relative to that history, and highlighting the $175 strike in red:       The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the September 2018 put or call options highlighted in this article deliver a rate of return that represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Home Depot Inc (considering the last 252 trading day HD historical stock prices  using closing values, as well as today's price of $165.81) to be 14%.

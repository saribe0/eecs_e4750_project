With that said, investors can't just pick stocks at random and hope they turn into the next Amazon AMZN  . What they can do, however, is look for companies that currently present the possibility for hefty gains based on real growth opportunities within a business. Based on these criteria, growth-minded investors might think about taking a long look at Netflix. Last quarter, Netflix revenues jumped 33% in its all-important streaming sector. On top of that, the video-streaming powerhouse added 5.3 million subscribers-pushing the company's total to 109.3 million worldwide. The company projects that it will add another 6.3 million subscriptions this quarter. Netflix also announced plans to spend up to $8 billion on content in 2018. Looking ahead, Netflix's revenues are projected to climb over 32% next quarter, based on our current consensus estimates. The company's full-year revenues are also expected to leap around 30% to hit an upward estimate of $11.72 billion. Netflix is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and also sports an "A" for Momentum in our Style Scores system.

https://www.stocknewsgazette.com/2017/10/27/heres-a-quick-technical-analysis-of-netflix-inc-nflx/

Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) gained 0.74% in yesterday’s session, going up from its prior closing price of $193.77 to $195.21. The price has fallen in 6 of the last 10 days and is down by -0.33% over the same course of time. Trading activity decreased by -0.13 million shares, and in total, 5.15 M shares exchanged hands for about $1 006.20 million. It should be noted that increasing price and decreasing volume show lack of interest and this is a warning that something has fundamentally changed. Inside NFLX’s Recent Trend Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) lies in the middle of a wide and strong rising trend in the short term and issued considerable signs about additional rally. Short-term traders are predicted to see a rally of 13.85% over the course of a quarter and, with 90% chance the price will be floating in the range of $208.10 and $234.31 in this timeframe. Netflix, Inc. Technical Signals 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 NFLX has witnessed its long term and short term MA triggering a buy signal. Many traders watch for short-term averages to cross above long-term averages to signal the beginning of a uptrend. Upon corrections, the price will meet support from the averages between $194.61 and $188.73. A break down through these support points will trigger sell signals. There was a decrease in volume but the price rose. This is usually not interpreted as a good sign as traders widely believe falling volume should see declining stock. Investors should be watching the price action like a hawk in the coming sessions. Some other technical concerns emerged as well, putting in risk the future growth of the stock in the next couple of days. Its pivot point high generated sell signal on Tuesday October 24, 2017, which calls for additional declines until the stock forms a new pivot point low, as this could be a buying opportunity. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) Support And Resistance Levels Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) recorded volume accumulation so there will probably be a surplus of buyers at $194.39. In case of gains, the next resistance from accumulated volume will not be far away from today’s level at $198.02, $199.48 and $202.68. 
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Accumulated volume is going to prevent the price from rising further at $198.02 and this action will lead the price to take a temporary pause or stay muted for a few days. Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) Risk Assessment A volatility based measure Bollinger Bands suggests this stock poses high risk. In the most recent session, the stock price hovered around $3.53 between high and low, or 1.82%. The average volatility for the past week stood at 2.01%.

https://investorplace.com/2017/10/netflix-inc-stock-investors-are-having-a-deja-vu-moment-with-price-hikes/

Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has everyone speculating over what higher prices mean for the NFLX stock price and profits. The last time NFLX tried to raise prices, it was nothing short of a disaster: customers leaving en masse, more than $11 billion chopped from the market value. Sounds like something for the horror movie genre. Though this took place what may seem like a distant five years ago before shares had started their skyrocketing, in the minds of management, the event no doubt still looms large in their minds. Deja vu, all over again. It’s a reminder that customers can demonstrate remarkable price sensitivity even if your product is differentiated and seemingly better than the other options out there. It’s also a reminder that even the top competitor in the internet streaming and video-on-demand space have to keep their eye on the prize. One blink, one misstep could send investors fleeing. No one in the C-Suite has forgotten when Netflix lost 800,000 U.S. subscribers during the quarter that announced the price hike and the DVD business spinning off into Qwikster, which ultimately failed. One of the major differences this time around is the nature of the Netflix content library. It’s certainly smaller, having let licensing deals with the likes of the Epix cable network and Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) expire, though with the latter not 100% of content will be taken off NFLX’s platform. That recent announcement of the sun setting on the DIS arrangement in 2019, sent some nervous ripples through the market, but the stock has continued to charge on up. Notably, shows like Narcos, Orange is the New Black, and House of Cards have propelled Netflix into the realms normally reserved for Hollywood studios. Back then, NFLX wasn’t the studio-esque force it is today, reaping Golden Globes and Emmy nominations. So while I don’t discount the value in a disruptor, I have to keep in mind that the market’s eye is always on the money. NFLX may be spending less on licensing rights — which don’t come cheap, especially for popular titles — by going the original programming route, but in turn, they have to spend billions on productions. That’s cash out the door with no clear return, as it can be a very hit-or-miss system.  Source: Statista As a result, it’s hard to model where they end up, spending at current prodigious rates. Sure, the growth profile looks good but the sustainability of it all is still in question, especially when domestic saturation seems nigh.

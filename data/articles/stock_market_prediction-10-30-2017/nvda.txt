NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) continues its red-hot performance. NVDA stock is one of the biggest winners on the NASDAQ for 2017. Shares are up 171% over the past year, and 83% 2017 year-to-date alone. Anyone skeptical of NVDA stock, including this author on occasion, has looked rather foolish. However, stock price isn’t always tied to business performance. In the case of NVDA stock, investors have bid it up far in excess of any reasonable valuation given the current balance of risk and reward. For NVDA stock to continue producing sizzling returns, just about everything has to go right for the company. The phrase “priced for perfection” was invented for situations like the one we see with Nvidia today. The story with NVDA stock starts at its frenetic earnings growth in recent quarters. Bulls can point to NVDA earnings with pride, it’s been one of the best stories of the year so far. The company has grown earnings by a rather astounding 137% over the past year. For the first half of 2017, compared to 2016, revenue climbed 53%, free cash flow generation by 17%, and net income by 125%. Those are amazing numbers, though net income and earnings are clearly running ahead of actual sales and cash flow, powered by improving margins and mix. All five of Nvidia’s product categories showed year-over-year growth. Only professional visualization came in under 10% growth; the other four segments all grew by at least 20%. Assuming full-year 2017 estimates are achieved, auto revenues will be up almost 5x since 2014, data center up 4x, and gaming up almost 3x. That’s some pretty heady stuff. Unfortunately, Nvidia’s growth rate is set for a serious slowdown. Analyst consensus has earnings rising from 3.49 over the past 12 months to just 4.02 next year. The company is heading for less than 20% growth next year, and analysts peg the five-year compounded growth rate going forward at just 13%. That’d put earnings in 2022 around seven bucks a share, which is nowhere near enough to justify a $200 stock price today. Sure, you can say, analysts are probably sandbagging. Nvidia tends to beat guidance when reporting quarterly results. But even assuming they beat guidance comfortably, it’s still hard to justify anything close to the current price. Given the relatively slow rate of EPS growth for the current year, the PE ratio will barely budge. NVDA stock is at 56x PE now and is expected to fall to just 49x in 2018. Why is earnings growth slowing down so dramatically? Here’s some real NVDA news that many folks tend to gloss over. It’s worth remembering that Nvidia generates close to 70% of its revenues from gaming and professional visualization. The gaming division has benefited from the launch of a bunch of new cards. That pulled forward demand, but don’t expect that sales momentum to continue let alone accelerate. And Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) will almost certainly hit back with new graphics cards launches of their own to try to take back share from Nvidia. Nvidia has also profited from card sales due to the boom in Bitcoin, Ethereum and other such cryptocurrencies. However, logic dictates these markets will slow down sooner or later. Already, as part of AMD’s earnings miss recently, they conceded that mining card demand is “leveling off.” That as cryptocoins continue to soar. What happens to this source of demand once Bitcoin prices stall out, let alone correct sharply?

On Wednesday, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) fell 13.5% despite beating earnings and revenue expectations. The company said revenue will decline sequentially by 12% to 18%. However, management boosted its full-year sales estimates. Still, shares were hammered. Could the same thing happen to NVDA stock when Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) reports fiscal third-quarter 2018 earnings on Nov. 11? Source: Shutterstock Plenty of investors have been looking at NVDA stock price today for clues as to what it might do. On Wednesday, it fell 2.5% in sympathy to AMD after previously nearing its 52-week high just under $200 a share. The big question is, what will it do leading to up and after NVDA earnings? The NVDA news has been good. Business demand remains robust. It’s well positioned in every meaningful tech growth market, including self-driving cars, artificial intelligence (AI), data-centers, cloud-computing, and graphic cards used in gaming and cryptocurrencies. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips All of that growth has put an immense valuation on Nvidia, with NVDA stock trading at 48 times forward earnings estimates. It may be forecast to grow 41% this year, but that growth slows to just 10.7% next year (fiscal 2019). Perhaps this forecast is too low. Even if we were to double it to 21%, I would still fold on a stock trading at 48 times earnings. Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB), Alibaba Holding Group Ltd (NYSE:BABA) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) actually have better growth rates and trade at roughly half the premium. So why pay up so much for NVDA, which notably, also trades at 14x sales? We all know self-driving cars, AI, and cloud storage will be highly relevant in the years to come. We don’t know who will win those wars — be it the battle between Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) and General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), or the cloud war between Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). However, we know that no matter which company or companies win, the one constant helping to power it all will be Nvidia. That’s why investors feel comfortable bidding up the stock to unimaginable heights. That’s why shares are up more than 80% in 2017, 170% in the past 12 months and 580% over the past two years. Does NVDA stock price today justify its future realities? It does, but it also limits how much upside could be left. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) has a market cap of $190 billion. NVDA stock is up to a $116 billion valuation. But despite having 61% of the market cap as INTC, NVDA’s sales are just one-seventh (~14.4%) the size. I definitely like Nvidia. Many have made the case it can go to $250. Longer term, I definitely don’t disagree. We know Nvidia is and will remain a powerhouse, but finding the right risk/reward balance is key.   Nvidia has beat earnings and revenue expectations in eight straight quarters. In 2016, each report led to another explosive rally. So far in 2017 though, those explosions are toning down. Only once did NVDA stock pop big, in May, after months of consolidation and it being slightly lower through five months of the year. Other than that, we’ve had near-flat reactions in February and August post-earnings. More and more investors have been pricing in good results, bidding the stock up into the report and leaving little upside left when Nvidia reports good results.  Click to Enlarge That seems to be happening now. NVDA stock is up 12% since its last report and keeps bumping into $200. So will NVDA plunge like AMD after earnings? If it sells off beforehand, I don’t think so. But if it rallies into the event, there could be issues moving higher in the short-term. I think the best thing that can happen is that AMD’s results weigh on NVDA. Intel will report on Oct. 26. A “so-so” reaction to this overbought name could weigh on Nvidia, too. That might be for the best, though. If we can get Nvidia down into the $175 to $185 range ahead of its own report, it will leave it with some ability to power higher on good results. For traders, $180 to $190 should act as support. For long-term investors looking to buy though, we have to wait. A market-wide pullback will eventually come to fruition. We’ve now had the longest streak ever in the S&P 500 without a 3% pullback. Eventually it will come and high-octane stocks like NVDA will get hit. Pounce when that happens.

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) gained 1.05% in yesterday’s session, going up from its prior closing price of $193.66 to $195.69. The price has been moving in both directions for this period, and there has been a 2.44% gain over 10-day period. Trading activity decreased by -12.69 million shares, and in total, 7.97 M shares exchanged hands for about $1 560.17 million. It should be noted that increasing price and decreasing volume show lack of interest and this is a warning that something has fundamentally changed. Inside NVDA’s Recent Trend NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) lies in the middle of a wide and strong rising trend in the short term and issued considerable signs about additional rally. Short-term traders are predicted to see a rally of 21.57% over the course of a quarter and, with 90% chance the price will be floating in the range of $222.45 and $248.85 in this timeframe. NVIDIA Corporation Technical Signals 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 NVDA has witnessed its short term MA triggering a sell signal. Meanwhile, however, the long-term average has generated a buy signal. When the short-run moving average rises above its longer-term trend, a buy signal is created. This is because a short-run moving average that crosses its long-run moving average counterpart is seen as the initiation of an upward trend. On additional rally, the share price will meet short term resistance at around $196.70. On a drop, the stock is likely to find some support over the long run, which begins at $184.01. A buy signal will be generated if it crosses above the short term moving average. Meanwhile, however, a price crossing below the long term moving average will generate a sell signal. Its pivot point low generated buy signal on Wednesday October 25, 2017, which calls for additional surge until the stock forms a new pivot point high. There was a decrease in volume but the price rose. This is usually not interpreted as a good sign as traders widely believe falling volume should see declining stock. Investors should be watching the price action like a hawk in the coming sessions. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Support And Resistance Levels NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) recorded volume accumulation so there will probably be a surplus of buyers at $187.55. In case of gains, the next resistance from accumulated volume will not be far away from today’s level at $197.58, $197.80 and $197.93. 
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Accumulated volume is going to prevent the price from rising further at $197.58 and this action will lead the price to take a temporary pause or stay muted for a few days. NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Risk Assessment A volatility based measure Bollinger Bands suggests this stock poses high risk. In the most recent session, the stock price hovered around $2.35 between high and low, or 1.21%. The average volatility for the past week stood at 1.99%.

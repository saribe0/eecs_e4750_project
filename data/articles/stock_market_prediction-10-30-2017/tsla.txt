  Tesla is falling after the Economic Daily News out of Taiwan reported that the company has cut production orders at one of its Model 3 parts suppliers. Tesla shares are down 1.85% at $320.37 a piece after the company reportedly cut orders at Hota, a manufacturer of gears and axles, by 40%. The carmaker temporarily cut its order from 5,000 sets per week to 3,000 sets per week. Tesla cut the size of its orders due to production bottlenecks with the Model 3, according to the report. The company has faced problems getting its first mass-marketed vehicles out the door and has fallen short of its  production expectations for the year. By 2018, Tesla had said it wanted to be making 20,000 Model 3s a month but has only managed to make several hundred in total so far. Tesla is working to resolve the bottlenecks and decided to push its new semi-truck announcement back to focus on the Model 3, which CEO Elon Musk has said is going through "production hell."  Tesla has about 450,000 back orders for the Model 3. The company reports its third-quarter earnings on November 1. Tesla shares are up 49.23% this year. Markets Insider NOW WATCH: Is bitcoin a bubble or the future of everything?

In June, I discussed the reasons why I thought Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) could hit $1,000. At the time, TSLA stock was trading around $360. Since then it’s taken a small step backward.  I gave what I thought was an honest analysis of what has to go right for TSLA to hit one million vehicles produced annually by 2020; should the company do that, hitting $1,000 is anything but impossible—but it has to get to a million.  Nearing the end of October, Tesla’s got 38 months to hit that production number. To hit $1,000, TSLA stock has to grow at 43% compounded annually over the next three years; a 48% return in 2018 would get it to $500. A 48% decline would drag it down to $176, but I’ve rounded it up to $200 for simplicity’s sake. Which does TSLA stock hit in 2018? $200 or $500? The heavy hitter wrote a very unflattering letter to clients Oct. 24 about Tesla. Of course, what’s Einhorn going to say when he’s got a significant short position in the company’s stock. In August I acknowledged Einhorn’s short, concluding my article by suggesting that Tesla’s stock would be overvalued if it doesn’t hit monthly production of 20,000 Model 3s by the end of the year. “The Wall Street Journal reported that the much-hyped Model 3 was indeed in production — by hand,” wrote InvestorPlace’s Lawrence Meyers discussing Tesla’s instance valuation recently. “Another source even says that the Model 3 is still being developed. Wasn’t this the car Musk said would be delivered in 2016?” That doesn’t sound like a company ready to produce 20,000 vehicles per anytime soon, does it? Einhorn certainly doesn’t think so. “Given the performance of certain stocks, we wonder if the market has adopted an alternative paradigm for calculating equity value,” wrote Einhorn in his letter to clients. “What if equity value has nothing to do with current or future profits and instead is derived from a company’s ability to be disruptive…?” That describes Tesla to a tee.  Unfortunately, David, the value placed on any stock is merely a number both the buyer and seller can agree to. One man’s gold is another man’s garbage; Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, yadda, yadda, yadda.    Bottom line: Einhorn might be right that TSLA stock isn’t worth the paper it’s written on but until a majority of investors come to this conclusion, TSLA will continue to trend higher.

Legendary investor Warren Buffett advises to be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful. One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.    In trading on Friday, shares of Tesla Inc (Symbol: TSLA) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 29.7, after changing hands as low as $316.66 per share. By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF ( SPY  ) is 70.1.

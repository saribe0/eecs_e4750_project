According to Zacks, “Share price of Walmart has outperformed the industry in the past one year, as the company is pushing itself to understand the evolving needs of its customers and expand itself in both brick-and-mortar space as well as e-commerce activities. On one hand, the company is posting positive comps at Walmart U.S. for 12 successive quarters; while on the other hand, it is also building its e-commerce capabilities through acquisitions and growing in the online grocery and delivery market. The company therefore expects sales to rise approximately 3% during fiscal 2019, backed by the sustained growth in comps and e-commerce.

http://www.abcactionnews.com/news/national/walmart-to-employ-robots-to-help-restock-shelves

 Walmart announced plans last week to employ robots in at least 50 US locations in the near future, which will assist the company's associates in keeping the shelves stocked.  Walmart said the robots will be used to check for out-of-stock items, incorrect prices and wrong or missing labels. In the selected locations, robots will be seen navigating aisles, scanning the shelves.  The robot is able to alert employees if an item is out of stock, or does not have the correct price tag.  "This new shelf-scanning technology frees up time for our associates to focus on what they tell us are the most important and exciting parts of working at Walmart – serving customers and selling merchandise," Walmart said in a statement.  Walmart said it has tested the scanning robots in a small number of stores in Arkansas, Pennsylvania and California, and the test was successful enough to expand.   Copyright 2017 Scripps Media, Inc.

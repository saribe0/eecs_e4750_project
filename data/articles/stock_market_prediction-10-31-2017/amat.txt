(NASDAQ:AMAT) and Teradyne, Inc. (NYSE:TER) are the two most active stocks in the Semiconductor Equipment & Materials industry based on today’s trading volumes. The market is clearly enthusiastic about both these stocks, but which is the better investment? To answer this, we will compare the two companies based on the strength of their growth, profitability, risk, returns, valuation, analyst recommendations, and insider trends. Growth Companies that can consistently grow earnings at a high compound rate usually have the greatest potential to create value for shareholders in the long-run. Analysts expect AMAT to grow earnings at a 28.63% annual rate over the next 5 years. Comparatively, TER is expected to grow at a 21.80% annual rate. All else equal, AMAT’s higher growth rate would imply a greater potential for capital appreciation.

 Profitability and Returns Growth isn’t very attractive to investors if companies are sacrificing profitability and shareholder returns to achieve that growth. We will use EBITDA margin and Return on Investment (ROI), which control for differences in capital structure between the two companies, to measure profitability and return., compared to an EBITDA margin of 27.58% for Teradyne, Inc. (TER). AMAT’s ROI is 17.30% while TER has a ROI of -2.20%. The interpretation is that AMAT’s business generates a higher return on investment than TER’s. Cash Flow  
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Cash is king when it comes to investing. AMAT’s free cash flow (“FCF”) per share for the trailing twelve months was +1.09. Comparatively, TER’s free cash flow per share was +1.34. On a percent-of-sales basis, AMAT’s free cash flow was 10.74% while TER converted 15.12% of its revenues into cash flow. This means that, for a given level of sales, TER is able to generate more free cash flow for investors. Liquidity and Financial Risk Balance sheet risk is one of the biggest factors to consider before investing. AMAT has a current ratio of 2.90 compared to 4.70 for TER. This means that TER can more easily cover its most immediate liabilities over the next twelve months. AMAT’s debt-to-equity ratio is 0.61 versus a D/E of 0.18 for TER. AMAT is therefore the more solvent of the two companies, and has lower financial risk. Valuation AMAT trades at a forward P/E of 15.51, a P/B of 6.96, and a P/S of 4.38, compared to a forward P/E of 19.19, a P/B of 4.15, and a P/S of 4.17 for TER. AMAT is the cheaper of the two stocks on an earnings basis but is expensive in terms of P/B and P/S ratio. Given that earnings are what matter most to investors, analysts tend to place a greater weight on the P/E. Analyst Price Targets and Opinions When investing it’s crucial to distinguish between price and value. As Warren Buffet said, “price is what you pay, value is what you get”. AMAT is currently priced at a -5.36% to its one-year price target of 59.90. Comparatively, TER is 0.8% relative to its price target of 42.40. This suggests that AMAT is the better investment over the next year. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 1.80 for AMAT and 2.10 for TER, which implies that analysts are more bullish on the outlook for TER. Risk and Volatility Beta is an important measure that gives investors a sense of the market risk associated with a particular stock. A beta above 1 signals above average market risk, while a beta below 1 implies below average volatility. AMAT has a beta of 1.83 and TER’s beta is 1.01. TER’s shares are therefore the less volatile of the two stocks. Insider Activity and Investor Sentiment Comparing the number of shares sold short to the float is a method analysts often use to get a reading on investor sentiment. AMAT has a short ratio of 1.46 compared to a short interest of 3.40 for TER. This implies that the market is currently less bearish on the outlook for AMAT. Summary Teradyne, Inc. (NYSE:TER) beats Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) on a total of 7 of the 14 factors compared between the two stocks. TER is growing fastly, has a higher cash conversion rate, higher liquidity and has lower financial risk.

Wall Street stocks dropped on Monday as markets digested recent gains at the start of a week heavy on economic news, including a Federal Reserve policy meeting. Key events this week include the October US jobs report, the expected announcement by President Donald Trump of the next head of the Fed, and earnings from Apple and other large companies. Analysts attributed the weakness on Monday primarily to buyers’ fatigue after a slew of stock market records over the last month.

(Source: Fin24) Top Pick for Tuesday: Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMAT) Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMAT) has grabbed attention from the analysts when it experienced a change of -1.39% in the last trading session to close at $55.90. A total of 7,304,772 shares exchanged hands during the intra-day trade contrast with its average trading volume of 10.34M shares, while its relative volume stands at 0.71. Relative volume is the comparison of current volume to average volume for the same time of day, and it’s displayed as a ratio. If RVOL is less than 1 it is not In Play on this trading day and Investors may decide not to trade it.  If RVOL is above 2 it is In Play and this is more evidence Investors ought to be in the name.  When stocks are *very* In Play one can see a RVOL of 5 and above.  The higher the RVOL the more In Play the stock is. Day traders strive to make money by exploiting minute price movements in individual assets (usually stocks, though currencies, futures, and options are traded as well), usually leveraging large amounts of capital to do so, therefore they trade on Stocks in Play. In Play Stocks are volatile enough to produce good risk and reward trading opportunities for both bull and bear traders intraday. Most company stocks have very little volatility. They generally move extremely slowly and they only produce big price swings when the company produces good or bad trading results, which may only happen a couple of times a year at best. In deciding what to focus on – in a stock, say – a typical day trader looks for three things: liquidity, volatility and trading volume. Liquidity allows an investor to enter and exit a stock at a good price (i.e. tight spreads, or the difference between the bid and ask price of a stock, and low slippage, or the difference between the predictable price of a trade and the actual price). If a stock does not have good liquidity then it may take some time before a broker is able to negotiate a deal to buy or sell a stock and the broker may not be able to get the sell or buy price that the trader is looking for. This is a problem for day traders and it could mean the difference between a profitable and non-profitable trade. Traders have different rules for what constitutes liquidity and a good guide is the volume of trades and volume of shares that are traded each day. 100,000 shares traded per day would be a minimum for most traders and some require 1,000,000. Trading volume is a gauge of how many times a stock is bought and sold in a given time period (most commonly, within a day of trading, known as the average daily trading volume – ADTV). A high degree of volume indicates a lot of interest in a stock. Often, a boost in the volume of a stock is a harbinger of a price jump, either up or down. Volatility is simply a measure of the predictable daily price range—the range in which a day trader operates. More volatility means greater profit or loss. After a recent check, Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMAT) stock is found to be 2.09% volatile for the week, while 1.91% volatility is recorded for the month. Technical’s Snapshot: The stock has a market cap of $59.87B and the number of outstanding shares has been calculated 1.07B.

      ’ Analyst Day and the company delivered. Attendance this year, Applied Materials’ (ticker: AMAT) 50th anniversary, was one third higher than last year and last year was an all-time attendance record. I interpret that high attendance as highly confirming of the investment community’s increased interest in and focus on Applied Materials specifically, and the wafer fabrication equipment (WFE) sector broadly. The sector is going thru a secular shift and the investment and sell-side community are both sensing and witnessing it.   Artificial intelligence (AI) deserves a special mention in terms of being a burgeoning demand driver. A few highly salient points were made at the Analyst Day on the AI front and there was a whole panel discussion focused on AI. First, there are 10 times fewer chips per wafer for leading AI chips than for other standard chips. AI chips are big and incredibly robust and sophisticated. Second, while data growth is explosive, it is estimated that less than 1% of data is being analyzed. The amount of computing power and semiconductors/silicon necessary to start meaningfully analyzing all the data being generated in the world is enormous. Third, just looking at the amount of additional memory and computing power necessary for autonomous driving suggests exponential demand growth for 3D NAND with only 1% adoption of autonomous vehicles. Fourth, the shift from traditional enterprise servers to AI graphics processing unit (GPU)-based servers require eight times more logic per server and 4x more memory. Old expectations of how much share of WFE would go to lithography-based solutions (which would be particularly beneficial to

       (LRCX) and Tokyo Electron) have been meaningfully off the mark. Back in 2011 lithography equipment represented 25% of WFE spending and it was forecasted (by Gartner) to rise to 30%-plus by 2016). Today, lithography spending is less than 20% of total WFE spending. There are so many more steps and tools necessary in making cutting-edge semis, and lithography, while still critical, has become a lesser component of total spend. The outlook of multiyear visibility of highly robust demand and the need for the transition to advanced tools has arguably never looked better. The sell side has been consistently behind in its forecasts on Applied Materials. While the sell side is likely to inevitably catch up, the market is unlikely to wait for the laggards. Notably, the market has reacted with alacrity as it has digested Applied Materials’ presentation. The stock is up over 13% from the close on the day before the Analyst Day and appears to have broken out of the consolidation mode it had been in over the last few months despite reporting a tremendous fiscal third-quarter results and outlook in August. I believe that Applied Materials deserves to trade at at least a market multiple and more appropriately at a modest premium to a market multiple. I believe Applied Materials’ double-digit multiyear top-line forecasts combined with a likely 16%-plus multiyear earnings per share compounded annualized growth rate (CAGR), leading market position and it being one of the least-expensive ways to gain exposure to some of the most compelling trends in technology (AI, Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data, Cloud, Mobile, Smart Cars, Virtual/Augmented Reality, OLED, 68”-plus displays, etc.) suggests that Applied Materials warrants a 20 times EPS multiple on 2019 earnings. As I believe Applied Materials is likely to deliver about $5 in 2019 EPS, that suggests a warranted price for Applied Materials of $100 per share sometime in the next 12-24 months. We added to our already meaningful Applied Materials position post the Analyst Day.   Get the full report on Sumzero.com   Comments? E-mail us at editors@barrons.com

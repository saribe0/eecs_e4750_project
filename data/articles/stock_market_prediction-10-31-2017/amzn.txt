My thesis today is simple. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been the cream of the froth on Wall Street. Experts insist that it’s a bubble. I sell risk into their fears for easy profits to create income from nothing. Last week, AMZN reported earnings and Wall Street absolutely loved it. The upside move was monstrous, and for a stock this size it’s mighty impressive. The critics were speechless. The report was good enough to infect most other mega-cap tech to also rally just in infectious exuberance. Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB), for example, rallied 4% on no news of its own. Forever, the knock from Wall Street experts on AMZN has been that it runs thin margins. To that I say they are looking at this from the wrong perspective. Jeff Bezos created the ultimate startup. They have been in continuous start-up mode for over a decade. When evaluating a new company, I don’t ask them to show me profitability. They should be focused on growth. AMZN has that in droves. 
Click to Enlarge In addition, the company is profitable, so that argument still lingers on perception only, not reality. In fact, the trajectory of return-on-assets (from flat to 3.6) has been steadily rising. Compare that to AAPL which is arguably the standard for all companies. Its ROA, though much higher than AMZN, is headed the wrong way. Its trajectory under Tim Cook has been steadily declining. It fell 45% from 2012 to 2016. So I argue that Bezos is using his money wisely to dominate new lines of business.

Coming off new record highs, Amazon may be planning something that could take it to even more unprecedented levels. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) may have gained approval to become a drug wholesale distributor in at least 12 states according to a recent report from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. The article listed Nevada, Arizona, North Dakota, Louisiana, Alabama, New Jersey, Michigan, Connecticut, Idaho, New Hampshire, Oregon and Tennessee as states from which Amazon reportedly received approved licenses. A New Jersey attorney uncovered the licenses, but explained that Amazon won’t necessarily be able to begin shipping prescription drugs or devices directly to consumers under the licenses he discovered. Amazon would require a pharmacy license to do so. After speaking to an industry specialist, Leerink analyst David Larsen believes Amazon is pursuing a wholesale license at this time, which he believes is the first step to getting into the pharmacy services market. A wholesaler licenses would allow Amazon to ship products to stores or pharmacies and not members. In order to get a wholesale license, pharmacists must be employed by Amazon and licensed in each state where products are being shipped. Leerink estimates that Amazon must hire or buy an asset with 20-50 pharmacists in order to be a licensed mail pharmacy in 50 states.  It appears it is not a matter of if but when Amazon will disrupt the pharmacy industry. The fear of Amazon disruption is presumably what led CVS Health Corp (NYSE: CVS) to merge with healthcare insurer Aetna Inc (NYSE: AET) in a $60 billion deal to strengthen its position in the industry if it has to face off with the colossal opponent that is Amazon. The licenses Amazon applied for may allow it to distribute more than just drug products, but also medical devices and gasses. In preparation for a potential big announcement, Amazon has hired several former executives with experience in the space, including a former director of operations at Express Scripts Holding Company (NASDAQ: ESRX) and a senior production supervisor for Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE: BSX). “It is unclear to us exactly what AMZN’s plans are, but the data in the article Is consistent with our view that AMZN will likely be entering the pharmacy services space,” said Larsen.

https://qz.com/1113129/amazon-amzn-third-quarter-earnings-shares-soar-after-amazon-beats-expectations/

Amazon has never particularly cared about hitting short-term earnings expectations. But when it does, investors go crazy. Shares of Amazon surged 8% in after-hours trading today (Oct. 26) after the company beat third-quarter expectations. Amazon reported $256 million in profit, roughly comparable to net income in the same quarter a year earlier. It generated $43.7 billion in sales, up 34% year over year and comfortably above the $42 billion in revenue that analysts were expecting. The results mean that Amazon’s sales growth has now accelerated for four straight quarters, a good sign for the company as sales growth in its crucial Amazon Web Services unit has stagnated. AWS, Amazon’s cloud services business and a reliable revenue-generator, contributed $4.6 billion in revenue in the most recent quarter, up 42% from the third quarter of 2017. That’s about the same rate that AWS grew at in the second quarter of this year, and slower than any other quarter in recent years. The main event of Amazon’s third quarter was, of course, the $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods that it completed in August. Amazon said Whole Foods contributed $1.3 billion in sales this past quarter, which ended Sept. 30. Whole Foods reported $3.7 billion in sales in its quarter ended July 2, its last one as an independent public company. 

http://www.nasdaq.com/article/amazon-amzn-3rd-quarter-earnings-what-to-expect-cm865743

Amazon earnings (Shutterstock photo) Retail giant Amazon (AMZN) is set to report third quarter fiscal 2017 earnings results after the closing bell Thursday. In the three months that ended September, the Seattle-based company is expected to earn 3 cents per share on revenue of $42.05 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when the company earned 52 cents per share on $32.71 billion in revenue. For the full year, ending December, EPS is expected to be $3.63 per share, down from $4.90 per share a year ago, while full year revenue of $174.65 billion would rise 28.4% year over year. Clearly, the e-commerce giant is still projected to put up impressive growth numbers. Notably, this is even though Amazon — now valued at close to $500 billion — is almost twice the size of Wal-Mart (WMT). That said, the company did miss its second quarter earnings estimates and signaled increased capital spending, which spooked investors into selling AMZN stock. The shares took a massive haircut as a result, falling from its all-time high of $1,083 to around $936. While the shares have rebounded somewhat, the stock is still down 7% in three months, suggesting investors are anxious whether CEO Jeff Bezos — as he’s known to do — will decide if it’s time to mash the profit accelerator or continue to building out his vision, which ultimately means higher spending. As such, on Thursday, analysts will also focus on the company’s profit margins, looking for any hint into Bezos’ thinking and whether the stock deserves its consensus price target of $1163, which calls for 20% rise from current levels. Amazon continues to invest in ways to strengthen its logistics, while also expanding internationally. The company’s plans for Whole Foods acquisition will also be a hot topic. Amazon, which immediately cut prices of some selected grocery products, has wasted no time dictating food prices. The acquisition is a way for Amazon to broaden its Prime shopper base. How much of a contribution has Whole Foods made? Piper Jaffray analysts are modeling for $1.4 billion. Beyond the top and bottom line numbers and the impact of Whole Foods, the Street will want to see how the company’s AWS (Amazon Web Services) cloud platform performs, which will dictate how much of a focus should be placed on the company’s capital spending. AWS boats more than half of Fortune 500 companies on the platform to run their businesses. It’s still the clear-cut leader in cloud market share and accounts for more than half of Amazon's operating profits in 2016, up ten percentage points than 2015. At the same time, however, competing cloud platforms from Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) are gaining traction. In the second quarter, AWS revenue rose 42% year over year to $4.1 billion, showing that it is still growing impressively. To the extent AWS, which grew 55% in the year-ago quarter, can grow at 40%-plus Thursday the Street will be pleased. This is because despite the growth deceleration, AWS is still growing twice as faster the retail segment, while producing operating margins that are ten times higher. In other words, AWS carries tons of muscle. And if Amazon can flex more of it Thursday the stock should fly towards all-time highs, and in the process assuaging investor fears about any increased sending the company may wish to adopt to maintain its competitive edge.

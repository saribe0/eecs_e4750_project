Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) has recently been identified as an interesting stock but more in-depth monitoring is needed for a trade decision. Now trading with a market value of 292.67B, the company has a mix of catalysts and obstacles that spring from the nature of its operations. In light of the many issues surrounding this company, we thought it was a good time to take a close look at the numbers in order to form a realistic perspective on the fundamental picture for this stock. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) Fundamentals That Matter It’s generally a good idea to start with the most fundamental piece of the picture: the balance sheet. The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. The trend over time is important to note. In this case, the company’s debt has been growing. The company also has 2.28T in total assets, balanced by 2.01T in total liabilities, which should give you a sense of the viability of the company under any number of imagined business contexts. Bank of America Corporation (BAC) saw 1.41 billion in free cash flow last quarter, representing a quarterly net change in cash of -9.32 billion. Perhaps most importantly where cash movements are concerned, the company saw about 1.41 billion in net operating cash flow.

 Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) Revenue Growth Potential As far as key trends that demonstrate something of the future investment potential of this stock, we need to take a closer look at the top line, first and foremost. Last quarter, the company saw 14.66 billion in total revenues. That represents a quarterly year/year change in revenues of 0.16 in sequential terms, the BAC saw sales decline by 0.04. But what about the bottom line? After all, that’s what really matters in the end. Bank of America Corporation (BAC) is intriguing when broken down to its core data. For shareholders, given the total diluted outstanding shares of 10.73 billion, this means overall earnings per share of 0.48. Note, this compares with a consensus analyst forecast of 0.47 in earnings per share for its next fiscal quarterly report.

If we consider a median price to earnings ratio on the stock, that corresponds with a stock price of 12.85. However, one should always remember: the trends are more important than the forecasts. This continues to be an interesting story, and we look forward to updating it again soon on Bank of America Corporation.

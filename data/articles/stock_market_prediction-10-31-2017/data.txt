KUALA LUMPUR — Malaysian police are investigating the leak of some 46.2 million mobile phone numbers and mobile virtual network operators (MVNO) in what could possibly be the country’s biggest personal data breach. At the same time, Internet regulator Malaysia Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) met with local telcos to brief them on the latest development regarding the ongoing probe. National police chief Mohamad Fuzi Harun said on Tuesday (Oct 31) that the investigation is being carried out by the Commercial Crime Investigation Department. “We are working with MCMC as this case is quite complicated since it involves telecommunication service providers,” he told the New Straits Times, warning that the authorities will not hesitate to take action once it identify the culprits. “We cannot reveal much as (investigations) is still ongoing. We are collecting information to ascertain how the data was leaked.” Popular Internet forum and technology magazine website Lowyat.net first reported on the data breach on Oct 19, noting that personal information of millions of Malaysians were up for sale on its online forums and that the source of breach was still unknown. It said it found out about the matter after receiving a tip-off. In a follow-up report on Monday (Oct 30), it said the leak included postpaid and prepaid numbers, customer addresses as well as SIM card details from all major telco operators, namely DiGi, Celcom, Maxis, Tunetalk, Redtone and Altel. “Time stamps on the files we downloaded indicate the leaked data was last updated between May and July 2014 by the various telcos,” Lowyat.net said. It also said the databases of Malaysian Medical Council (MMC), the Malaysian Medical Association (MMA) and the Malaysian Dental Association (MDA) were compromised. These medical databases included personal information, identity card numbers, mobile/work/home phone numbers, as well as work and residential addresses. “We have shared all details regarding the data that we uncovered, as well as how we managed to obtain all the data with the MCMC last week,” the website said. “The MCMC is following up with the relevant agencies to determine the source of the breach, but we now believe that the data was already being traded online much earlier than we first estimated. Based on the condition of the files that we obtained, we are quite certain that it has already changed hands more than once.” As a result of the breach, MCMC chief executive officer Mazlan Ismail said it had recently met with the telco providers to ensure they “understand what is going on if the police approach them to facilitate investigation.” He however did not say when the meeting took place. TODAY attempted to get further information from MCMC but a spokesperson said that it will not be commenting further. “The police are leading the investigation and because it is still ongoing, we will not be making any statements at this point in time,” said the spokesperson. Any person found guilty of selling personal data can be fined up to RM500,000 (S$160,971.88) or jailed for a maximum of three years or both under Malaysia’s Personal Data Protection Act. The legislation was enacted in 2010 to protect personal data of Malaysians from being misused. MCMC also has a general consumer Code of Practice for the communications and multimedia industry, where it spells out measures service providers should take to provide adequate security for personal data. Nevertheless, the data breach has left Malaysians worried. Mr Royce Cheah said he and his wife received an average of one call a week from companies offering personal loans and credit cards, property promotions and invitations to go for health screenings — and he suspects these companies obtained their phone numbers from other sources which may not be strictly legal. “Someone’s selling the data obviously — which means someone’s buying. As to how the data is obtained, well it would have had to be stolen or taken from somewhere right?” said the human resource recruiter. “While these phone calls may be an annoyance, I think the more worrying part is that the data obtained may include addresses and IC numbers and far more sinister things could be done with all that information.” Writer and translator Pauline Puah said Malaysians need to be careful in not divulging personal information such as phone numbers and addresses on public forums or online group chats. “Those with young children have got to be particularly vigilant, if they want to share pictures of their children make sure it is restricted among family and friends only instead of at a public forum,” she said.

Based on that sweeping reasoning, Brazilian security forces spent more than $25 million on intelligence-gathering software from 2014 to 2016, according to Brazilâs Ministry of Defense. Before the events, security officials repeatedly warned of potential violence from two types of actors: drug traffickers and political protesters. As it turned out, the police mainly went after the drug lords the old-fashioned way â with guns blazing in raids that often caught civilians in the crossfire. Government data shows that in 2016, police in Rio killed 920 people in raids â more than double the total in 2013. The surveillance tactics were focused on political threats. Prior to the World Cup final, police in Rio arrested 30 activists in their homes after tracking their electronic communications. A state judge ordered their imprisonment for planning to organize violent activities, but days later they were freed due to lack of evidence. Charges were dismissed against five of them, two were tried and absolved in a juvenile court, and the cases of 23 remain open. A spokesperson for Rioâs justice department declined to comment.  Adding to the churn are reports in the Brazilian media about government agencies sharing personal data with credit-rating companies, which some experts say could unfairly prejudice decisions on loan applications. A federal prosecutor is currently suing Brazilâs social security agency for this type of sharing, claiming violation of privacy rights guaranteed in 2002 legislation.

 WASHINGTON — The American military command in Afghanistan has decided to keep secret key figures related to the growth and progress of local security forces, redacting the numbers at the behest of Afghan officials from the latest report by the government’s watchdog for spending. The move clouds measures of progress for the Afghan security forces, the primary benefactor of the $120 billion that the United States has spent on reconstruction since the start of the war and the linchpin of President Trump’s new strategy in Afghanistan. Backed by the American military and its NATO allies, the Afghans are responsible for turning the tide of the war against the Taliban in the coming years. Among the details being kept private in the report are the number of people in the Afghan army and police force, how many of them have been wounded or killed and the state of their equipment. Advertisement “The Afghans know what’s going on; the Taliban knows what’s going on; the U.S. military knows what’s going on,” John F. Sopko, the special inspector general for Afghanistan, whose office compiled the quarterly report, said in an interview. “The only people who don’t know what’s going on are the people paying for it.” Advertisement Capt. Tom Gresback of the Navy, the spokesman for American forces in Afghanistan, defended the decision to classify the information, saying that it was done at the Afghan government’s request. 
                The American military command in Afghanistan has redacted key figures about the growth and progress of local security forces from this report by the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction.             Mr. Sopko said: “The government usually doesn’t classify good news. I don’t want any nameless, faceless Afghan bureaucrat telling the American taxpayer what they ought to know.” The information has been classified only once before, in 2015, as the Obama administration was trying to portray the war in Afghanistan as all but over. At the time, as Taliban militants surged across the country, officials said that the figures, if made public, could endanger Afghan and American lives. While the quarterly reports have had a classified annex since 2015, most of the data categories redacted in the latest release have been available to the public since the inspector general started putting out the reports in 2008. This time, the numbers were kept secret as Mr. Trump ramps up the conflict, authorizing the deployment of thousands more troops and an expanded C.I.A. paramilitary campaign as well as overseeing a volume of airstrikes not seen since 2012. Mr. Sopko’s report includes nine questions — answered publicly in the past — that have now been redacted, including the exact number of Afghan forces serving. The number of combat casualties among the Afghan military and police, the primary forces battling Taliban and Islamic State militants in the country, were also classified.

KABUL (Pajhwok): The American military has recently classified data on Afghan security forces’ casualties, personnel strength, attrition and the operational readiness of equipment, says a US government watchdog. In its latest report, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction said it was forced for the first time in eight years to give ballpark figures on force strength and authorised strength. “Exact assigned strength, progress toward authorised strength, attrition and casualty data are critical for understanding ANDSF performance, readiness and mission success,” SIGAR said. Data on attrition rates and casualty figures for Afghan security forces has also been concealed by US Forces-Afghanistan, arguing that the information belonged to the Afghan government.  “The Afghans know what’s going on; the Taliban knows what’s going on; the US military knows what’s going on,” John F. Sopko, the special inspector general, said in an interview. “The only people who don’t know what’s going on are the people paying for it.” The US forces did not provide SIGAR with performance assessments on the Ministry of Defense or Ministry of Interior. The US military told SIGAR it was moving away from tracking Plan of Action and Milestones to assess progress of Afghan institutions. Instead it will focus its assessments on the MoI and MoD through the new Afghan road map instituted by President Ashraf Ghani this year. The Afghan government’s control of territory and population is at its lowest point since SIGAR has been reporting district and population control figures in 2015, according to the report.

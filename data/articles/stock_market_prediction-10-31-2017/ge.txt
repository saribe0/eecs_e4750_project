   Bob Child/Associated Press/File General Electric Co.’s corporate headquarters campus in Fairfield, Conn., was sold last year to Sacred Heart University for $31.5 million.   HARTFORD — Before General Electric decided to relocate its long-established Connecticut headquarters to Boston, state officials offered to buy the company’s sprawling 66-acre suburban campus so GE could move to a more urban area within the state. It was one of three options offered by Connecticut officials, according to a proposal presented to GE in hopes of fending off the move. The proposal reveals the lengths to which they were willing to go to keep the cachet of GE and hundreds of jobs in Connecticut.  ‘‘We thought this could be a really unique way for us to make it easy for them to make the change here in Connecticut,’’ said the state’s Economic and Community Development commissioner, Catherine Smith. She said GE could have used proceeds from the sale to relocate to a more tech-centered, urban, transit-oriented environment within the state near higher education institutions, as desired by GE’s then-chief executive, Jeff Immelt.  Ultimately, though, GE decided to relocate to the Fort Point Channel area of Boston. Connecticut officials were under great pressure after GE threatened to move. The company referenced recent state tax increases — some of which were scaled back. A draft copy of Connecticut’s proposal, obtained by the AP through an open-records request, shows photos and details of various office complexes, mostly in Stamford, which is about 34 miles northeast of New York City and on Amtrak and commuter rail lines. Fairfield First Selectman Mike Tetreau said he would have preferred that GE remain in his town, or at least sell the property to another tax-paying entity. Fairfield has lost $1.7 million in annual local tax revenue with GE’s exit. In hindsight, he said, it’s clear GE had made up its mind to leave, especially considering the extensive improvements needed at the campus. He understands why the state offered to buy the property. ‘‘I think the state at one level tried to be creative in how they approached GE and tried to lay out as many options as possible,’’ he said. Sacred Heart University bought the property last year for $31.5 million. The state’s other options included moving some of the headquarters staff to another Connecticut city and upgrading the old campus, or making major renovations to the old campus. Financial incentives offered by the state were blacked out in the documents provided to the AP. Stamford, the hometown of Democratic Governor Dannel P. Malloy, a former mayor, also is a suggested location in the state’s bid for Amazon’s second headquarters. It is already home to various corporate headquarters, including Xerox Corp.’s. Cable provider Charter Communications announced this month that it’s planning to build its headquarters in Stamford. Smith said she doesn’t believe GE seriously considered the state’s proposal, offered a month before the company announced its decision to leave. ‘‘Sometimes there’s just a quietness that just indicates you’re not being taken seriously, and of course we knew perfectly well that lots of other states were trouping in and talking to the company,’’ she said. ‘‘So, we felt like we were a secondary tier, not a seriously considered proposal.’’ About 3,600 GE employees still remain in Connecticut, working at other locations. A GE spokesman reiterated that the company decided to move its headquarters to Boston ‘‘because of the city’s world-class colleges and universities, vibrant research and development ecosystem, and diverse, technologically-fluent workforce.’’ Smith said Connecticut has taken that message to heart, recently embarking on an initiative to help its cities and towns become places with high-growth enterprises, where people can walk, bike, or take the train to work.  Even before GE’s announcement, she said, the state tried to make urban areas more attractive to young people ‘‘walking around with genius ideas in their heads.’’ ‘‘I think if we’d had five more years,’’ she said, ‘‘maybe we could have convinced GE to stick around.’’

Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Gadfly columnist covering deals and industrial companies. She previously wrote an M&A column for Bloomberg News.
 Perhaps a wholesale breakup of General Electric Co. isn&apos;t such an improbable idea after all. The industrial conglomerate has lost $100 billion in market value this year as investors came to terms with the dawning reality that GE&apos;s businesses don&apos;t generate enough cash to support its rich dividend. It&apos;s also now clear that years of streamlining didn&apos;t go far enough as challenges of dumpster-fire proportions at its power and energy divisions overshadowed what were actually pretty good third-quarter health-care and aviation numbers.  New CEO John Flannery&apos;s pledge to divest $20 billion in assets risked being but another piecemeal breakup. But as details leak on the divestitures and other changes Flannery&apos;s contemplating, there&apos;s at least a shot he could be positioning the company for something more drastic.  One argument against a breakup of GE was that it would detract from the breadth of expertise and resources that set the company apart in the push to make industrial machinery of all kinds run more efficiently. But now, GE&apos;s approach to digital appears to be changing. Rather than trying to be everything for everyone, the company is refocusing digital marketing efforts on customers in its core businesses and deepening partnerships with tech giants including Microsoft Corp and Apple Inc. It hasn&apos;t announced any financial backers yet, but that&apos;s a possibility former CEO Jeff Immelt intimated before he departed. GE&apos;s digital spending is a likely target of its cost-cutting push. This downsizing will please investors who have viewed digital as an expensive pet project of Immelt&apos;s, but it&apos;s sort of a weird thing to do if you still want to turn GE into a top 10 software company. As is the divestiture of the digital-facing Centricity health-care IT operations that GE is reportedly contemplating. The company is unlikely to abandon digital altogether. Industrial customers have been trained to expect data-enhanced efficiency, and GE has to offer that to be competitive. As Flannery said at GE&apos;s Minds and Machines conference last week, "A company that just builds machines will not survive." But if all we&apos;re ultimately talking about here is smarter equipment, as opposed to a whole new software ecosystem, GE doesn&apos;t necessarily need a health-care, aviation and power business. Creating four or five mini-GEs would likely mean tax penalties.  That&apos;s not in and of itself a reason to maintain a portfolio that&apos;s not working. If it was, GE wouldn&apos;t also be contemplating a sale of its transportation division.  But one of GE&apos;s flaws in the minds of investors right now is its financial complexity, and there&apos;s something to be said for a complete rethinking of the way it&apos;s put together. For what it&apos;s worth, the average of JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst Steve Tusa&apos;s sum-of-the-parts analyses points to a $20 valuation -- almost in line with GE&apos;s closing price of $20.79 on Friday. Whatever premium the whole company once commanded over the value of its parts has been significantly weakened.  At the end of the day, it comes down to what kind of company GE wants to be. The financial realities of a breakup might be painful, but so would years&apos; worth of pain in its power business as weak demand and pricing pressures drive a decline to a new normal of lower profitability. Does it really matter, then, what the growth opportunities are in aviation and health care? As head of M&A at GE, Flannery was at least partly responsible for the Alstom SA acquisition that swelled the size of the now-troubled power unit inside GE. If there really are "no sacred cows," he has a chance to rewrite that legacy. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners. 
 GE&apos;s on track for a rate in the low-single digits this year -- well short of the U.S. corporate maximum of 35 percent. The tax bill involved in a sale of the century-old locomotive operations would pale in comparison to the tax leakage from a full-scale breakup, of course. A sale is arguably a better strategy than a spinoff. Potential buyers include a Chinese industrial company or perhaps an engine maker like Cummins Inc.    To contact the author of this story:      Brooke Sutherland in    New York at bsutherland7@bloomberg.net To contact the editor responsible for this story:               Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.net

              Former CEO Jeff Immelt had an extra aircraft follow his corporate jet on some overseas trips.
             General Electric  						ge 						 					 				 			 executives didn’t tell their board until October about a spare business jet that routinely flew for its now-retired chief executive, The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday, citing people familiar with the matter. Executives also didn’t tell directors that the conglomerate had received an internal complaint about the jet several years ago, the publication’s sources added. The WSJ reported on October 18 that former Chairman and CEO Jeff Immelt had an extra aircraft follow his corporate jet on some overseas trips during much of his 16 years in the role, as a precaution in case the jet carrying Immelt developed problems. GE executives first informed the board about the practice after the report, the WSJ said. GE told its directors the company had scaled back the practice in mid-2014 and would continue to use the backup plane only in limited situations, such as going to risky locations, the Journal reported. Immelt told the Journal on Thursday that he did not know the spare plane was flying. Immelt, 61, stepped down as CEO on August 1 and planned to continue as chairman through December 31. But John Flannery was named chairman on October 2. Flannery has grounded GE’s corporate aircraft fleet to cut costs and initiated a new policy under which executives will fly on commercial or charter flights, the WSJ said.

General Electric Co. executives didn’t notify the company’s board until this month about its regular flying of a spare business jet for its CEO, and it didn’t tell directors that GE had received an internal complaint about the practice several years ago, according to people familiar with the matter. GE management first informed the board about the practice after The Wall Street Journal reported Oct. 18 that former Chairman and CEO Jeff Immelt had an extra aircraft follow his corporate jet on some overseas trips during much of his 16-year tenure, the people said. The company told GE’s directors the company had reduced the practice in mid-2014 and that the continued use of the backup plane was limited to isolated situations such as travel to risky destinations. The board members were previously unaware, the people said, and some were dismayed to learn of the practice. “Obviously, this was an excess,” one of these people said. Mr. Immelt told the Journal on Thursday that he, too, didn’t know the spare plane was flying. “This is not a practice I would have allowed,” he said in an emailed statement. Mr. Immelt stepped down as GE chairman in early October after earlier resigning as CEO. The practice came to an end when Mr. Immelt’s successor, John Flannery, decided to ground the company’s fleet of corporate aircraft as part of broader cost-cutting moves. Mr. Flannery plans to sell the aircraft and changed policy so GE executives would instead fly on commercial or charter flights. The two-plane trips continued until at least this past spring, according to people familiar with the matter and flight records. They flew in years when the Boston-based giant was under investor pressure to cut spending and boost profits, part of an effort to reverse a prolonged stock slump. GE shares have tumbled more than 33% this year, and investors are bracing for a potential cut to its dividend. On March 11, for example, two GE-owned Bombardier Global Express jets took off from Boston within 19 minutes of each other and flew to Anchorage, Alaska, according to Federal Aviation Administration flight records reviewed by the Journal. One plane stayed in Anchorage for more than five days, while the other flew on to South Korea and China, according to FAA records. Mr. Immelt tweeted a photo of his visit to a Chinese factory during the trip. His plane returned to Anchorage on March 17, and within 90 minutes of his arrival, both planes left Alaska to return to the East Coast, the records show. There were similar two-plane trips to Anchorage in 2013, 2014 and 2016, with one Bombardier plane each time continuing on to Asia and back. Both planes traveled together to the Canary Islands in February 2016 and Honolulu in April 2017, flight records show. And in September 2016, the two jets followed each other around the globe on a nine-day voyage that included stops in Anchorage, Tokyo, Kuala Lumpur and Helsinki before returning to the East Coast, according to FAA records and flight-tracking services. Mr. Immelt visited several South Asian nations during the trip, according to local press reports, and was photographed with Malaysia’s prime minister. The extra plane added about $250,000 to the cost of the round-the-world trip, based on an estimated hourly cost of $6,500 to operate each Bombardier, including fixed costs such as pilot salaries and maintenance, according to Conklin & de Decker, an aviation-consulting firm. The large jets are the size of a regional airliner and typically are configured to seat 10 to 14 passengers. Sending a backup plane along is “extremely unusual,” said Jim Cannon, an aviation consultant who formerly directed a large-company flight department. “I hope it would only be done in circumstances where there was a significant need.” A GE spokeswoman said, “This practice, which GE has discontinued, involved business-critical itineraries with tight schedules, multiple international stops and, in most cases, security concerns.” “We do not believe that the understandable criticism of this discontinued practice fairly reflects on Jeff’s dedicated service to GE for over 30 years,” she added, referring to Mr. Immelt. While CEO, Mr. Immelt wanted a backup jet in case there was a mechanical issue that could lead to delays, the people said. Flight crews were told to not openly refer to the backup planes, for fear of raising eyebrows, especially at the small airport facilities for private jets, the people said. One person said the flight manifest sometimes listed “Robert Jeffries” or “Jeffrey Roberts” as the passenger on the second plane, when in fact the seats were empty. Mr. Immelt said he didn’t request the extra plane. “The Corporate Air team at GE had a practice around managing air travel that I neither instituted nor asked for,” he said. “Apparently, this policy was put in place after numerous plane failures on complicated travel to difficult global locations.” Early in Mr. Immelt’s tenure, GE would fly spare jets on domestic flights, the people said, but it later stopped that practice. On some trips, both overseas and domestic, the company would charter standby jets at different destinations, the people said. GE’s board required its CEO to fly on the company’s aircraft for both business and personal use for security reasons. GE informed its board’s compensation committee each year about how much the company had spent to fly Mr. Immelt on corporate aircraft, the people said. But those total amounts lacked details such as how many flights the CEO took, the number of pilots involved or the cost of aircraft fuel, people familiar with the process said. Directors assumed that GE’s human-resources executives had reviewed details about Mr. Immelt’s personal and business trips, according to one person. The GE board’s compensation committee should have requested more detail about Mr. Immelt’s usage because “corporate jets have become such a lightning rod” for criticism, said Beverly Behan, a corporate-governance consultant who has never advised GE.

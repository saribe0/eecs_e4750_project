Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) has put together a nice run of late. The GILD stock price today sits 24% higher than it did as recently as June, when the stock hit a three-year low. There is some good news here. As InvestorPlace’s Chris Lau pointed out, the acquisition of Kite Pharma and its CAR-T therapy makes some sense, and was met with analyst optimism. Also, InvestorPlace writer Luke Lango made a broader case for upside in the GILD stock price earlier this month. Both of my colleagues make good points  and Gilead stock looks cheap, trading at less than 11x forward EPS. But I’m not buying the rally in GILD stock. As a company, I like Gilead, and its efforts to battle hepatitis C and HIV are commendable. But as a stock, GILD isn’t as cheap as it looks, particularly when considering the broader pressure on the pharmaceutical and biotech industries. There’s one key problem that means GILD likely should only be bought at a huge discount. And I don’t think that discount is quite big enough at the moment. The approval of Yescarta, Kite’s flagship therapy, no doubt is good for GILD stock. CAR-T is a cancer treatment that uses modified versions of existing T-cells (a type of white blood cell) to create modified versions that will attack cancer cells. It’s a promising therapy — and potentially a lucrative one. As Barron’s pointed out, Kite will charge $373,000 — a huge number, but one that’s still more than $100,000 less than the existing therapy from Novartis AG (ADR) (NYSE:NVS). But from a profit standpoint, there are concerns. Notably, competition will be intense. James Brumley laid out the bull case for Juno Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:JUNO) back in August, citing its CAR-T potential. ZIOPHARM Oncology Inc. (NASDAQ:ZIOP) and bluebird bio Inc (NASDAQ:BLUE) are among myriad other smaller players working in the space. In addition, the market may not be that big — at least at first. Analyst Geoff Porges, as quoted by Barron’s, estimated just 5,300 potential patients in the U.S. That will expand over time, as the therapies improve and indications broaden. But investors expecting a major short-term profit boost from Kite will be disappointed.

However Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) quarterly earnings report ends up after the market close (October 26), the stock’s valuation still looks very compelling. Ideally, investors would want the company reporting stronger Hepatitis C drug sales, and so, higher cash flow in the quarter. In its second quarter report (back in July), Gilead reported improving non-HCV revenue, especially in the U.S. Total revenue topped $7.1 billion, down from $7.8 billion last year. Though product sales fell 8% year-over-year, U.S. product sales rose 2 percent. Sales of HCV products fell. Similarly, in Europe, competitive pressures hurt HCV sales. The company improved its cost structure by cutting expenses (excluding R&D) by 22%, to $812 million.   Gilead ended the quarter with $36.6 billion in cash and investments. Cash flow will fall in the second half of this year, due to both seasonal payments and payments for government rebates. In the next Q4 reporting period, expect cash levels to fall to around $24.7 billion, excluding cash generated in that time. Gilead is acquiring Kite Pharma for $11.9 billion, a deal set to close in the fourth quarter. Gilead said the purchase will give it opportunities to diversify its revenue. In the short term, Kite will be neutral to earnings. It will add positively to profits in the third year of ownership. For the full year 2017, GILD forecasts net product sales of between $24 billion to $25.5 billion. Non-HCV product sales are expected to be between $15.5 billion to $16 billion. HCV net-product sales are guided between $8.5 billion to $9.5 billion. The company forecasts R&D expenses of between $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion. The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) issued a positive opinion on Gilead’s application for marketing Vosevi last June. In July, the FDA approved the drug for treating HCV genotypes 1 – 6. The success of HCV is a mixed blessing for GILD. Patients cured of HCV no longer need treatment, so the company must find new patients infected with hepatitis. Once introduced into the system, the market potential grows. Then, the medical system may treat these patients. Last August, the FDA approved AbbVie Inc’s (NYSE:ABBV) Mavyret (glecaprevir and pibrentasvir), which treats adult patients with genotypes 1 – 6 chronic hepatitis C virus. Ahead of the approval, Gilead’s management said it would review AbbVie’s label on the drug, check the pricing, and watch how it markets the drug. Gilead has Vosevi and Epclusa, which may lessen the negative impact of AbbVie’s competitive pressures on Gilead’s HCV drug.

Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) has recently been identified as an interesting stock but more in-depth monitoring is needed for a trade decision. Now trading with a market value of 101.71B, the company has a mix of catalysts and obstacles that spring from the nature of its operations. In light of the many issues surrounding this company, we thought it was a good time to take a close look at the numbers in order to form a realistic perspective on the fundamental picture for this stock. Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) Fundamentals That Matter It’s generally a good idea to start with the most fundamental piece of the picture: the balance sheet. The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. The trend over time is important to note. In this case, the company’s debt has been growing. The company also has 64.66 billion in total assets, balanced by 39.41 billion in total liabilities, which should give you a sense of the viability of the company under any number of imagined business contexts. Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD) saw 3.4 billion in free cash flow last quarter, representing a quarterly net change in cash of -1.57 billion. Perhaps most importantly where cash movements are concerned, the company saw about 3.53 billion in net operating cash flow.

 Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) Revenue Growth Potential As far as key trends that demonstrate something of the future investment potential of this stock, we need to take a closer look at the top line, first and foremost. Last quarter, the company saw 6.51 billion in total revenues. That represents a quarterly year/year change in revenues of -0.13 in sequential terms, the GILD saw sales decline by -0.09. But what about the bottom line? After all, that’s what really matters in the end. Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD) is intriguing when broken down to its core data. The cost of selling goods last quarter was 1.03 billion, yielding a gross basic income of 5.48 billion. For shareholders, given the total diluted outstanding shares of 1.32 billion, this means overall earnings per share of 2.06. Note, this compares with a consensus analyst forecast of 1.89 in earnings per share for its next fiscal quarterly report. 
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Is Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) Valuation Attractive Looking ahead at valuations, according to the consensus, the next fiscal year is forecast to bring about 7.07 in total earnings per share. If we consider a median price to earnings ratio on the stock, that corresponds with a stock price of 11.45. However, one should always remember: the trends are more important than the forecasts. This continues to be an interesting story, and we look forward to updating it again soon on Gilead Sciences, Inc..

Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) and Kura Oncology, Inc. (NASDAQ:KURA) are both Healthcare companies that recently hit new low. This price action has ruffled more than a few feathers in the investment community, but is one a better investment than the other? To answer this, we will compare the two companies across growth, profitability, risk, return, dividends, and valuation measures. Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) operates in the Biotechnology segment of the Healthcare sector. The company has grown sales at a 29.40% annual rate over the past five years, putting it in the high growth category. GILD has a net profit margin of 44.40% and is more profitable than the average company in the Biotechnology industry. In terms of efficiency, GILD has an asset turnover ratio of 0.5. This figure represents the amount of revenue a company generates per dollar of assets. GILD’s financial leverage ratio is 1.42, which indicates that the company’s asset base is primarily funded by equity capital. Company’s return on equity, which is really just the product of the company’s profit margin, asset turnover, and financial leverage ratios, is 64.10%, which is better than the Biotechnology industry average ROE. Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD) pays out an annual dividend of 2.08 per share. At the current valuation, this equates to a dividend yield of 2.70%. The company has a payout ratio of 20.20%. GILD’s current dividend therefore should be sustainable. Stock’s free cash flow yield, which represents the amount of cash available to investors before dividends, expressed as a percentage of the stock price, is 0. All else equal, companies with higher FCF yields are viewed as cheaper. Company trades at a P/E ratio of 8.37 , and is less expensive than the average stock in the Biotechnology industry. The average investment recommendation for GILD, taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts, is 2.40, or a buy. Over the past three months, Gilead Sciences, Inc. insiders have been net buyers, dumping a net of -577,322 shares. This implies that insiders have been feeling relatively bearish about the outlook for GILD. Insider activity and sentiment signals are important to monitor because they can shed light on how “risky” a stock is perceived to be at it’s current valuation. Knowing this, it makes sense to look at beta, a measure of market risk. GILD has a beta of 1.16 and therefore an above average level of market volatility. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

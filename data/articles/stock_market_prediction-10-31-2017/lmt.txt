Bargain hunters are wise to pay careful attention to insider buying, because although there are many various reasons for an insider to sell a stock, presumably the only reason they would use their hard-earned dollars to make a purchase, is that they expect to make money. Today we look at two noteworthy recent insider buys.      On Wednesday, Lockheed Martin ( LMT  )'s Director, Daniel F. Akerson, made a $780,059 buy of LMT, purchasing 2,500 shares at a cost of $312.02 each. Investors are able to buy LMT at a price even lower than Akerson did, with shares changing hands as low as $307.82 at last check today -- that's 1.3% under Akerson's purchase price. Lockheed Martin is trading up about 0.6% on the day Monday. This buy marks the first one filed by Akerson in the past twelve months.  makeArticleAd();    And at Mid-America Apartment Communities ( MAA  ), there was insider buying on Friday, by Director William Reid Sanders who bought 7,000 shares for a cost of $100.11 each, for a trade totaling $700,798. Mid-America Apartment Communities is trading up about 0.2% on the day Monday.

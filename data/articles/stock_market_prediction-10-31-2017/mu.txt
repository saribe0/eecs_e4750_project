The world of autonomous driving is set to become a major industry, with the potential to grow massively over the next few decades. Investors have taken notice and are currently on the lookout for stocks that have exposure to the self-driving car push. Picking stocks in this industry might seem to be growth plays on their face. But not every company with ties to autonomous vehicles are set to pop. This is where picking a stock with real growth fundamentals can be fun and potentially rewarding, as it presents the possibility for massive returns. One stock that fits this mold for outside growth, based on real business segment fundamentals, is Micron Technology, Inc. MU. As a semiconductor giant, Micron markets its memory and data storage solutions to computer manufacturing firms, consumer electronics companies, and telecommunications powers. Micron has also invested heavily in vehicle safety technology that could prove to be foundational for a driverless car future. The company’s vehicle-focused semiconductor technology currently helps reduce human driving errors. This includes gesture control interfaces that help detect drowsy and distracted drivers and vehicle sensors that create more advanced computer “vision.” Along with these technologies, Micron’s artificial intelligence already helps vehicles detect and alert drivers to objects, pedestrians, and other hazards that might be in the road. Fundamentals  Micron is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that rocks an “A” grade for Growth. On top of that, Micron’s sports an overall VGM grade of an “A.” Shares of Micron have already surged over 133% during the last 52 weeks. Micron has seen its stock price climb nearly 47% in the last 12 weeks alone. It seems that this substantial stock price movement was based on Micron’s ability to grow both it top and bottom lines. At the end of September, Micron reported fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 results that climbed year-over-year. The company’s Q4 revenues skyrocketed 91%, while its full-year sales soared 64% to hit $20.32 billion. "Micron delivered exceptional fourth quarter and fiscal year results, reflecting solid execution and robust demand for our memory and storage solutions," Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said in a statement.  "We expect healthy industry fundamentals to continue into 2018, supported by increasingly diverse end markets and applications.” Investors who didn’t benefit from Micron’s substantial gains so far this year might be glad to know that the semiconductor company’s growth metrics are set to keep on climbing. Micron revenues are expected to jump nearly 60% in its current quarter, based on our current consensus estimates. The company seems set to keep on cruising as its full-year 2018 revenues are projected to climb almost 20% to hit an upward estimate of $24.20 billion. Micron Technology, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Micron Technology, Inc. Quote Micron has failed to top earnings estimates just once in the last three years, including posting beats in the last nine quarters. Within the last 60 days, Micron has earned four upward earnings estimate revisions for its current quarter. The semiconductor company also received four upward revisions, along with no downward changes, for its upcoming year. Micron’s earnings are projected to skyrocket over 574% in its current quarter. For its full fiscal year 2018, the company’s earnings are set to surge over 50% to touch as high as $7.76 per share. Bottom Line Based on Micron’s major 2017 success, its future growth projections, and its current Zacks Rank, it seems like a stock that growth investors should consider. When investors add these growth metrics and its Zacks Rank on top of the simple fact that Micron makes products that are becoming vitally important and necessary in the age of connected-products, this semiconductor memory powerhouse becomes even more eye-catching.

Chip maker Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) has seen its stock price rise nearly 200% since the start of 2016, as the company has found itself in the sweet spot of robust demand and constrained supply. But MU stock has just bounced around the $40 level for most of October. Is this sideways trading simply a pause in a big rally or an indication that $40 is the mountaintop for MU stock? I think it’s the former. The current dynamics of robust DRAM demand fueled by smartphones and data centers and constrained supply due to limited suppliers and heightened product complexity will continue to boost profit margins for Micron into the foreseeable future. Some day, supply will inflect dramatically upward or demand will inflect dramatically downward, and that will kill MU stock. But that day is not today. Here’s why. Bulls just received some big public support from hedge fund titan, David Einhorn. The hedge fund manager recently disclosed that his Greenlight Capital fund made three new investments in the third quarter of 2017. One of those investments was MU stock. It’s important to note here that Einhorn isn’t the type of investor who jumps on the momentum train. He is a value guy who often places bets against momentum. He is (in)famous for shorting Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA). It’s rather bullish, then, to see such a value-oriented investor who doesn’t like strong momentum names get on board with MU stock, which is up 200% in less than two years and is in the middle of what many consider a bubble. Einhorn doesn’t buy the bubble talk. He thinks that because DRAM is starting to reach its lower limit in terms of size, pricing has stopped falling and will remain stable into the foreseeable future. Meanwhile, demand is ramping up thanks to data centers and smartphones. Diversified demand streams shield MU from harsh cyclical pullbacks in demand. Plus, Einhorn likes the fact that Micron stock trades at just five times this year’s earnings estimate. Overall, it’s bullish to see one of Wall Street’s most-followed value-oriented hedge fund managers bite into Micron at a time when bears are screaming “bubble.” I continue to believe Micron will trend toward $50. Fiscal 2018 earnings will represent peak earnings for MU. Supply will begin to ramp up in 2019 as new fabs start to hit the market. Thus, gradual volume expansion in 2019 will slowly eat into Micron’s profit margins. Demand will remain high, but lower profit margins will cause earnings to fall.

Ryan Fischer/The Herald-Dispatch Huntington High senior Alexis Howard completes her 2018-2019 FAFSA inside the Student Financial Assistance offices at Marshall University on Monday, October 30, 2017, in Huntington. Ryan Fischer/The Herald-Dispatch Huntington High senior Alexis Howard gets some help from Matthew Igou on completing her 2018-2019 FAFSA inside the Student Financial Assistance offices at Marshall University on Monday, October 30, 2017, in Huntington. HUNTINGTON - Whether you are a first-time student or just planning on returning for another year, it's now time to fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, in order to get the funds to help you pay for your college studies. No matter your status, the FAFSA can be confusing. That's why Marshall University's Office of Student Financial Assistance is having two days of FAFSA filing help. The first day was Monday, and the help resumes Tuesday, Oct. 31, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. The office welcomes anyone (current and prospective students attending or interested in any university) needing to complete the FAFSA to come to Old Main Room 116 for FAFSA guidance. The office asks participants bring the following: n Your Social Security number. n Your parents' Social Security numbers if you are a dependent student. n Your driver's license number, if you have one. n Your Alien Registration number if you are not a U.S. citizen. n Federal tax information or tax returns from 2016 including IRS W-2 information, for you (and your spouse, if you are married), and for your parents if you are a dependent student. n Records of your untaxed income, such as child support received, interest income, and veterans non-education benefits, for you, and for your parents if you are a dependent student n Information on cash; savings and checking account balances; investments, including stocks and bonds and real estate but not including the home in which you live; and business and farm assets for you, and for your parents if you are a dependent student. Gathering all the required information before filing out the FAFSA is the best way to make the process quick and easy, especially when filling it out alone. Parents should also fill out the FAFSA, no matter the income level. According to a recent Discover Student Loans survey, while 74 percent of parents say they are worried about having enough money to help pay for their child's college education, only 45 percent of parents filled out the FAFSA last year. In 2016, even students from families earning more than $200,000 per year may have qualified for need-based aid from private colleges, and the FAFSA may also qualify a student for low-cost, forgivable federal student loans. The deadline to fill out the FAFSA is June 30. Visit https://fafsa.gov/, to fill out the form, create a new ID or learn more. Keep it Clean. Please avoid obscene, vulgar, lewd,
racist or sexually-oriented language.

SIOUX CENTER, Iowa – Sixth-ranked Dordt fought off the challenge of No. 9 Midland University 22-25, 25-19, 20-25, 25-19, 15-8 on Saturday. “I was disappointed that we lost the match but extremely proud of the effort our team gave today,” Midland coach Paul Giesselmann said. “Both teams played some high level volleyball. We got better today as a team, but have to continue to not make errors at critical moments of the match.” The loss drops MU to 17-8 overall, including 10-5 in the Great Plains Athletic Conference. Dordt improves to 26-5 overall, including 13-2 in the league. Both teams have clinched a top-four finish the GPAC.

The Defenders, however, went on an 8-3 run to seize control. Midland was limited to .094 hitting. Midland trailed 8-7 in the third set, but Bair’s kill tied it. The Defenders then committed three consecutive hitting errors. Dordt closed to 11-10, but two Morehouse kills and a Dordt hitting error put the Lady Warriors in control. Midland used four kills by O’Dowd to lead 6-4 in the back-and-forth fourth set.

The set was also tied at 17 and 19, but the Defenders scored the final six points, including the final two on ace serves by Aubrey Drake. Dordt hit .282 while MU was limited to .188 in the fourth set. The Lady Warriors also had three service errors. Dordt broke to a 5-2 lead in the fifth set, but Midland closed to 6-5 on a Morehouse block. The Defenders then scored five of the next six points to gain control. Midland closed to 11-8 on a Bair kill and a Dordt hitting error before the Defenders scored the final four points. O’Dowd had 16 kills while Morehouse and Bair had 14 and 13, respectively. Peters finished with 46 set assists and Jessica Nekl contributed 38 digs. Morehouse had five block assists and a solo block. Ema Altena had 20 kills and hit .259 for Dordt.

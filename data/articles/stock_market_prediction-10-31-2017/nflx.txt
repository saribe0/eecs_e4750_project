Trading volume can also indicate when an investor should take profits and sell a security because of low activity. If there is no relationship between the trading volume and the price of a security, this may be the warning sign of weakness in the current trend and a possible reversal. Historical Performances under Review: Over the last 5 days, Netflix, Inc.’s shares returned 2.77% and in the past one month the figure appeared at 10.43%.

Welles Wilder, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that gauges the speed and change of price movements. RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Traditionally, and according to Wilder, RSI is considered overbought when above 70 and oversold when below 30. Signals can also be generated by looking for divergences, failure swings and centerline crossovers. RSI can also be used to identify the general trend. Finally, analysts have given a mean recommendation of 2.20 on this stock (A rating of less than 2 means buy, “hold” within the 3 range, “sell” within the 4 range, and “strong sell” within the 5 range). Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E): PE ratio is one of the most widely used tools for stock selection. It is calculated by dividing the current market price of the stock by its earnings per share (EPS). The current market price is already described above i.e., $199.54. The current EPS for the company has been recorded at $0.99. By applying the formula, the price-earnings (P/E) ratio comes out to be 201.96. Understanding PE gives the shareholders an idea if the stock has sufficient growth potential. Stocks with low PE can be considered good bargains as their growth potential is still unknown to the market. If the PE is high, it warns of an over-priced stock. It means the stock’s price is much higher than its actual growth potential. So these stocks are more likely to crash drastically. This was evident in the recent market crash when the stocks of all Reliance companies fell sharply. This will allow savvy shareholders to sell their holdings before the stock price crashes.

 The day before Netflix (NFLX) is set to release the second season of its hit original series Stranger Things  , let's take a look at why the streaming service is still a great growth investment despite already soaring over the last few years. As many investors already know, growth stocks can be a ton of fun because they present the opportunity for potentially massive returns. With that said, investors can't just pick stocks at random and hope they turn into the next Amazon AMZN  . What they can do, however, is look for companies that currently present the possibility for hefty gains based on real growth opportunities within a business. Based on these criteria, growth-minded investors might think about taking a long look at Netflix. Last quarter, Netflix revenues jumped 33% in its all-important streaming sector. On top of that, the video-streaming powerhouse added 5.3 million subscribers-pushing the company's total to 109.3 million worldwide. The company projects that it will add another 6.3 million subscriptions this quarter. Netflix also announced plans to spend up to $8 billion on content in 2018. Looking ahead, Netflix's revenues are projected to climb over 32% next quarter, based on our current consensus estimates. The company's full-year revenues are also expected to leap around 30% to hit an upward estimate of $11.72 billion. Netflix is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and also sports an "A" for Momentum in our Style Scores system. And within the last 60 days, the company has received 13 upward earnings estimate revisions for its Q4 along with no downward revisions. During this same time frame, Netflix earned 13 upward revisions for its full-year.  Netflix, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise     Netflix, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS   Surprise    |      Netflix, Inc. Quote   Netflix is expected to see its earnings skyrocket more than 173% in its fourth-quarter. What's more, Netflix's full-year earnings are projected to soar over 192% to $1.26 per share. Shares of Netflix have already gained over 56% this year, which blows away the S&P 500 average. This positive movement has been driven by the success of its original content, along with the ability to add users at an extremely fast rate amid shifting consumer habits that favor its streaming service model. In addition to its other growth-based metrics, Netflix's stock price currently rests 5% below its 52-week high. The internet hype surrounding Friday's release of one of its biggest shows to date could help Netflix shares climb. Therefore, now might be a good time for investors looking to capitalize on its outsized growth potential to jump on Netflix.

Zacks Investment Research  The day before Netflix (NFLX) is set to release the second season of its hit original series Stranger Things  , let's take a look at why the streaming service is still a great growth investment despite already soaring over the last few years. As many investors already know, growth stocks can be a ton of fun because they present the opportunity for potentially massive returns. With that said, investors can't just pick stocks at random and hope they turn into the next Amazon AMZN  . What they can do, however, is look for companies that currently present the possibility for hefty gains based on real growth opportunities within a business. Based on these criteria, growth-minded investors might think about taking a long look at Netflix. Last quarter, Netflix revenues jumped 33% in its all-important streaming sector. On top of that, the video-streaming powerhouse added 5.3 million subscribers-pushing the company's total to 109.3 million worldwide. The company projects that it will add another 6.3 million subscriptions this quarter. Netflix also announced plans to spend up to $8 billion on content in 2018. Looking ahead, Netflix's revenues are projected to climb over 32% next quarter, based on our current consensus estimates. The company's full-year revenues are also expected to leap around 30% to hit an upward estimate of $11.72 billion. Netflix is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and also sports an "A" for Momentum in our Style Scores system. And within the last 60 days, the company has received 13 upward earnings estimate revisions for its Q4 along with no downward revisions. During this same time frame, Netflix earned 13 upward revisions for its full-year.  Netflix, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise     Netflix, Inc.

This positive movement has been driven by the success of its original content, along with the ability to add users at an extremely fast rate amid shifting consumer habits that favor its streaming service model. In addition to its other growth-based metrics, Netflix's stock price currently rests 5% below its 52-week high. The internet hype surrounding Friday's release of one of its biggest shows to date could help Netflix shares climb. Therefore, now might be a good time for investors looking to capitalize on its outsized growth potential to jump on Netflix.

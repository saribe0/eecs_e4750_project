Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) continues its red-hot performance. NVDA stock is one of the biggest winners on the Nasdaq for 2017. Shares are up 171% over the past year, and 83% 2017 year-to-date alone. Anyone skeptical of NVDA stock, including this author on occasion, has looked rather foolish. However, stock price isn’t always tied to business performance. In the case of NVDA stock, investors have bid it up far in excess of any reasonable valuation given the current balance of risk and reward. For NVDA stock to continue producing sizzling returns, just about everything has to go right for the company. The phrase “priced for perfection” was invented for situations like the one we see with Nvidia today. The story with NVDA stock starts at its frenetic earnings growth in recent quarters. Bulls can point to NVDA earnings with pride, it’s been one of the best stories of the year so far. The company has grown earnings by a rather astounding 137% over the past year. For the first half of 2017, compared to 2016, revenue climbed 53%, free cash flow generation by 17%, and net income by 125%. Those are amazing numbers, though net income and earnings are clearly running ahead of actual sales and cash flow, powered by improving margins and mix. All five of Nvidia’s product categories showed year-over-year growth. Only professional visualization came in under 10% growth; the other four segments all grew by at least 20%. Assuming full-year 2017 estimates are achieved, auto revenues will be up almost 5x since 2014, data center up 4x, and gaming up almost 3x. That’s some pretty heady stuff. Unfortunately, Nvidia’s growth rate is set for a serious slowdown. Analyst consensus has earnings rising from 3.49 over the past 12 months to just 4.02 next year. The company is heading for less than 20% growth next year, and analysts peg the five-year compounded growth rate going forward at just 13%. That’d put earnings in 2022 around seven bucks a share, which is nowhere near enough to justify a $200 stock price today. Sure, you can say, analysts are probably sandbagging. Nvidia tends to beat guidance when reporting quarterly results. But even assuming they beat guidance comfortably, it’s still hard to justify anything close to the current price. Given the relatively slow rate of EPS growth for the current year, the P/E ratio will barely budge. NVDA stock is at 56x PE now and is expected to fall to just 49x in 2018. Why is earnings growth slowing down so dramatically? Here’s some real NVDA news that many folks tend to gloss over. It’s worth remembering that Nvidia generates close to 70% of its revenues from gaming and professional visualization. The gaming division has benefited from the launch of a bunch of new cards. That pulled forward demand, but don’t expect that sales momentum to continue let alone accelerate. And Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) will almost certainly hit back with new graphics cards launches of their own to try to take back share from Nvidia. Nvidia has also profited from card sales due to the boom in Bitcoin, Ethereum and other such cryptocurrencies. However, logic dictates these markets will slow down sooner or later. Already, as part of AMD’s earnings miss recently, they conceded that mining card demand is “leveling off.” That as cryptocoins continue to soar. What happens to this source of demand once Bitcoin prices stall out, let alone correct sharply?

Acting as the blue chip in today’s trade, NVIDIA Corporation’s existing market cap value showcases its prevailing assets, capital and revenues. It also indicates that the share tends to be less volatile and proves to be more attractive than smaller companies because of their stability and the likelihood of higher dividend offers. The company’s P/E ratio is currently valued at 57.79, with a forward P/E of 50.23. The existing P/E value will allow investors to easily determine whether the company’s stock price is cheap or expensive. Corporations that acquires a higher P/E ratio are usually growth stocks. However, their relatively high multiples do not necessarily indicate that their shares are overpriced and not good buys for the long term. NVIDIA Corporation has a current ratio of 7.8, indicating whether the company’s short-term assets (cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, receivables and inventory) are readily obtainable to pay off its short-term liabilities. Theoretically, the higher the current ratio, the better. The corporation holds a quick ratio of 7, signifying the short-term liquidity and the ability to use its quick assets to pay the current liabilities. However, investors should also know that this is not the whole story on company liquidity. It’s ROA is valued at 23.90% marking the total profit the company generates as a percentage of the value of its total assets. Generally, the higher the ROA, the better it is. A falling ROA is almost always a problem, but investors and analysts should also know that the ROA does not account for outstanding liabilities and may signpost a greater profit level than actually derived. The firm has a ROI of 19.80%, calculating the gain or loss generated on investment relative to the sum of money invested. Return on investments is normally expressed as a percentage and is used for personal financial decisions. The existing ROI value of NVIDIA Corporation outlines the firm’s profitability alongside the efficiency of different investments. NVIDIA Corporation has an EPS value of 3.49, demonstrating the portion of the company’s earnings, net of taxes and preferred stock dividends that is allotted to each share of common stock. The current amount sensibly gauges the company’s liability per unit of shareholder ownership and indicates whether it is a key driver of share prices. The current share price of NVIDIA Corporation is valued at $201.86 with a change in price of 3.15%. Company has a target price of $171.77. The existing EPS value gives an insight into the company’s EPS growth this year at 137.90%. With this in mind, the EPS growth for the following year measures at 10.66%. It has an EPS growth of 22.20% for the past five years, indicating an EPS value of 12.92% for the next five years. The sales growth for the past five years is 11.60%.

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) trades at $201.86 having a market capitalization of $117.41 billion. NVDA stock price climbed 185.6% over the past year, yielding a positive weighted alpha of 156.8 percent. Since an alpha above 1 hints at more gains, investors can predict some further rally scope.  Weighted Alpha is used to calculate how much a share has gone up or down over a certain period, normally a year. In general, more thrust is placed on most recent actions by assigning higher weights to it than those assigned to past movements. This assists to give a return figure that has a stronger focus on the most current period and is thus a better measure for short-term analysis. This technique is highly famous among technical analysts. If the stock is up it will have a positively weighted alpha. If the stock price is unchanged its weighted alpha will be smaller. A stock price loss will yield a negatively weighted alpha.  Support is likely to come between $198.45 a share to $195.04 a share level. However, if the NVDA shares go below $195.04 then it would indicate a much weaker market for the company. In that case, its shares would mark a 3.38% decline from the most recent price. The typical day in the last two weeks has seen about a 2.2% volatility. The average volume for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been 15.76 million shares per day over the past 30 days. NVDA has a 1-week performance of 2.52%. NVDA price is down nearly 0% from its 52-week high price of $201.87 a share but is up about 67.02% from its 52-week low price of $66.57 a share.  Match Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:MTCH) has accumulated 2.52% over the course of one week. It seems that Match Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:MTCH) might see muted action given an ABR of 2.4 or Hold rating. Analysts, on average, seem bullish as they suggest MTCH is worth $0.92 more, giving a target price of $26.93 a share. NVDA share have rallied by 89.11% in percentage terms since the start of the year – and added 14.9% in the last month. Volume in the last session has increased compared with NVDA’s average trading volume. We think the increased volume is representative of buyers as it has displayed in many other cases.  MTCH’s Stochastic Oscillator (%D) is at 44.95%. Values of %D line that are above 80 indicate that the security is overbought; prices could well fall in the near future. And the values below 20 that it is oversold indicate prices could very well bounce upwards. The Stochastic Oscillator is a powerful technical tool that is somewhat surprisingly easy to understand. In a basic sense, it is used by technicians to measure the speed or momentum of the price movement. It represents the location of the previous close relative to the price range over a set number of periods. This can be more easily understood, however, by pulling apart the two lines on the stochastic oscillator and explaining the simple underlying mathematical formulas. The first line is called the %K line, which analyzes the actual price movements in the shares and can be defined as: %K = (Current Close – Lowest Low)/(Highest High – Lowest Low) * 100. The second line, the %D line is simple a 3-day moving average of the %K line. There are three primary ways to read the Stochastic Oscillator in search of entry points, but traders should follow the %D line closely because that indicates major trends on the chart.  Match Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:MTCH)’s latest quote $26.01 $6.17 3.17% will find technical support in $25.23 a share and a breakdown below this region would be a significantly bearish signal for Match Group, Inc. traders. Any way you dice it, a dip below $24.46 a share would be very bad news for MTCH’s technical picture in the near-term. The $24.46 level represents at least another 5.96% downside for the stock from its current price. If Match Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:MTCH) shares can stay above the price resistance around $26.53 a share, that could help propel Match Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:MTCH) higher to the next line of resistance at $27.06 a share. The typical day in the last one month has seen about a 2.98% volatility. MTCH is down around 42.02% from its 12-month high of $15.08 notched on Nov 02, 2016 but is -1.04% above its highest point the past 12 months of $26.28 a share.

On the other hand if price drops, the contrary is right. For NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Stochastic %D value stayed at 61.34% for the last 9 days. Considering more the value stands at 82.94% and 86.62% for 14 and 20 days, in that order.

However the indicator does not specify the price direction, rather it is used first and foremost to measure volatility caused by gaps and limit up or down moves. The ATR is fairly simple to calculate and only needs historical price data. ATR is counted for different periods, like 9-day, 14-day, 20-day, 50-day and 100-day.

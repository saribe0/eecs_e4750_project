 @FredericLambert Tesla (TSLA) is set to release its third quarter 2017 financial results on Wednesday, November 1 after market close. As usual, the release of the results will be followed by a conference call and Q&A with Tesla’s management at 2:30pm Pacific Time (5:30pm Eastern Time). Here we take a look at what both the street and retail investors are expecting for the quarterly result.

(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Deliveries The third quarter 2017 was Tesla’s first for Model 3 production and deliveries, albeit still only to Tesla employees, family members of employees, and company insiders. The automaker was also plagued with “production bottlenecks” during the early production process, which led to only 220 Model 3 deliveries. Despite the low volume of Model 3 deliveries, Tesla delivered a record number of vehicles during the third quarters:  26,150 vehicles. Tesla delivered 14,065 Model S sedans and 11,865 Model X SUVs:  It’s a new record global delivery number for Model X – beating the previous record in Q1 2017 by over 300 units. As for Model S, it’s the third highest number for Model S delivered, which shows that the launch of Model 3 had a minimal impact on deliveries so far. Tesla generally adjusts those numbers slightly during the earnings results. Revenue Wall Street’s revenue consensus is $2.919 billion for the quarter and Estimize, the financial estimate crowdsourcing website, predicts almost the same result: $2.956 billion in revenue. The record delivery number for Model S and Model X resulted in this increase on the results quarter-to-quarter from Tesla’s actual revenue of $2.790 billion during the last quarter. It’s also a significant increase year-over-year from $2.298 billion in revenue in Q3 2016. The predictions for Tesla’s revenue over the past 2 years – Estimize predictions in blue – Wall Street consensus in grey – Actual results in green:  Tesla has been on a good streak – beating revenue expectations every quarter for the past 5 quarters now, but expectations are higher this time around due to record deliveries. Earnings Earnings per share, or rather loss per share, is expected to plunge for the quarter. Like for revenue, the expectations are again close for both the street and retail investors. The Wall Street consensus is a loss of $2.45 per share for the quarter, while Estimize’s prediction is a loss $2.25 per share. Earnings per share over the last 2 years – Estimize predictions in blue – Wall Street consensus in grey – Actual results in green:    As you can see, earnings have been more of a wild card for Tesla. A more important loss is expected this quarter as the start of Model 3 production without significant deliveries will put pressure on the company’s financials. Other expectations for the shareholders letter and analyst call Obviously, we expect that a fair amount of the conference call and shareholders letter to revolve around Model 3 production and how it has evolved since the end of the quarter. Recent reports suggested that the bottlenecks were at the Fremont factory, where Model 3 is being built and assembled, and another report said that the production bottlenecks are due to suppliers. Last week, Tesla CEO Elon Musk hinted that there might be issues at Tesla’s Gigafactory in Nevada, where the Model 3 battery pack and drive unit are being manufactured. Investors and analysts will be looking for Musk to clarify the situation. As for Model 3 reservation holders, the deadline for the first regular customer deliveries is today. It looks like we will be looking for an updated timeline here. Shareholders will also be looking for updates on the launch of Tesla’s solar products under its own brand as it started phasing out SolarCity. It’s always hard to estimate the volume from Tesla’s energy division, but there has been evidence that Powerwall 2 installations finally started to accelerate and the company also had several commercial projects with Powerpacks. They also installed a few more solar roof tile installations at employee homes. Tesla’s leadership is likely to also give an update on the status of those more recent product programs. Join us on Electrek on Wednesday after market close for our report on the results and shareholders letter. You can stick around after for the conference call with management at 2:30pm Pacific Time (5:30pm Eastern Time) and you can join on the call through Tesla’s investor relations website. Tesla is a transportation and energy company. It sells vehicles under its 'Tesla Motors' division and stationary battery pack for home, commercial and utility-scale projects under its 'Tesla Energy' division.

  Tesla Inc. TSLA  is set to report third-quarter 2017 results after market close on Nov 1. Last quarter, the electric car maker saw an earnings beat of 31.4%.  makeArticleAd();  In the trailing four quarters, the company beat and missed estimates twice each, resulting in an average negative earnings surprise of 77.4%.   Let us see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.   Tesla Inc. Price and EPS Surprise      Tesla Inc. Price and EPS Surprise    |      Tesla Inc. Quote    Factors Influencing this Quarter    Tesla has not been able to meet third-quarter 2017 production goals of the new Model 3 sedan. During the quarter, the company delivered only 220 Model 3s and produced 260, which fell short of the production target of 1,500. This indicates that the production has not been as smooth as anticipated.    However, during the quarter ending Sep 30, Tesla delivered 26,150 vehicles, reflecting a rise of 4.5% year over year and 17.7% sequentially.    The rise was due to record deliveries of Model S and Model X during the quarter.    In July 2017, the company started producing Model 3, which comes at half the starting price of Model S. In its second-quarter earnings results Tesla had said that it would aims at achieving a run rate of 5,000 and 10,000 units per week in 2017 and 2018, respectively.    However, as a result of the initial target miss, customers have already started doubting if the company will manage to achieve its target in the future.   Earnings Whispers    Our proven model does not conclusively show that Tesla will beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below.   Zacks ESP  : Tesla has an Earnings ESP of -4.49% as the Most Accurate estimate of a loss of $2.56 is wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $2.45. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter  .   Zacks Rank  : Tesla carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).    We caution against the Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or #5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.   Stocks to Consider    A few companies with the right combination of elements to come up with an earnings beat this quarter are:    Horizon Global Corporation HZN  has an Earnings ESP of +5.82% and a Zacks Rank #3.    You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks   here   .    The company is expected to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 31.    Meritor, Inc.

In June, I discussed the reasons why I thought Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) could hit $1,000. At the time, TSLA stock was trading around $360. Since then it’s taken a small step backward.  I gave what I thought was an honest analysis of what has to go right for TSLA to hit one million vehicles produced annually by 2020; should the company do that, hitting $1,000 is anything but impossible—but it has to get to a million.  Nearing the end of October, Tesla’s got 38 months to hit that production number. To hit $1,000, TSLA stock has to grow at 43% compounded annually over the next three years; a 48% return in 2018 would get it to $500. A 48% decline would drag it down to $176, but I’ve rounded it up to $200 for simplicity’s sake. Which does TSLA stock hit in 2018? $200 or $500? The heavy hitter wrote a very unflattering letter to clients Oct. 24 about Tesla. Of course, what’s Einhorn going to say when he’s got a significant short position in the company’s stock. In August I acknowledged Einhorn’s short, concluding my article by suggesting that Tesla’s stock would be overvalued if it doesn’t hit monthly production of 20,000 Model 3s by the end of the year. “The Wall Street Journal reported that the much-hyped Model 3 was indeed in production — by hand,” wrote InvestorPlace’s Lawrence Meyers discussing Tesla’s instance valuation recently. “Another source even says that the Model 3 is still being developed. Wasn’t this the car Musk said would be delivered in 2016?” That doesn’t sound like a company ready to produce 20,000 vehicles per anytime soon, does it? Einhorn certainly doesn’t think so. “Given the performance of certain stocks, we wonder if the market has adopted an alternative paradigm for calculating equity value,” wrote Einhorn in his letter to clients. “What if equity value has nothing to do with current or future profits and instead is derived from a company’s ability to be disruptive…?” That describes Tesla to a tee.  Unfortunately, David, the value placed on any stock is merely a number both the buyer and seller can agree to. One man’s gold is another man’s garbage; Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, yadda, yadda, yadda.    Bottom line: Einhorn might be right that TSLA stock isn’t worth the paper it’s written on but until a majority of investors come to this conclusion, TSLA will continue to trend higher.

Ahead of  Tesla Inc  (NASDAQ: TSLA)'s  third-quarter results,  Baird analyst Ben Kallo said he'd buy the shares on any weakness. Though cautious into the quarter, Baird remains a long-term buyer, Kallo said in a Wednesday note.  Tesla is scheduled to release its results after the market close Wednesday, Nov. 1.  The firm maintained its Outperform rating and $411 price target for Tesla.  At the time of writing, shares of Tesla were slipping 3.29 percent to $326.24. Baird Lowers Estimates Baird lowered its estimates for Tesla to reflect lower absorption from the  Model 3,  which Kallo said will impact margins, and potentially lower ASPs on the Model S and Model X vehicles.  The firm projects Tesla's third-quarter revenues at $2.879 billion; gross margin of 16.3 percent; and a loss per share of $2.78. This represents a scale down from Kallo's earlier expectations for revenues of $3.058 billion, a gross margin of 18.4 percent and a loss per share of $2.21. Despite the Model 3 ramp being one to two months behind schedule, Tesla will successfully ramp production and meet intermediate production targets, Kallo said. If production challenges continue through April 2018, the production ramp will become a larger issue, given the potential need for  additional capital, Kallo said.  Tesla's upcoming semi-truck unveiling Nov. 14, should serve as a positive catalyst, Kallo said. The continued ramp of the Model 3 and progress toward becoming cash flow positive are Tesla's two largest catalysts, the analyst said.

Billionaire investor Ron Baron raised eyebrows in the past when he predicted that Tesla [NASDAQ: TSLA] stock could hit $1,000 by 2020. However, following recent stock price declines amid concerns over Model 3 manufacturing bottlenecks and reports of supplier constraints, Baron’s Alex Umansky still maintains a positive outlook for the Silicon Valley-based electric car maker. “In todayâs market environment, everyone is trigger happy because we are bombarded with information,” says Umansky. TheÂ star fund managerÂ thinks long-term, emphasizing a patient investing approach. “It becomes very difficult for investors to do nothing.” Umansky points to Amazon and Tesla as stocks that require patience and a buy-and-hold investing strategy. Can slow-and-steady investing win the race? Despite the doubts that crop up around Tesla, Umansky and Baron remain big fans in the company and see Tesla as nothing less than a reincarnation of Amazon. “Tesla is in the early stages of being the game changer in cars that Amazon.com was in retail years ago.” notes Marketwatch. As the Oracle of Omaha, “Warren Buffett loves to say, doing nothing is often the best thing. Or as Umansky puts it: ‘You have to be patient because greatness takes time.’ It took years for Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos to prove his sacrifice of near-term profits to invest for long-term gains made sense. Or for him to develop the credibility he now has among investors. So Umanskyâs time horizon on stocks is five years or more.” Looking at Amazon, âThey spend more in cloud computing research and development than their closest competitor has in revenueâ in the space, says Umansky. He also sees Tesla’s hefty R&D investments reaping rewards over the long-term. “Tesla is much more than just a pioneer in electric cars. Tesla may ultimately be the leader in ‘clean, autonomous, shared mobility,’ predicts Umanksy. ‘They could have the largest network of self-driving cars, which can easily replicate what Uber does.'” Baron Funds most recent investor letter also emphasizes the importance of investing in strong management. Umansky agrees: “Part of his conviction stems from meetings with Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Like Bezos, Musk has an enthusiasm for thinking big, investing for the long term and continually experimenting with ideas to find the ones that work.” Others on Wall Street have also noted parallels between Tesla and Amazon. But, at the end of the day, Umansky admits to being “swayed by his own test driving of Tesla cars, something he encourages investors to do. ‘The product is so vastly superior,’ says Umanksy. Here, he takes a page from the book of another investor great, Peter Lynch, who as a fund manager at Fidelity urged investors to invest in companies that make products they know and like.” === Note: Article originally published on evannex.com, by Matt Pressman Interested in solar?

https://www.nystocknews.com/2017/10/31/analyzing-the-insider-data-for-tesla-inc-tsla/

The price of Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) over the past year has increased 60.06% while the S&P 500 has increased 20.80%. During the past 20 days, TSLA has decreased -6.28% while the broad market has increased 1.76%. TSLA ‘s 20-day moving average currently sits above its 100-day moving average. This is a bullish signal that suggests the stock price might continue to rise. TSLA’s average trading volume during the past 20 days is higher than the average volume over the past 100 days, which could be an indication that investors are feeling more certain than usual about the direction of TSLA’s future price movements. Recent trading patterns in the stock of Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) have investors on high alert. Analysts often look at historical trading patterns to predict a stock’s future performance. In the case of TSLA, the data might be telling investors a thing or two about where the stock is headed. In the most recent quarter, institutional ownership decreased by a net of 10.58 million shares, or 11.15%.This is a bearish sign and indicates that institutions are feeling more pessimistic about the outlook for TSLA overall.387 holders increased their positions, 268 decreased their positions, and 125 holders held their positions. Among institutions that increased their positions, 129 were new positions. Among holders that decreased their positions, 63 sold out of the stock Tesla, Inc.. Insider ownership during the latest quarter decreased by a net of 48928 shares, indicating that TSLA’s key executives are feeling more bearish about the stock than they did three months ago. 2 or 20% of the trades during the past quarter were buys, and 8 or 80% were sells. Insider ownership during the last year has increased by a net of 2.23 million shares. 26.79% of insider trades in the last 12 months were buys, and 73.21% were sells. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) has a 20-day RSI of 36.29%. According to this momentum indicator, a reading between 30 and 70 suggests the stock is not especially cheap or expensive, and not on the brink of a trend reversal. The MACD tells a different story. TSLA’s 9-day MACD currently sits above the 20-day MACD, indicating that TSLA’s downside momentum has increased during the last three weeks. This suggests that the trend will likely continue.

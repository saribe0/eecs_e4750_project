 (RTTNews.com) - Under Armour, Inc. (UA, UAA) announced, for fiscal 2017, adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $0.18 to $0.20. Previously, the company projected full year adjusted earnings per share of $0.37-$0.40, excluding the impact of the restructuring plan. Net revenue is now expected to be up at a low single-digit percentage rate reflecting lower North American demand and operational challenges due to the implementation of the company's enterprise resource planning system and related service levels.

On average, three analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected the company to report profit per share of $0.19 for the quarter. Analysts' estimates typically exclude special items. Third-quarter revenue was down 5 percent to $1.41 billion. During the third quarter, operational challenges due to the implementation of the company's enterprise resource planning system and related service levels along with lower North American demand negatively impacted revenue. Analysts expected revenue of $1.48 billion for the quarter. Shares of Under Armour were down 15% in pre-market trade Tuesday. For comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.com

(Reuters) - Under Armour Inc slashed 2017 sales and profit forecasts and reported its first year-on-year fall in revenue in the third quarter as it took an $85 million charge for restructuring and faced fierce competition from Nike <NKE.N> and Adidas <ADSGn.DE>. Under Armour profit hit by restructuring charge Excluding certain items, earnings for the producer of Stephen Curry basketball shoes came in at 22 cents per share, beating analysts' average estimate of 19 cents.

WITH THE MOVES: Midfielder Josh Ocel ’18 jinks past his Washington University in St. Louis defender in a home match this past Friday. The men’s soccer team had a challenging slate of games this past week, facing off against two formidable opponents in Washington University in St. Louis and the University of Chicago. The squad opened the week with a nail-biter, narrowly edging WashU in a riveting golden-goal victory in double-overtime. The team, however, could not keep its good fortunes going into its contest against University Athletic Association rival UChicago. In a tight match between the two postseason regulars, UChicago was able to pull out a victory over a Brandeis squad that continues to struggle against elite opponents. Judges 0, UChicago 1 The Judges ended their week with a heartbreaking loss to perennial powerhouse University of Chicago — their first home defeat of the season. The loss is made more bitter since Chicago is one of the Judges’ UAA rivals.  The match started relatively slowly, with the Maroons owning an 8-6 shot advantage in the first half. The Judges saw a serious opportunity to score in the 38th minute, when forward Marino Espiga ’18 had his shot attempt blocked by Chicago rookie goalkeeper Aaron Katsimpalis. Forward Andrew Allen ’19 got his foot on a follow-up attempt, but his shot was likewise stopped by the Maroon defense. Katsimpalis brought his heroics into the second half, saving a free-kick attempt by Judges’ star forward Josh Ocel ’18 in impressive fashion.  The Maroons broke through in the 80th minute when sophomore forward Dayo Adeosun capitalized on a defensive miscue in the box that left him with a shot opportunity. Adeosun’s attempt was blocked by Judges goalkeeper Greg Irwin ’20, but the rebound found its way to Maroons rookie forward Carter Romero, who buried what would prove to be the game-winning goal. The Judges had a solid chance to even the score in the 84th minute, when forward Jake Warren ’20 nearly netted a high-arching rocket to force overtime. The forward, however, was unable to convert.  The loss dropped the Judges to 12-4 on the season and 4-2 in UAA play. The victory brought the University of Chicago to 15-2 on the year and 5-1 in UAA play. Judges 2, WashU 1 The Judges opened their week on a high note, notching a victory against WashU. The squad was propelled by a beautiful golden goal from forward Alex Walter ’20 in the game’s second overtime.  WashU struck first with a goal in the 12th minute from junior forward Ryan Sproule. Sproule was assisted by freshman midfielder Sean Connors, whose pretty cross put Sproule in the perfect position to net a well-placed header. The Judges were not down long, evening the score in the 26th minute off a goal from forward Max Breiter ’20. Breiter was assisted by forward Dylan Hennessy ‘20. Neither team was able to take the lead before the end of regulation.  The Judges controlled the first overtime period, seeing two solid opportunities to score the game’s decisive winning goal. Bears’ senior goalkeeper Colin McClune was able to stifle the Judges’ offensive attacks, sending the game into a second overtime. During the second overtime, the Judges earned back-to-back corner kicks, finding the back of the net on the second try. Walter punched in the game’s golden-goal off an Ocel cross that found its way through the Bears’ defense and ultimately sent the Judges to victory against their longtime foe.  The Judges ended the match with a 15-10 edge in shot attempts and a 6-4 advantage in corner kicks.  The victory brought the Judges to 12-3-0 on the year and 4-1 in UAA play. The loss dropped WashU to 7-6-1 on the year and 1-4 in conference play.  Looking ahead, the Judges face off against New York University in their last match before postseason play. The Judges look to generate momentum for a long postseason run with a victory in their last contest of what has proven to be a very successful regular season.

 UAA outblocked the best blocking team in NCAA Division II and avenged an early-season loss with a five-set victory over No. 25 Central Washington on Thursday at the Alaska Airlines Center.  Junior outside hitter Chrisalyn Johnson supplied a career-high 24 kills, 15 digs, four block assists and provided the final four points for the Seawolves, who won 21-25, 25-15, 28-26, 19-25, 15-11.  UAA recorded 13 team blocks to eight for the Wildcats, which led the nation with 2.95 blocks per set heading into the match.  "We'd played them once and we knew we were going to have to do something different if we wanted to be successful this time," UAA coach Chris Green said in a press release. "I think our hitters did a better job of finding seams and mixing it up – mixing in the tip and mixing in roll shots.  "We outblocked them 13-8, so that was a huge accomplishment for us against a team that came into the match No. 1 in the nation in that category."  The win is the fifth straight for UAA, which improved to 15-7 on the season and 10-3 in the Great Northwest Athletic Conference. The Seawolves moved into a third-place tie in the conference with Central Washington (15-6, 10-3 GNAC).  In the fifth set, the teams were tied 7-7 before UAA took its final lead on a Casey Davenport service ace. Later in the set, Johnson hammered home the match point from the left side for her sixth kill of the set.  The third set was the closest of the night, with six ties, two lead changes and 28 points needed for the UAA win.  The Seawolves trailed at set point before a Johnson kill tied the game at 24-24. The squads went back-and-forth until UAA finally got consecutive points on a Davenport kill and Central Washington error.  Davenport, a freshman setter from Auburn, Washington, registered 50 assists, 29 digs and five kills for UAA.  Junior right side hitter Leah Swiss tallied a double-double with 12 kills and 17 digs, and junior middle blocker Tara Melton contributed 11 kills and seven block assists.  The Wildcats were led by Shelby Mauritson (17 kills, 22 digs), Sabrina Wheelhouse (13 kills) and Kyla Morgan (39 assists).

As fall sports head into postseason play, UR Men’s and Women’s Basketball are beginning their preseason training, focusing on a conference championship and an NCAA tournament berth. The women were picked to win the University Athletic Association title for this season by the conference’s head coaches, receiving six first-place votes. The men were pegged to finish fourth out of eight teams, despite losing  three stars, Sam Borst-Smith, Mack Montague, and Zach Ayers, to graduation. “We have been having a great preseason so far,” senior forward Tucker Knox said. “All the returners have been playing well together and the freshman are quickly getting up to speed.” Last season, both teams received bids into the NCAA tournament. The men made it all the way into the Elite Eight but lost to Whitman College 91–87 in their final game. The women were defeated by local rival SUNY Geneseo 78–72 in the second round. With an 8–6 record in the UAA, the women finished third in the conference and were 18–9 on the season. The men finished second behind the University of Chicago in the UAA last season with a 10–4 record, and went 24–5 overall. Washington University was picked to win the men’s conference title again this season and received seven first-place votes. Emory University received the other vote for first place and was picked to finish second in the conference. The spot above UR belongs to the University of Chicago, who proved to be tough competition for the Yellowjackets in the two games they played last season. UR defeated the Bears 88–82 in the first game at home and lost 90–87 at their game in Chicago. Behind UR Women’s Basketball, the University of Chicago received two first-place votes and came second in the poll. Washington University, who went 26–3 last season, won the conference last year but were predicted to finish third in 2018.  The return of starters senior post Al Leslie, senior forward and guard Lauren Deming, sophomore guard Lauren Foley, and sophomore point guard Brenna James contributed to receiving votes for winning the UAA title. Leslie had a strong junior year with 21.9 points per game (fourth in UR history), 9.7 rebounds per game, and 44 blocks. Deming followed her with 12.3 points and 7.5 rebounds per game. Last season, Leslie earned three All-America honors and was named East Region Player of the Year by the USBWA and All-Rochester Area Player of the Year. She also set a UR single-season free throw record and holds the second-place spot in school history for single-season points, field goals, and field goal percentage. For the men, junior point guard Jacob Wittig (8.8 ppg, 4.7 apg) and Knox (5.9 ppg, 4.6 rpg) will return to the court as starters. Other key players include junior guard Ryan Clamage, who appeared in all 29 games last season and finished fifth on the team in scoring with 7.5 ppg, and junior guard Michael Mangan who played in 29 games and was ranked 16th in the UAA in steals. Senior guard Kyle Parker, the team’s manager last season, is an addition to the roster this year. He transferred from Grinnell College in the fall of 2016, where he averaged 16 points per game as a junior for the Pioneers. “We have a ton of talent and I think we could surprise people in the UAA,”  Knox said. “We look to build upon the success of last year and be a contender for UAA champions.”   UR Women’s Basketball will play their first game of the season in the Chuck Resler Tournament at the Palestra against Capital University on Nov. 17., with the men playing Bard College on the same day.

The 2017 UAA cross-country championship race was full of new experiences for the Washington University cross-country teams, though with some familiar results. The men’s and women’s cross-country teams competed in Woodland Park, N.J. to defend their UAA crowns Oct. 28. It was their first time ever running at the course and the unique structure presented some adjustments for the team. The women’s cross-country team celebrates its UAA championship win this weekend. In addition to the women’s team’s win, the men’s team also won a UAA title in New Jersey Oct. 28. “[There were] lots of rocks, very little grass and road crossings,” head coach Jeffrey Stiles said. “The footing was questionable in lots of places, arguably dangerous. It was one of those ones where you’re hoping not to come out with any injuries. We had a couple kids who went down on rocks or whatnot, but overall it went very well.” The men’s and women’s teams were not affected much by the troublesome terrain. Both finished first in the race, running away with the championship medals. In the 8-kilometer course, the men (ranked ninth) finished with a score of 40 and a total time of 2:11:24, two minutes and 39 points ahead of the second placed Carnegie Mellon University. The seventh-ranked women scored 37 points in their 6-kilometer race, adding up to a time of 2:00:09, one minute ahead and 37 points below the University of Chicago. Senior David O’Gara led all male runners in the race, finishing with a 25:36.6 time. He became the UAA’s fifth men’s runner to win back-to-back individual championships. The Bears had two other men’s runners in the top-10 as junior Peter Johnsrud came in fourth and senior Kirby Simon came in ninth with times of 26:12.5 and 26:27.1, respectively. Johnsburg, along with O’Gara, earned first team all-UAA honors, while Simon garnered second team honors. Graduate student Ben Rosenkranz joined Simon as a part of the all-UAA second team with an eleventh place, 26:29.1 finish. Junior Chris Blagg and sophomore Marco Quaroni rounded out the men’s top-20 finishers. On the women’s side, it was senior Alison Lindsay leading the way, notching a third place finish with a time of 23:38.0. Following her was sophomore Sophie Watterson, who finished seventh with a time 24:01.6, joining Lindsay for first team All-UAA honors. Saturday’s event was Watterson’s first ever collegiate race. “She’s done some time trials this year and we knew she was ready to run well,” Stiles said of Watterson. “The last race we had to pull the plug because of the heat, so we didn’t run a lot of our kids in the pre-national meet because it was unsafe.” Senior Audrey Western (eighth), junior Lisa Gorham (ninth) and junior Jeri Glicksman (10th) came in consecutive order following Watterson’s seventh place finish. They totaled times of 24:03.9, 24:07.4, and 24:17.7, respectively, each of them earning second team All-UAA honors.   Going forward, the varsity cross-country team will  prepare for their next race at the Midwest Regionals on Nov. 11 in Rock Island, Ill. Stiles said that much of this preparation will include recuperating from a tough weekend on the east coast.  “We’re going to ride the momentum and we’re going to recover,” Stiles said. “The kids are tired and it beat them up for sure. This week will be mostly recovery.”

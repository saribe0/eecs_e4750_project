 Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that WMT may be headed in the future. If we want to get a sense of WMT’s future performance, we have to look at the speed and size of these price movements. Using what are known as momentum indicators, we can use the stock’s price momentum to get a sense of whether the stock is in the midst of, or nearing the end of, a current trend. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for WMT is 73.29%, which suggests that the stock may be primed for a trend reversal or a corrective pullback in price. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 94.57%, tells a similar story, and suggests that WMT currently trades in overbought territory. What do the trading volumes reveal? Volume patterns can also be useful for predicting future performance. When trading activity is abnormally high, it’s often a sign that the market feels particularly strong in one way or another about the future direction of a stock. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) average trading volume of 9,472,580 during the past month is 7.33% above its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been more active than usual in the stock in recent times. What do the analysts think? WMT is currently overvalued by 1.93% relative to the average 1-year price target of $86.94 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 2.40, which implies that analysts are generally neutral in their outlook for WMT over the next year. How risky is the stock?  No study on the valuation of a stock is complete without taking into account risk. When analyzing the systematic risk associated with a stock, analysts look at beta, which measures the stock’s volatility relative to the overall market. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has a beta of 0.33, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are less extreme than the market as a whole.

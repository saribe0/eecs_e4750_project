All things considered, it’s pretty safe to say the market was underestimating Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM). Or, perhaps it would be more accurate to say investors overestimated the adverse impact hurricanes Harvey and Irma would have on the company’s operations. XOM stock edged even higher in the wake of Friday morning’s third quarter report, extending a rally that’s been building since early September. Is this the move that will get — and keep — the XOM stock price over the hump? Maybe. In some regards it’s already over the hump, though we’ve seen this before, but to no avail. The good news is that the “what” that will keep Exxon Mobil shares on the bullish side of the fence is on the verge of happening. Last quarter, Exxon Mobil turned $66.2 billion worth of revenue into a per-share profit of 93 cents, easily trouncing the year-ago top line of $56.7 billion and bottom line of 63 cents per share of XOM stock. The pros were only calling for earnings of 86 cents per share on revenue of $63.4 billion. It was a pleasant surprise, to say the least, not just because two major storms — one of which temporarily shuttered Exxon’s Baytown, Texas refinery (the nation’s second-biggest) — didn’t do the fiscal damage analysts expected, but also because the company is expanding margins without any real help from crude oil prices. Crude ended last quarter at $51.56 per barrel up from $48.24 a barrel at the end of Q3 2016. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) also delivered a similar earnings beat, though CVX stock pulled back after falling short of the profit estimate of 98 cents per share, its operating bottom line of 85 cents per share in the third quarter was still better than the year-ago’s 68 cents. Output was up 8%, year-over-year. In short, Exxon Mobil — like Chevron — is getting better at dealing with an environment of low oil prices, keeping a lid on expenses and focusing on expenditures with the best and highest-odds payoffs. As CEO Darren Woods put it, “For the fourth-consecutive quarter, we generated cash flow from operations and asset sales that more than covered our dividends and net investments in the business.” Though it’s always a moving target, the industry’s break-even price for oil has been pared down to around $50 per barrel. Crude prices are hovering just above that mark now. That’s ‘just enough.’ While most of the industry’s players can survive as long as oil prices stay above $50, surviving is hardly thriving. Though Exxon can and will continue to work towards lowering expenses, at this time, most of the potential cost-culling has been done. If XOM and its peers are to grow their bottom lines, it’s primarily going to be driven by rising oil prices.

How an investor views Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stock going forward likely depends on how that same investor sees XOM stock looking backward. The XOM stock price five years ago was $90. As of this writing, it’s $83. Is that good news? In one sense, it is. Oil prices have crashed, and yet including dividends, XOM shareholders have received a modest return over that stretch. Exxon Mobil’s diversification through chemicals and upstream businesses has protected the downside. Even a major driller like Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:APC) is down 28% over that period. Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE:CHK) stock has declined 82%, and many other hot O&G plays from 2012 have gone bankrupt in the interim. The XOM stock price may be down, but it very well could have been worse for investors bullish on oil and gas five years ago. Of course, on the other hand, XOM shareholders have missed out on substantial returns elsewhere. The S&P 500 has risen 82%, not including dividends, over those five years. Exxon’s compounded return even has (slightly) lagged that of U.S. Treasuries in the lowest interest-rate environment in U.S. history. How XOM looks at this point depends in large part on how an investor views the last five years. And it means there’s two very different ways of looking at Exxon Mobil stock. For an income investor, in particular, the past five years might look heartening. Over that five-year period, the price of oil has dropped from the high $80s to the low $50s. Natural gas prices have fallen as well. The past five years might not have been the worst-case scenario in 2012, but they’re not far off either. And yet XOM stock has satisfied two of the most important requirements of income investing, particularly for retired investors. The XOM dividend has provided 3%+ income annually, and after a recent rally investors have kept most of their principal. With the 10-year Treasury yielding just 2.4%, XOM offers more income at the moment. It might not offer the same level of safety – but the past five years show that its diversification does offer substantial protection even in a time of falling energy prices. So the case for XOM stock going forward might actually be helped by history, at least for income investors. XOM stock didn’t break at a time when most smaller energy stocks did. The diversification of retail and chemical operations has kept profits, and the share price, afloat. With the dividend yield at 3.7%, XOM still is going to provide income. And the risk posed by another leg down in energy prices seems manageable, at least if history is any indication.

Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stock flux has recently been causing stir among the investment community. Many analysts use price trends and patterns to predict future performance, and we can glean some important insights about XOM by examining the chart. How has the stock performed recently? Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) in the last month has increased +1.56%. Shares are now up over the past year, outperforming the broad market by -100% and underperformed a peer group of similar companies by -100%. After the latest session, which saw the stock close at a price of $83.47, XOM sits below its 52-week high. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has been trading in a bullish manner, based on the relative positions of the stock’s 20 and 200 day moving averages. Momentum indicators 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that XOM may be headed in the future. In order to predict this, technical analysts look at momentum indicators, which measure the speed and magnitude of these price movements. The idea is that as momentum slows, it may signal the approach of key support or resistance levels and a reversal of recent trends. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for XOM is 67.67%, which suggests that the stock is not particularly expensive or cheap, and not predisposed to a reactive price movement based on this measure. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 83.51%, tells a different story, and suggests that XOM currently trades in overbought territory. What do the trading volumes reveal? In addition to price, analysts use volume trends to predict future performance. The level of trading activity in a stock is often a good proxy for the level of interest and enthusiasm for the name within the investment community. A sudden increase in activity can be a sign that investors are trading in anticipation of a catalyst. Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) average trading volume of 7,495,915 during the past month is 32.32% below its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been less active than usual in the stock in recent times. What do the analysts think? XOM is currently overvalued by 0.08% relative to the average 1-year price target of $83.40 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 2.90, which implies that analysts are generally neutral in their outlook for XOM over the next year. How risky is the stock?  In order to put XOM’s recent price performance into context, we need to get a sense of how the stock moves in relation to the overall market. Beta, which measures a stock’s price volatility relative to the market, provides the cleanest measure of systematic risk for a stock. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has a beta of 0.83, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are less extreme than the market as a whole. XOM therefore has a below average level of market risk. During the past couple of weeks, XOM average daily volatility was 4.14%, which is 5.7 percentage points lower than the average volatility over the past 100 days.

As companies search for ways to modernize their technology stacks, they struggle with managing the legacy software (and hardware) inside their own data centers. IBM introduced a new private cloud product today that is supposed to ease the transition to cloud computing and containerization and place those legacy applications in a more modern IT management context. IBM Cloud Private wants to help customers take IBM middleware and other legacy applications, place them inside containers and transform them into contemporary applications to take advantage of containers and container orchestration run by Kubernetes — and all the flexibility that offers them. IBM isn’t alone in this approach, just the latest to offer a solution, but it’s particularly critical for a legacy vendor like IBM because the new product offers a path for maintaining older IBM middleware products like Websphere without forcing long-time customers to completely rip and replace. Of course, updating the old stuff is only part of the motivation here. It’s also about making it easier to move the cloud. The whole idea of cloud native computing is to provide a consistent way of managing your IT stack, whether your applications are in the cloud, your own data center or moving between the two. Some companies want to stay in the cozy confines of their own data centers for a variety of reasons from performance or governance to a belief that they are more secure there (whether that’s true or not). Cloud Private (and products like it) lets them do that while giving them a cloud-like management experience. Essentially, IBM wants to give IT the best of both worlds by providing a way to build APIs to connect cloud services like Salesforce with the in-house data center and share data with those legacy applications. It also enables them to to manage the legacy applications in a modern way by moving them to containers, while using Kubernetes as a management layer. Kubernetes is the open source container orchestration tool originally developed by Google. It now lives at the Cloud Native Computing Foundation and has been embraced by just about every major tech company out there from AWS to Oracle and Microsoft to VMware and Pivotal (both of which are now part of Dell-EMC) — and that’s just the most recent members. All of these companies want to bring cloud native computing to their customers, much like IBM is doing with their offering today, but IBM probably has other motivations. According to data released by Synergy Research last week, IBM remains the number three cloud infrastructure provider by virtue of its strength in private cloud services. What Synergy also finds, however is that IBM’s cloud business isn’t growing rapidly, especially compared to competitors. This product could be an attempt to exploit that position, and help grow its marketshare, while also acknowledging the need to help customers move to a more modern computing environment. If IBM’s middleware customer base is willing to take the leap, it could help achieve both goals.

Artur Marciniec - Fotolia The personal data of more than 46 million mobile phone users in Malaysia was reportedly leaked online in possibly the biggest data breach in the Southeast Asian country. Learn how security analytics is helping to keep pace with cyber threats and how it can help provide serious value to your business. You forgot to provide an Email Address.

You also agree that your personal information may be transferred and processed in the United States, and that you have read and agree to the Terms of Use and the Privacy Policy. According to Malaysian technology news website Lowyat.net, the leaked data comprised personal details such as e-mail and billing addresses as well as SIM card information of pre-paid and post-paid mobile subscribers of at least 12 telcos and mobile virtual network operators. Additionally, the personal data of users of job portal Jobstreet.com, as well as a slew of medical organisations such as the Malaysian Medical Council and the Malaysian Dental Association, was compromised. The massive data breach first came to light on October 18, when Lowyat was alerted to databases containing the leaked data that had been put up for sale for an undisclosed amount of bitcoin on its online forums. Based on the dates in the data, the breach was likely to have occurred between 2014 and 2015, according to a Lowyat report. It is uncertain how the breach occurred, though investigations by the local police are ongoing. “All aspects are still under investigation, so we do not want to make any conclusions that will only complicate the situation,” Mazlan Ismail, chief operating officer of the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC), told the Bernama news agency. Mazlan revealed the MCMC had met with the affected telcos to seek their cooperation and keep them updated on the situation. “This is to ensure that they understand what is happening now, especially when the police, through the Commercial Crime Investigation Department visit them to investigate,” he said. On its Facebook page, the MCMC had called for the public to avoid making speculations on the data breach until the authorities complete the investigations. Sanjay Aurora, Darktrace’s Asia-Pacific managing director, said this latest breach is yet another example of a ‘low and slow’ attack that stays dormant inside networks for years, without anyone noticing. “Traditional defences predicated on chasing after yesterday’s attack fail to spot and stop stealthy ‘low and slow’ attacks of this type. Lateral movements are incredibly difficult to catch, with attackers spending an average of 260 days in a network before striking,” he said. Aurora said machine learning technology that learns on the job and dynamically recalibrates assumptions in the face of new information will detect and stop similar attacks. He also called for a cultural change against widespread victim-blaming that could deter organisations from coming forward with the evidence of crimes. With mounting data breaches around the globe, Asia-Pacific countries such as Singapore and Australia are either planning to enact data breach notification requirements or have already done so. Although Malaysia has personal data protection laws that require organisations to guard the personal data of individuals against loss, misuse, modification, unauthorised or accidental access, among other obligations, it does not mandate organisations to report data breaches. Ng Kai Koon, a former director of government affairs at Symantec Asia-Pacific and Japan, had called for Malaysia to implement data breach notification rules as early as 2012, noting that this would instil consumer confidence in the country’s data protection regime in spite of the regulatory overheads and costs to businesses.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-01/adp-data-show-u-s-companies-added-235-000-jobs-in-october

Companies added more workers than forecast to U.S. payrolls in October, indicating hiring snapped back after hurricanes Harvey and Irma, according to data released Wednesday from the ADP Research Institute in Roseland, New Jersey.  The report indicates resilience in the labor market and is consistent with other data that show the economy is recovering from the tropical storms. Employment is expanding as businesses remain optimistic about the outlook, at the same time employers face the challenge of finding skilled workers as the job market is tightening. The ADP results are also a sign that the government will report Friday a rebound in private payrolls for October. The surge in construction employment probably shows greater demand for labor to rebuild homes and businesses in the hurricane-stricken areas of Texas and Florida. “Looking through the hurricane-created volatility, job growth is robust,” Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics Inc. in West Chester, Pennsylvania, said in a statement. Moody’s produces the figures with ADP. “The job market remains healthy and hiring bounced back with one of the best performances we’ve seen all year,” Ahu Yildirmaz, co-head of the ADP Research Institute, said in the statement. “We saw significant growth in professional services, especially in the higher paid professional technical jobs. Additionally, small businesses rebounded well from the impact of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, posting very strong gains."

Kitco News Share this article: (Kitco News)  - The  gold market is seeing little reaction, hovering just above session lows after  private-payrolls processor ADP reported slightly weaker-than-expected  private-sector job growth last month.
 Wednesday, ADP  said that 235,000 jobs were created in October. The report surprised to the  upside as consensus forecasts were looking for gains of around 200,000 jobs. This is the strongest report since March.
 September’s  data was revised lower with only 110,000 jobs created during the month, down  from the original report of 135,000 jobs. Spot  gold on Kitco.com was seeing modest gains ahead of the report and is down only  slightly in reaction to the data. Spot gold last traded at $1,274.80 an ounce,  up 0.35% on the day.  According to some analysts, the gold market is seeing technical short covering as it ingores the private sector employment data. Although  the ADP report was stronger than expected, economists continue to note that the  data is not a consistent predictor of Friday’s official nonfarm payrolls  numbers. However, Paul Ashworth, said that the report shows potential for the  labor market to rebound strongly in October, after sharp, weather-related  declines in September. “Given that  the official non-farm payroll tally fell by 33,000 in September, we should  perhaps expect a 378,000 (345,000 + 33,000) rebound in non-farm payrolls in  October, which is a little higher than our 350,000 estimate and the 312,000  consensus forecast,” he said.

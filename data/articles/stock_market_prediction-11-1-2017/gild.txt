Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) has put together a nice run of late. The GILD stock price today sits 24% higher than it did as recently as June, when the stock hit a three-year low. There is some good news here. As InvestorPlace’s Chris Lau pointed out, the acquisition of Kite Pharma and its CAR-T therapy makes some sense, and was met with analyst optimism. Also, InvestorPlace writer Luke Lango made a broader case for upside in the GILD stock price earlier this month. Both of my colleagues make good points  and Gilead stock looks cheap, trading at less than 11x forward EPS. But I’m not buying the rally in GILD stock. As a company, I like Gilead, and its efforts to battle hepatitis C and HIV are commendable. But as a stock, GILD isn’t as cheap as it looks, particularly when considering the broader pressure on the pharmaceutical and biotech industries. There’s one key problem that means GILD likely should only be bought at a huge discount. And I don’t think that discount is quite big enough at the moment. The approval of Yescarta, Kite’s flagship therapy, no doubt is good for GILD stock. CAR-T is a cancer treatment that uses modified versions of existing T-cells (a type of white blood cell) to create modified versions that will attack cancer cells. It’s a promising therapy — and potentially a lucrative one. As Barron’s pointed out, Kite will charge $373,000 — a huge number, but one that’s still more than $100,000 less than the existing therapy from Novartis AG (ADR) (NYSE:NVS). But from a profit standpoint, there are concerns. Notably, competition will be intense. James Brumley laid out the bull case for Juno Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:JUNO) back in August, citing its CAR-T potential. ZIOPHARM Oncology Inc. (NASDAQ:ZIOP) and bluebird bio Inc (NASDAQ:BLUE) are among myriad other smaller players working in the space. In addition, the market may not be that big — at least at first. Analyst Geoff Porges, as quoted by Barron’s, estimated just 5,300 potential patients in the U.S. That will expand over time, as the therapies improve and indications broaden. But investors expecting a major short-term profit boost from Kite will be disappointed.

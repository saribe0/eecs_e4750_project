JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) is an interesting player in the Financial space, with a focus on Money Center Banks. The stock has been active on the tape, currently trading at $101.41, down from yesterday’s close by -0.35%. Given the stock’s recent action, it seemed like a good time to take a closer look at the company’s recent data. Fundamental Analysis No amount of research is complete without a bird’s eye view of the financial data. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) currently trades with a market capitalization of $356.75 Billion. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For JPM, you can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $23.87 Billion over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to grow in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $1.7 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 76.18% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors. Technical Analysis It’s important to check the technicals to get a sense of how JPM has been acting. Looking at the stock’s movement on the chart, JPMorgan Chase & Co. recorded a 52-week high of $102.42. It is now trading 1.01% off that level. The stock is trading $94.68 its 50-day moving average by -6.73%. The stock carved out a 52-week low down at $67.64. In recent action, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) has made a move of +4.72% over the past month, which has come on weak relative transaction volume. Over the trailing year, the stock is underperforming the S&P 500 by 22.23, and it’s gotten there by action that has been more volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. In terms of the mechanics underlying that movement, traders will want to note that the stock is trading on a float of 0.78% with $3.48 Billion sitting short, betting on future declines. That suggests something of the likelihood of a short squeeze in shares of JPM.

JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) has been a major beneficiary of the stock market rally following the 2016 election. Since this time last year, shares of the New York City-based bank are up 44%. That's more than twice the S&P 500. It also comes in ahead of other large-cap banks, with the KBW Bank Index returning 38% over the same stretch. Given this performance, it's reasonable for investors to ask this question: Is JPMorgan Chase's stock cheap or expensive? Image source: Getty Images. A common way to measure a bank stock's valuation is to use the price-to-book value ratio, which is calculated by dividing a bank's share price by its book value per share. This tells you how much investors think a bank is worth relative to how much the bank purports to be worth on its balance sheet. A bank with a ratio above 1.0 is said to trade for a premium to book value. The implication is that investors think the bank will create value beyond its current net worth. Conversely, a bank that trades for less than book value per share is said to trade at a discount to book value. This implies that investors expect the bank's value to erode -- perhaps as a result of excess unrecognized loan losses. Data source: YCharts.com. Chart by author. In the case of JPMorgan Chase, its stock trades for 1.49 times its book value per share. That equates to a 49% premium to book value. Despite this, compared to other bank stocks, JPMorgan Chase stock doesn't come across as expensive. The median valuation on the KBW Bank Index is 1.41 times book value, or only eight basis points less than JPMorgan Chase. Data source: YCharts.com. Chart by author. A second way to measure a bank's valuation is to use the price-to-earnings ratio, or P/E ratio. You calculate this by dividing a bank's share price by its earnings per share. The P/E ratio reflects how much it costs an investor to buy $1 worth of a company's earnings. If the P/E ratio is 20, then it costs $20. If the ratio is 9, it costs $9. There is no general industry benchmark in terms of what constitutes a high or low P/E ratio for a bank stock. That said, one can compare a bank stock's P/E ratio to stocks that are both within the bank industry and outside of it; this is a key benefit of the P/E ratio over the price-to-book value ratio. *The median was used for the KBW Bank Index and the S&P 500. Data source: YCharts.com, The Wall Street Journal. Chart by author. In JPMorgan Chase's case, its stock trades for 14.2 times its earnings over the trailing 12 months. That compares to a median P/E ratio on the S&P 500, an index of large-cap stocks, of 23.2. The median on the KBW Bank Index is 16.8. By this measure, then, JPMorgan Chase's stock seems cheap, at least on a relative basis. While bank stocks like JPMorgan Chase may not have rich valuations right now, that doesn't mean they can't drop by a large margin; they can. One could make the argument, in fact, that stocks more broadly are in jeopardy of a correction right now, given the multiyear bull market in equities since the financial crisis. But holding all else equal, if you're going to buy a bank stock in this environment, it doesn't hurt to buy one like JPMorgan Chase, which has a reputation for being superbly managed and which trades at a reasonable valuation.

http://www.businessinsider.com/jpmorgan-says-the-next-market-correction-will-be-painful-2017-10

 JPMorgan Chase's giant corporate and investment bank â the undisputed leader on Wall Street â is beefing up risk management and hewing conservative ahead of what it anticipates will be a painful market correction in the near future. The amount of complacency in the markets is triggering red flags for Daniel Pinto, the head of JPMorgan Chase's investment bank, who recently met with research analysts from Keefe, Bruyette, and Woods. Volatility has been hovering near record lows, with markets remaining abnormally calm even in the face of turbulent geopolitical events, such as the US's escalated tensions with North Korea. One significant risk that could turn all that upside down, according to Pinto, is inflation. He told KBW that if inflation exceeds projections by investors and central bankers, that could disrupt the long bull market we've enjoyed and put a halt to the economic cycle, sending shocks through emerging markets as well. "Management is concerned about the amount of complacency in the markets and because of that the next market correction will be painful," KBW analysts wrote in a research note. KBW analysts don't think a correction is coming soon, but JPMorgan is nonetheless taking proactive measures to pare back risk, such as rejecting leveraged lending deals, even though they pass muster with guidelines from the OCC. If an ugly market correction does rear its head, KBW says JPMorgan is poised to benefit, as it will have more capacity to deploy capital than its peers and could capture more market share.

Consistently, one of the more popular stocks people enter into their stock options watchlist  at Stock Options Channel is JPMorgan Chase & Co (Symbol: JPM). So this week we highlight one interesting put contract, and one interesting call contract, from the January 2018 expiration for JPM. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting, is at the $95 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $1.33. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 1.4% return against the $95 commitment, or a 6.3% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost  ).      Selling a put does not give an investor access to JPM's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. So unless JPMorgan Chase & Co sees its shares fall 6.3% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $93.67 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $1.33 from $95), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 6.3% annualized rate of return.  makeArticleAd();  Worth considering, is that the annualized 6.3% figure actually exceeds the 2.2% annualized dividend paid by JPMorgan Chase & Co by 4.1%, based on the current share price of $101.27. And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to lose 6.32% to reach the $95 strike price.    Always important when discussing dividends is the fact that, in general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of JPMorgan Chase & Co, looking at the dividend history chart for JPM below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 2.2% annualized dividend yield.    Turning to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the January 2018 expiration, for shareholders of JPMorgan Chase & Co (Symbol: JPM) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 2.2% annualized dividend yield. Selling the covered call at the $105 strike and collecting the premium based on the $1.84 bid, annualizes to an additional 8.2% rate of return against the current stock price (this is what we at Stock Options Channel refer to as the YieldBoost  ), for a total of 10.4% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $105 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but JPM shares would have to advance 3.5% from current levels for that to occur, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 5.3% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.    The chart below shows the trailing twelve month trading history for JPMorgan Chase & Co, highlighting in green where the $95 strike is located relative to that history, and highlighting the $105 strike in red:       The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2018 put or call options highlighted in this article deliver a rate of return that represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for JPMorgan Chase & Co (considering the last 252 trading day JPM historical stock prices  using closing values, as well as today's price of $101.27) to be 17%.    In mid-afternoon trading on Monday, the put volume among S&P 500 components was 1.07M contracts, with call volume at 1.89M, for a put:call ratio of 0.57 so far for the day. Compared to the long-term median put:call ratio of .65, that represents high call volume relative to puts; in other words, buyers are showing a preference for calls in  options trading  so far today.

JPMorgan Chase‘s quarterly profit and revenue easily trumped Wall Street’s expectations on Thursday, but a slump in bond trading clouded gains from loan growth and higher interest rates. Financial market trading was again a dark spot for the bank with revenue from bond trading diving 27% compared with a year earlier, when it was boosted by higher market activity due to Brexit and the U.S. election. Equity markets revenue was also down 4%. Shares of JPMorgan  				 					 						jpm 						 					 				 			, which kicked off earnings for banks in the United States, rose 0.6% to $97.42 in premarket trading. “The results were solid but not exceptional,” said Morningstar analyst Jim Sinegal. Several large U.S. banks had warned last month that revenue from trading stocks and bonds would take a hit in the third quarter. JPMorgan‘s total markets revenue fell 21%. Chief Executive Jamie Dimon last month forecast a decline of about 20% for the quarter. But the bank’s average loan growth and higher net interest income in the third quarter helped it cushion some of blow. “The global economy continues to do well and the U.S. consumer remains healthy with solid wage growth,” Dimon said in a statement. The bank’s average loan balances in the third quarter were up 7% from a year earlier, about half the pace of growth a year-earlier. Loan growth has been anemic for U.S. banks as interest rates come off historic lows. President Donald Trump’s pro-business policies were expected to boost loan growth, but waning optimism about the administration’s ability to push through reforms has hurt growth. The bank’s total revenue rose 2.7%, topping the average analyst estimate of $25.23 billion. Net profit rose 7.1% to $6.73 billion, or $1.76 per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30. Analysts had expected earnings of $1.65 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Stock repurchases by the company during the past year under capital plans approved by the Federal Reserve boosted earnings per share. Net interest income rose 10 percent to $12.80 billion due to higher interest rates. The bank’s net interest margin increased as the interest rate it earned on average assets increased 0.37 percentage points—more than the 0.29 percentage point increase in the interest rate on its liabilities. Since the year-earlier quarter, the Fed raised overnight rates in December, March and June for a total of 0.75 percentage points. It is widely expected to hike rates again in December. Total noninterest expenses fell 1% to $14.32 billion.

By Skyler Rossi Oct. 31, 2017 The MU Sustainability Office is preparing its Sustainability Tracking, Assessment & Rating System report for 2018. In this report, the office will report MU data in order to receive a sustainability score.  According to Srinivasan Raghavan, the Sustainability Office manager, sustainability is the equilibrium of the environment, society and economics.  STARS tracks and rates participating universities’ progress toward sustainability in academics, engagement, operations, planning and administration and innovation. The overall numeric scores given to each school are then translated into awards of reporter, bronze, silver, gold or platinum. Currently, MU has a score of 65.93/100, which is equivalent to a gold standing. This was reported in 2015. “We have subscribed to STARS because we feel there is substantial student interest in sustainability,” Raghavan said. “One can only manage what one measures. We feel that if we can benchmark are our sustainability metrics we can make progress. Making progress in STARS helps us in responsible stewardship of our resources which is aligned with the mission of the University of Missouri.” The MU Sustainability Office is taking several small steps in each category to raise MU’s overall score. But with a lot to get done and not enough people to do it all, it’s been tricky. “STARS has over 60 categories,” Raghavan said. “We are a two-person office at this point.  Despite being short staffed we are making gradual progress by prioritizing areas of improvement.” Currently the office is trying to increase sustainability content within the curriculum, improve outreach, build more efficient buildings and improve recycling programs.
 “We’re making what we call gradual progress on all of these things, so we’re looking at all of them and seeing where we can improve,” Raghavan said.  Over the last several months, Raghavan has been meeting and working with several offices on campus to raise awareness and integrate sustainability into MU. These organizations include campus facilities, academic affairs, faculty and even the city of Columbia. The MU STARS 2015 report showed MU needed the most improvement in curriculum, research, buildings and energy.  The report specifically emphasized the importance of increasing sustainability programs through the curriculum.  “We were unable to claim more than 15 points in Academics, and this will take a considerable amount of time to remedy,” the 2015 report noted. “We are certain that we can improve this score by capturing all of these relevant classes, programs and other sustainable practices by implementing a central reporting system.”
 While the MU office is still trying to incorporate sustainability measures in the MU curriculum, the energy section is bound to score higher. This year, MU was named the winner of the IDEA System of the Year Award, which recognizes a school each year that has excelled at energy conservation. “Energy management at Mizzou has made great progress in spite of budget cuts,” Raghavan said. “For on-site green power generation we are among the top universities in the country.” With the help from students, faculty and staff, Raghavan and the office of sustainability hope to raise the STARS score for MU.

The world of autonomous driving is set to become a major industry, with the potential to grow massively over the next few decades. Investors have taken notice and are currently on the lookout for stocks that have exposure to the self-driving car push. Picking stocks in this industry might seem to be growth plays on their face. But not every company with ties to autonomous vehicles are set to pop. This is where picking a stock with real growth fundamentals can be fun and potentially rewarding, as it presents the possibility for massive returns. One stock that fits this mold for outside growth, based on real business segment fundamentals, is Micron Technology, Inc. MU. As a semiconductor giant, Micron markets its memory and data storage solutions to computer manufacturing firms, consumer electronics companies, and telecommunications powers. Micron has also invested heavily in vehicle safety technology that could prove to be foundational for a driverless car future. The company’s vehicle-focused semiconductor technology currently helps reduce human driving errors. This includes gesture control interfaces that help detect drowsy and distracted drivers and vehicle sensors that create more advanced computer “vision.” Along with these technologies, Micron’s artificial intelligence already helps vehicles detect and alert drivers to objects, pedestrians, and other hazards that might be in the road. Fundamentals  Micron is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that rocks an “A” grade for Growth. On top of that, Micron’s sports an overall VGM grade of an “A.” Shares of Micron have already surged over 133% during the last 52 weeks. Micron has seen its stock price climb nearly 47% in the last 12 weeks alone. It seems that this substantial stock price movement was based on Micron’s ability to grow both it top and bottom lines. At the end of September, Micron reported fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 results that climbed year-over-year. The company’s Q4 revenues skyrocketed 91%, while its full-year sales soared 64% to hit $20.32 billion. "Micron delivered exceptional fourth quarter and fiscal year results, reflecting solid execution and robust demand for our memory and storage solutions," Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said in a statement.  "We expect healthy industry fundamentals to continue into 2018, supported by increasingly diverse end markets and applications.” Investors who didn’t benefit from Micron’s substantial gains so far this year might be glad to know that the semiconductor company’s growth metrics are set to keep on climbing. Micron revenues are expected to jump nearly 60% in its current quarter, based on our current consensus estimates. The company seems set to keep on cruising as its full-year 2018 revenues are projected to climb almost 20% to hit an upward estimate of $24.20 billion. Micron Technology, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Micron Technology, Inc. Quote Micron has failed to top earnings estimates just once in the last three years, including posting beats in the last nine quarters. Within the last 60 days, Micron has earned four upward earnings estimate revisions for its current quarter. The semiconductor company also received four upward revisions, along with no downward changes, for its upcoming year. Micron’s earnings are projected to skyrocket over 574% in its current quarter. For its full fiscal year 2018, the company’s earnings are set to surge over 50% to touch as high as $7.76 per share. Bottom Line Based on Micron’s major 2017 success, its future growth projections, and its current Zacks Rank, it seems like a stock that growth investors should consider. When investors add these growth metrics and its Zacks Rank on top of the simple fact that Micron makes products that are becoming vitally important and necessary in the age of connected-products, this semiconductor memory powerhouse becomes even more eye-catching.

Rabia Gregory is an associate professor and director of graduate studies in the MU department of religious studies.  By Rabia Gregory Oct. 30, 2017 The Maneater reserves the right to edit letters and columns for style and length. I was one of many professors teaching on Oct. 19 when a strange alarm sounded down the hall and MU Alert took over my classroom computer. The message unhelpfully read: “MU Alert reports an active threat near Hitt St/Locust St http://mualert.missouri.edu for confirmed details. Only call MUPD in an emergency.” I wasn't sure what to do after reading that message. Hitt and Locust is about a 10 minute walk from my classroom, but I had none of the information I needed to make a decision about whether to evacuate the classroom, keep teaching or tell my students to shelter in place. Every time MU Alert is used it should describe the nature of the threat or recommend what recipients of the message should do to stay safe until more information is available. One of my students, Caleb Dahlgren, has been trained to respond to active shooter threats. He responded to the “active threat” as a possible active shooter event. He closed the blinds, and, with my permission, dimmed the lights and had us make a plan to defend our classroom. I recognized that his response was heightening anxiety in the room, but I had not been trained to handle an active shooter, and I would rather we be prepared than take unnecessary risks while  waiting for more information. I asked my students to monitor Twitter and the local news for me because I do not bring my phone to class. I wasn't worried about any of us being shot, but as my students read new messages to me from the MU Alert Twitter account, I became concerned for the safety of the “subject” and for every African-American woman in a Mizzou sweatshirt who matched her description. As with every MU Alert I have received so far, preparing for an active shooter event was the wrong choice. But sheltering in place was also the wrong decision. Our classroom door does not lock. The walls are not bulletproof and our interior wall is along the main corridor near the stairwell. A shooter could have sent several rounds through the wall before we saw anything or could move to defend ourselves. We were vulnerable to shrapnel and flying glass, a chemical attack, grenades or other explosives. If an armed person or group had been attacking campus, we should have evacuated to a more secure location. MU Alert is a powerful tool, but, as The Maneater has recently reported, every message it sends is written and approved by humans. Last week, someone decided to warn campus about a threat but failed to provide the information we needed to know how to respond to that threat. In my opinion, their bigger mistake was deciding that the situation even merited a campus-wide alert. Missouri is an open-carry state and it is legal to have a gun at the intersection of Hitt and Locust. We should expect that guns will be seen on or near campus, especially since there are no posted signs prohibiting guns on University grounds.  What if the nuclear reactor malfunctions, or a hazardous spill or explosion takes place in a laboratory, or an armed group launches a coordinated attack on campus? What if there is an earthquake or a tornado or a wildfire? Or another sexual assault, a suicide, a robbery? What if our campus, like other universities, faces the murderous terror of a car driving through a crowd or a lone attacker bringing a knife or gun to our campus to kill as many as possible? It is a mistake to assume that events like these can’t happen here. Whatever the threat, we will need to know the nature of the threat to be able to respond correctly. Unfortunately, if MU Alert continues to be used like it was last week, no amount of training can keep us safe.

https://investorplace.com/2017/10/micron-technology-inc-mu-stock-einhorn/

Chip maker Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) has seen its stock price rise nearly 200% since the start of 2016, as the company has found itself in the sweet spot of robust demand and constrained supply. But MU stock has just bounced around the $40 level for most of October. Is this sideways trading simply a pause in a big rally or an indication that $40 is the mountaintop for MU stock? I think it’s the former. The current dynamics of robust DRAM demand fueled by smartphones and data centers and constrained supply due to limited suppliers and heightened product complexity will continue to boost profit margins for Micron into the foreseeable future. Some day, supply will inflect dramatically upward or demand will inflect dramatically downward, and that will kill MU stock. But that day is not today. Here’s why. Bulls just received some big public support from hedge fund titan, David Einhorn. The hedge fund manager recently disclosed that his Greenlight Capital fund made three new investments in the third quarter of 2017. One of those investments was MU stock. It’s important to note here that Einhorn isn’t the type of investor who jumps on the momentum train. He is a value guy who often places bets against momentum. He is (in)famous for shorting Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA). It’s rather bullish, then, to see such a value-oriented investor who doesn’t like strong momentum names get on board with MU stock, which is up 200% in less than two years and is in the middle of what many consider a bubble. Einhorn doesn’t buy the bubble talk. He thinks that because DRAM is starting to reach its lower limit in terms of size, pricing has stopped falling and will remain stable into the foreseeable future. Meanwhile, demand is ramping up thanks to data centers and smartphones. Diversified demand streams shield MU from harsh cyclical pullbacks in demand. Plus, Einhorn likes the fact that Micron stock trades at just five times this year’s earnings estimate. Overall, it’s bullish to see one of Wall Street’s most-followed value-oriented hedge fund managers bite into Micron at a time when bears are screaming “bubble.” I continue to believe Micron will trend toward $50. Fiscal 2018 earnings will represent peak earnings for MU. Supply will begin to ramp up in 2019 as new fabs start to hit the market. Thus, gradual volume expansion in 2019 will slowly eat into Micron’s profit margins. Demand will remain high, but lower profit margins will cause earnings to fall.

Fight to the finish Former vice-chancellor Dr. Balchandra Mungekar (seated) joins protesters in shouting slogans outside the Mumbai University campus in Kalina on Tuesday.

   Mumbai: A group comprising students, parents, former vice-chancellors, politicians and members of unions affiliated to political parties, protested outside the Mumbai University campus in Kalina on Tuesday and demanded that no exams be held till the pending 2,600 results are declared. The protest was led by Dr. Balchandra Mungekar, former vice-chancellor of the varsity and member of the Union Planning Commission. Dr. Mungekar said that the university should not conduct the exams scheduled for November and December till the pending answer sheets are evaluated and the results declared.  Dr. Mungekar said, “If the university is unable to declare results, then all students should be granted 50% marks. The exams scheduled for the calendar year should not be affected.”  The protesters also claimed that the university should not conduct online assessments for upcoming exams. They said that online assessments should be implemented in a phased manner and teachers and principals should be taken into confidence. The protesters claimed that the university was tainting its reputation and obstructing its functioning by treating the teaching fraternity shabbily. Dr. Mungekar said, “We have nothing against online assessments as it is a transparent system. However, it is impractical to entrust a single firm with assessing the answer sheets of 477 examinations. Over five lakh students appear for these exams and over 22 lakh answer books, each comprising 20 pages, have to be evaluated. How can a single company scan and upload 4.4 crore pages?” The former vice-chancellor questioned how a single company was awarded the contract to undertake online assessments without tenders being invited. Dr. Mungekar said, “Who cleared the contract and under which budgetary provisions will the money be cleared?” The protesters put forward their demands to senior officials of the university as acting vice-chancellor Dr. Devanand Shinde was away in Kolhapur on a personal visit. The protesters claimed that meritorious students suffered when examiners randomly allotted average marks to declare results. Sachin Pawar, president of the Students’ Law Council, said, “We will soon start a bigger agitation and won’t withdraw it till our demands are met. The State government is yet to notice the power of students. When they sense our anger, they will heed to our demands.” Mr. Pawar has written to Governor Ch.Vidyasagar Rao to fill up the vacant posts of vice-chancellor, registrar and the controller of examinations at the university. He said, “Most higher officials in the university have been posted on a temporary basis. There are no officials to hear us out and take proper decisions. Around 3,000 answer sheets have gone missing and no action has been taken. The demand to reduce exam fees is the only one that has been accepted so far.”

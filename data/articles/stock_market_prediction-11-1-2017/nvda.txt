  Nvidia's stock is rising after the company announced it has partnered with several artificial intelligence companies to expand its efforts to train new AI researchers. Nvidia is up 1.30% to $206.50 on Tuesday after announcing an expansion of its Deep Learning Institute. The company's Deep Learning Institute is an initiative to train as many people as possible in AI programming and research. Nvidia announced a partnership on Tuesday with Booz Allen Hamilton, a government consulting firm, and Deeplearning.ai, an online training company, to broaden its institute's reach. “The world faces an acute shortage of data scientists and developers who are proficient in deep learning, and we’re focused on addressing that need,” Greg Estes, vice president at Nvidia, said in a news release. Nvidia has been working on artificial intelligence for years, and has recently emerged as one of the leading providers of the hardware chips and software platforms used in AI applications. The company's graphics processing units help speed up the training of AI systems while its CUDA software is one of the many platforms helping researchers with the development of their AI programs.

NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) is an interesting player in the Technology space, with a focus on Semiconductor – Specialized. The stock has been active on the tape, currently trading at $203.84, up from yesterday’s close by 0.98%. Given the stock’s recent action, it seemed like a good time to take a closer look at the company’s recent data. Fundamental Analysis No amount of research is complete without a bird’s eye view of the financial data. NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) currently trades with a market capitalization of $118.57 Billion. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For NVDA, the company currently has $1.99 Billion of cash on the books, which is offset by $89 Million current liabilities. You can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $1.97 Billion over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to grow in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $0.94 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 66.37% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors. Technical Analysis As most professionals know, technical analysis can offer critical insights into what smart money and insiders think about a stock’s prospects going forward. Looking at the stock’s movement on the chart, NVIDIA Corporation recorded a 52-week high of $201.87. It is now trading -1.97% off that level. The stock is trading $179.93 its 50-day moving average by -23.91%. The stock carved out a 52-week low down at $66.57. In recent action, NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) has made a move of +13.88% over the past month, which has come on weak relative transaction volume. Over the trailing year, the stock is underperforming the S&P 500 by 22.23, and it’s gotten there by action that has been more volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. In terms of the mechanics underlying that movement, traders will want to note that the stock is trading on a float of 2.56% with $573.18 Million sitting short, betting on future declines. That suggests something of the likelihood of a short squeeze in shares of NVDA.

Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) continues its red-hot performance. NVDA stock is one of the biggest winners on the Nasdaq for 2017. Shares are up 171% over the past year, and 83% 2017 year-to-date alone. Anyone skeptical of NVDA stock, including this author on occasion, has looked rather foolish. However, stock price isn’t always tied to business performance. In the case of NVDA stock, investors have bid it up far in excess of any reasonable valuation given the current balance of risk and reward. For NVDA stock to continue producing sizzling returns, just about everything has to go right for the company. The phrase “priced for perfection” was invented for situations like the one we see with Nvidia today. The story with NVDA stock starts at its frenetic earnings growth in recent quarters. Bulls can point to NVDA earnings with pride, it’s been one of the best stories of the year so far. The company has grown earnings by a rather astounding 137% over the past year. For the first half of 2017, compared to 2016, revenue climbed 53%, free cash flow generation by 17%, and net income by 125%. Those are amazing numbers, though net income and earnings are clearly running ahead of actual sales and cash flow, powered by improving margins and mix. All five of Nvidia’s product categories showed year-over-year growth. Only professional visualization came in under 10% growth; the other four segments all grew by at least 20%. Assuming full-year 2017 estimates are achieved, auto revenues will be up almost 5x since 2014, data center up 4x, and gaming up almost 3x. That’s some pretty heady stuff. Unfortunately, Nvidia’s growth rate is set for a serious slowdown. Analyst consensus has earnings rising from 3.49 over the past 12 months to just 4.02 next year. The company is heading for less than 20% growth next year, and analysts peg the five-year compounded growth rate going forward at just 13%. That’d put earnings in 2022 around seven bucks a share, which is nowhere near enough to justify a $200 stock price today. Sure, you can say, analysts are probably sandbagging. Nvidia tends to beat guidance when reporting quarterly results. But even assuming they beat guidance comfortably, it’s still hard to justify anything close to the current price. Given the relatively slow rate of EPS growth for the current year, the P/E ratio will barely budge. NVDA stock is at 56x PE now and is expected to fall to just 49x in 2018. Why is earnings growth slowing down so dramatically? Here’s some real NVDA news that many folks tend to gloss over. It’s worth remembering that Nvidia generates close to 70% of its revenues from gaming and professional visualization. The gaming division has benefited from the launch of a bunch of new cards. That pulled forward demand, but don’t expect that sales momentum to continue let alone accelerate. And Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) will almost certainly hit back with new graphics cards launches of their own to try to take back share from Nvidia. Nvidia has also profited from card sales due to the boom in Bitcoin, Ethereum and other such cryptocurrencies. However, logic dictates these markets will slow down sooner or later. Already, as part of AMD’s earnings miss recently, they conceded that mining card demand is “leveling off.” That as cryptocoins continue to soar. What happens to this source of demand once Bitcoin prices stall out, let alone correct sharply?

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) gained 0.98% in yesterday’s session, going up from its prior closing price of $201.86 to $203.84, and has now recorded rally in 4 consecutive sessions. Many in the market will be closely watching whether this winning streak is sustainable or take a temporary pause for the next couple of trading sessions. The price has been moving in both directions for this period, and there has been a 2.99% gain over 10-day period. Trading activity decreased by -1.67 million shares, and in total, 12.58 M shares exchanged hands for about $2 563.73 million. It should be noted that increasing price and decreasing volume show lack of interest and this is a warning that something has fundamentally changed. Inside NVDA’s Recent Trend NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) lies in the upper part of a wide and strong rising trend in the short term, and this will normally pose a very good selling opportunity for the short-term trader as reaction back towards the lower part of the trend can be expected. A break-up at the top trend line at $208.16 will firstly indicate a stronger raising rate. Short-term traders are predicted to see a rally of 22.94% over the course of a quarter and, with 90% chance the price will be floating in the range of $228.10 and $255.91 in this timeframe. NVIDIA Corporation Technical Signals 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 NVDA has witnessed its long term and short term MA triggering a buy signal. Many traders watch for short-term averages to cross above long-term averages to signal the beginning of a uptrend. Upon corrections, the price will meet support from the averages between $198.18 and $186.10. A break down through these support points will trigger sell signals. Its pivot point low generated buy signal on Wednesday October 25, 2017, which calls for additional surge until the stock forms a new pivot point high. There was a decrease in volume but the price rose. This is usually not interpreted as a good sign as traders widely believe falling volume should see declining stock. Investors should be watching the price action like a hawk in the coming sessions. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Support And Resistance Levels In case of pullback, the next support the price will capture from accumulated volume will not be far away from current price at $187.55 and $180.11. It seems to be blessed by the accumulated volume as it meets no resistance above current level and favorable trading conditions will help the stock to show strong performance in the coming days. 
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 It is important to note, however, that the stock needs to make its way through natural risk while testing a key support level. Once this support is broken, another support level will be to be established at a lower level. Turning back to this stock, NVIDIA Corporation approaches the first support point just current price at $187.55. In case of a break, the next support we will see from accumulated volume is going to be at $180.11 and $155.96. NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Risk Assessment A volatility based measure Bollinger Bands suggests this stock poses high risk. In the most recent session, the stock price hovered around $4.87 between high and low, or 2.42%. The average volatility for the past week stood at 2.38%.

U.S. stock futures are trading broadly higher this morning, placing the major market indices on course for solid October gains. Attention turns this morning toward economic data, with the Federal Reserve kicking off its two-day policy meeting and house prices and consumer sentiment data on tap later this morning. As for October gains, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up more than 4% on the month, with the S&P 500 Index adding about 2% and the Nasdaq Composite poised for an October gain of just over 3%. As for today’s trading, futures on the Dow are up 0.12%, S&P 500 futures have added 0.16% and Nasdaq-100 futures are rolling with a gain of 0.25%. On the options front, volume fell overall on Monday, but still remained well above October’s average. Overall, about 16.1 million calls and 13.3 million puts crossed the tape yesterday. On the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio jumped to 0.69 amid yesterday’s selling, though the 10-day moving average held firm at 0.65. Taking a closer look at Monday’s options activity, General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) put volume jumped again after Fitch Ratings lowered its issuer default rating to negative. Elsewhere, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) call options flew in the face of a bearish cryptocurrency report, while Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) continued to draw optimism ahead of next week’s quarterly report.  GE has brought a lot of bad things to light in the past year, with quite a few skeletons emerging in the past couple of weeks — including a “shadow jet” for former CEO Jeff Immelt that GE’s board knew nothing about. Adding to GE stock’s misery, Fitch Ratings downgraded the company’s issuer default rating to negative from stable yesterday citing “several areas of concern” in the company’s most recent quarterly earnings report. GE stock hit a fresh 52-week low as a result, prompting options traders to pile into puts in anticipation of additional declines. Volume rose to 473,000 contracts on Monday, with puts gobbling up 56% of the day’s take. The result of the recent attention to GE puts is a rising November put/call open interest ratio, which currently rests at 1.29. The most heavily targeted November put strikes, the $23 and $22, with more than 120,000 contracts each, are now trading firmly in the money. Meanwhile, both the $19 and $20 strikes are gaining momentum, with 25,000 and 50,000 contracts in residence, respectively. A breach of $20 for GE could see the shares dip into the teens before bargain hunters finally emerge to scoop the shares out of the rubble.

Meanwhile, both the $19 and $20 strikes are gaining momentum, with 25,000 and 50,000 contracts in residence, respectively. A breach of $20 for GE could see the shares dip into the teens before bargain hunters finally emerge to scoop the shares out of the rubble.

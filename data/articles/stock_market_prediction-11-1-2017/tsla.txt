 @FredericLambert Tesla (TSLA) is set to release its third quarter 2017 financial results on Wednesday, November 1 after market close. As usual, the release of the results will be followed by a conference call and Q&A with Tesla’s management at 2:30pm Pacific Time (5:30pm Eastern Time). Here we take a look at what both the street and retail investors are expecting for the quarterly result.

(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Deliveries The third quarter 2017 was Tesla’s first for Model 3 production and deliveries, albeit still only to Tesla employees, family members of employees, and company insiders. The automaker was also plagued with “production bottlenecks” during the early production process, which led to only 220 Model 3 deliveries. Despite the low volume of Model 3 deliveries, Tesla delivered a record number of vehicles during the third quarters:  26,150 vehicles. Tesla delivered 14,065 Model S sedans and 11,865 Model X SUVs:  It’s a new record global delivery number for Model X – beating the previous record in Q1 2017 by over 300 units. As for Model S, it’s the third highest number for Model S delivered, which shows that the launch of Model 3 had a minimal impact on deliveries so far. Tesla generally adjusts those numbers slightly during the earnings results. Revenue Wall Street’s revenue consensus is $2.919 billion for the quarter and Estimize, the financial estimate crowdsourcing website, predicts almost the same result: $2.956 billion in revenue. The record delivery number for Model S and Model X resulted in this increase on the results quarter-to-quarter from Tesla’s actual revenue of $2.790 billion during the last quarter. It’s also a significant increase year-over-year from $2.298 billion in revenue in Q3 2016. The predictions for Tesla’s revenue over the past 2 years – Estimize predictions in blue – Wall Street consensus in grey – Actual results in green:  Tesla has been on a good streak – beating revenue expectations every quarter for the past 5 quarters now, but expectations are higher this time around due to record deliveries. Earnings Earnings per share, or rather loss per share, is expected to plunge for the quarter. Like for revenue, the expectations are again close for both the street and retail investors. The Wall Street consensus is a loss of $2.45 per share for the quarter, while Estimize’s prediction is a loss $2.25 per share. Earnings per share over the last 2 years – Estimize predictions in blue – Wall Street consensus in grey – Actual results in green:    As you can see, earnings have been more of a wild card for Tesla. A more important loss is expected this quarter as the start of Model 3 production without significant deliveries will put pressure on the company’s financials. Other expectations for the shareholders letter and analyst call Obviously, we expect that a fair amount of the conference call and shareholders letter to revolve around Model 3 production and how it has evolved since the end of the quarter. Recent reports suggested that the bottlenecks were at the Fremont factory, where Model 3 is being built and assembled, and another report said that the production bottlenecks are due to suppliers. Last week, Tesla CEO Elon Musk hinted that there might be issues at Tesla’s Gigafactory in Nevada, where the Model 3 battery pack and drive unit are being manufactured. Investors and analysts will be looking for Musk to clarify the situation. As for Model 3 reservation holders, the deadline for the first regular customer deliveries is today. It looks like we will be looking for an updated timeline here. Shareholders will also be looking for updates on the launch of Tesla’s solar products under its own brand as it started phasing out SolarCity. It’s always hard to estimate the volume from Tesla’s energy division, but there has been evidence that Powerwall 2 installations finally started to accelerate and the company also had several commercial projects with Powerpacks. They also installed a few more solar roof tile installations at employee homes. Tesla’s leadership is likely to also give an update on the status of those more recent product programs. Join us on Electrek on Wednesday after market close for our report on the results and shareholders letter. You can stick around after for the conference call with management at 2:30pm Pacific Time (5:30pm Eastern Time) and you can join on the call through Tesla’s investor relations website. Tesla is a transportation and energy company. It sells vehicles under its 'Tesla Motors' division and stationary battery pack for home, commercial and utility-scale projects under its 'Tesla Energy' division.

Tesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) Waterfall of Misses… $TSLA Production layoffs in Q-3, reports of hand assembly and Model 3 scaling concerns justified UBS’s Bearishness on Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA). Considering Tesla’s continuing announced production misses, compounded by a decrease in Zero-emission vehicle credits and lower Model S and X margins, UBS expects a Q-3 gross margins hit to cut sequential EPS (earnings per share) from -1.33 to -2.20. Poor fixed cost absorption ahead of Model 3 ramping will only intensify the losses at this rentier concern. Tesla’s CEO, Elon Musk, promised 1,500 Model 3’s in Q-3 but turned out only 220 due to production bottlenecks. “Not only does the miss undermine the credibility of future Model 3 targets, but it increases the near term risks,” the UBS analyst wrote. Anticipating Model 3 production misses of 11,000 in Y 2017, 65,000 in Y 2018 and 40,000 in Y 2019, UBS lowered respective EPS estimates from -5.30 to -6.40, -1.60 to -3.30 and 0.20 to -1.00 Continued delays may yield more long-term losses as the roll-out of rival EVs force market-share concession. UBS forecasts $900-M in Q-3 cash burn, comparable to last Quarter’s $1-B and indicative of a burn rate that would sustain Tesla for about 4 Quarters. Considering the stock’s 50% YTD run reflective of a successful Y 2017 production timeline, the firm maintains a Sell rating with a 185 price target. All of my Key indicators for TSLA have turned Very Bearish and our target has been move South from 200 to 150. Tesla burns cash does not product cars.

  Tesla    (   TSLA    ) is set to report quarterly results after the market close   Wednesday, with Wall Street analysts looking for answers on   several topics of concern. [ibd-display-video id=2462120 width=50 float=left   autostart=true] Perhaps the biggest question concerns the production ramp up   of its new car, the Model 3 - Tesla's first car targeted at a   mass audience. The Model 3 went into production in August but   missed third-quarter production targets by a wide margin.makeArticleAd(); Tesla said it rolled out 220 Model 3 sedans in the third   quarter but had planned to produce 1,500 in September alone. "Not only does the miss undermine the credibility of future   Model 3 targets, but it increases the near-term risks," wrote UBS   analyst Colin Langan in a research note to clients on Monday.   "Moreover, competing electric vehicles are coming, and a long   delay could reduce Tesla's market share opportunity." Langan has a sell rating on Tesla and price target of 185. JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman last week slashed his   fourth-quarter Model 3 delivery estimate to 15,000 cars from   30,000, "given the slower-than-expected progress in ramping the   vehicle in the third quarter," he wrote in a research note to   clients. Tesla will report third-quarter results after the market close   Wednesday, with investors wanting to know if the maker of   all-electric vehicles has worked out the kinks in Model 3   production. The consensus estimate is for revenue of $2.9   billion, up 26% from the year-ago period. The consensus on   adjusted earnings, as polled by Zacks Investment Research, is a   loss of $2.45 a share, vs. a profit of 71 cents a year ago. Tesla recently said that reservations for the Model 3 have   grown to more than 500,000, up from the 373,000 that Tesla   previously reported in the spring of 2016. Tesla shares are down about 18% from its record high of 389.61   set on Sept. 18, due to concerns about Model 3 production,   workforce restructuring and concerns that Tesla's development of   self-driving cars is sputtering.

The price of Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) over the past year has increased 60.06% while the S&P 500 has increased 20.80%. During the past 20 days, TSLA has decreased -6.28% while the broad market has increased 1.76%. TSLA ‘s 20-day moving average currently sits above its 100-day moving average. This is a bullish signal that suggests the stock price might continue to rise. TSLA’s average trading volume during the past 20 days is higher than the average volume over the past 100 days, which could be an indication that investors are feeling more certain than usual about the direction of TSLA’s future price movements. Recent trading patterns in the stock of Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) have investors on high alert. Analysts often look at historical trading patterns to predict a stock’s future performance. In the case of TSLA, the data might be telling investors a thing or two about where the stock is headed. In the most recent quarter, institutional ownership decreased by a net of 10.58 million shares, or 11.15%.This is a bearish sign and indicates that institutions are feeling more pessimistic about the outlook for TSLA overall.387 holders increased their positions, 268 decreased their positions, and 125 holders held their positions. Among institutions that increased their positions, 129 were new positions. Among holders that decreased their positions, 63 sold out of the stock Tesla, Inc.. Insider ownership during the latest quarter decreased by a net of 48928 shares, indicating that TSLA’s key executives are feeling more bearish about the stock than they did three months ago. 2 or 20% of the trades during the past quarter were buys, and 8 or 80% were sells. Insider ownership during the last year has increased by a net of 2.23 million shares. 26.79% of insider trades in the last 12 months were buys, and 73.21% were sells.

 Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) has a 20-day RSI of 36.29%. According to this momentum indicator, a reading between 30 and 70 suggests the stock is not especially cheap or expensive, and not on the brink of a trend reversal. The MACD tells a different story. TSLA’s 9-day MACD currently sits above the 20-day MACD, indicating that TSLA’s downside momentum has increased during the last three weeks. This suggests that the trend will likely continue. TSLA’s average trading volatility during the past few weeks is -19.08% lower than the average volatility over the past 100 days. This means that the stock’s daily price swings have been less extreme in recent times compared to the past. Analysts expect Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) to generate earnings per share of $9.53 in 2017. This works out to an increase of 83.62% compared to last year’s earnings. For comparison’s sake, analysts expect the S&P 500 to grow earnings by an average of 12% in 2017. The average investment rating for TSLA on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong sell and 5 being a strong buy) is a 3.18 or a Hold. Three months ago, analysts assigned TSLA a 3.14 rating, which implies that analysts have become more optimistic about the outlook for the stock over the next year.

In June, I discussed the reasons why I thought Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) could hit $1,000. At the time, TSLA stock was trading around $360. Since then it’s taken a small step backward.  I gave what I thought was an honest analysis of what has to go right for TSLA to hit one million vehicles produced annually by 2020; should the company do that, hitting $1,000 is anything but impossible—but it has to get to a million.  Nearing the end of October, Tesla’s got 38 months to hit that production number. To hit $1,000, TSLA stock has to grow at 43% compounded annually over the next three years; a 48% return in 2018 would get it to $500. A 48% decline would drag it down to $176, but I’ve rounded it up to $200 for simplicity’s sake. Which does TSLA stock hit in 2018? $200 or $500? The heavy hitter wrote a very unflattering letter to clients Oct. 24 about Tesla. Of course, what’s Einhorn going to say when he’s got a significant short position in the company’s stock. In August I acknowledged Einhorn’s short, concluding my article by suggesting that Tesla’s stock would be overvalued if it doesn’t hit monthly production of 20,000 Model 3s by the end of the year. “The Wall Street Journal reported that the much-hyped Model 3 was indeed in production — by hand,” wrote InvestorPlace’s Lawrence Meyers discussing Tesla’s instance valuation recently. “Another source even says that the Model 3 is still being developed. Wasn’t this the car Musk said would be delivered in 2016?” That doesn’t sound like a company ready to produce 20,000 vehicles per anytime soon, does it? Einhorn certainly doesn’t think so. “Given the performance of certain stocks, we wonder if the market has adopted an alternative paradigm for calculating equity value,” wrote Einhorn in his letter to clients. “What if equity value has nothing to do with current or future profits and instead is derived from a company’s ability to be disruptive…?” That describes Tesla to a tee.  Unfortunately, David, the value placed on any stock is merely a number both the buyer and seller can agree to. One man’s gold is another man’s garbage; Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, yadda, yadda, yadda.    Bottom line: Einhorn might be right that TSLA stock isn’t worth the paper it’s written on but until a majority of investors come to this conclusion, TSLA will continue to trend higher.

http://www.nasdaq.com/article/tesla-tsla-3rd-quarter-earnings-what-to-expect-cm869233

Tesla earnings (Shutterstock photo) Tesla (TSLA), which has ambitions of being more mainstream, will report third quarter fiscal 2017 earnings results after Wednesday's closing bell. But investors would feel much better if the luxury electric vehicle company had ambitions of being more profitable. Tesla shares have taken a massive beating over the past couple of weeks, falling as much as 18% from its all-time high of $386.99 reached in June to a recent low of $316.66 — the stock’s lowest level since early August. A combination of factors has impacted TSLA stock. But the biggest concern rests with Tesla’s money-making capabilities, particularly as it relates its highly-anticipated Model 3 sedan — the company’s first attempt at producing a mass market electric vehicle. Tesla reportedly spends some $80,000 to build each Model 3, which will retail for $35,000 — or about half the price of Tesla's next-cheapest car, the Model S. The company believes the lower price point would enable it to emerge from a niche market to better compete with Detroit heavyweights General Motors (GM) and Ford (F). On Wednesday the Street will want to get a sense of not only how realistic Tesla’s Model 3 delivery goals are, but also how much cash it will take to meet those goals. Earlier this month the company spooked investors when announcing that its third-quarter Model 3 delivery totals would be 220 vehicles. Though that marked a 4.5% increase year over year, it’s below the 1,260 vehicles analysts expected and well below the company’s year-end production targets of 20,000 Model 3s a month by December. On Friday analysts at Evercore downgraded TSLA stock from Buy to Neutral, advising their clients to be “more cautious” on Model 3 production. The Model 3 is “the most important piece of the Tesla investment story in coming quarters,” Evercore warned. In terms of overcoming production hiccups, which CEO Elon Musk recently described at “manufacturing hell,” Evercore noted, “We suspect that Tesla won’t have 100% visibility on the ramp until they hit more than 1,000 Model 3 units per week.” As such, the firm reduced its price target on TSLA stock to $312, from $330, implying a 3% downside to Friday’s closing price of $320.87. In the three months that ended September, Wall Street expects the Palo Alto, Calif.-based company to post a per-share loss of $2.29 on revenue of $2.94 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when the company lost 71 cents per share on $2.3 billion in revenue. For the full year, ending in December, the loss is expected to be $6.67 per share, compared to a loss of $2.87 a year ago, while full-year revenue of $11.84 billion would rise 69.2% year over year. All told, with the 1,000 Model 3 units per week benchmark expected to be reached toward the end of November, Tesla has a lot to prove Wednesday if it wants to keep its shares from driving in reverse. From my vantage point, however, these shares, which I now own, are not as risky as they were three months ago. I’ve said this before, Tesla’s main problem — if you can call it that — is that the company must overcome too much demand for its products. And that’s a business I want a piece of.

Throughout the time that I’ve been covering Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), the calls seem to be straightforward. Not only has the TSLA stock price soared in recent years, the bullishness is justified. CEO Elon Musk is a genius, constantly pushing boundaries and paving the way for the technology of tomorrow. That he’s so young implies that we’re going to see plenty of Tesla-generated news. Yet despite TSLA stock gaining slightly over 50% this year, investors are right to be worried. Between August through the middle of October, shares did virtually nothing. Over the past few days, TSLA shed nearly 11% of value in the markets. Halloween came early for Tesla, with the share price barely straddling its 200 day moving average. While I still believe that Tesla is one of the companies of the future, you must always respect the markets. Here, the signals for the TSLA stock price are pretty obvious. As previously mentioned, shares were moving sideways for a few months, making it extremely difficult for analysts to call. But with TSLA moving so firmly downward, the next few sessions will be critical. Although the company has come back from sharp corrections before (see the first quarter of 2016), I’d wait out this present bearish trend. Investors are reacting poorly to the TSLA stock price failing to breach the $390 level twice this year; once in late June and the other in mid-September. Under such circumstances, it’s probably better to wait before buying back in. But when will that buyback period occur? I have to caution readers that bullish investors may need to be more patient than they anticipate. As our own Will Ashworth stated earlier this year, a $1,000 TSLA stock price is within the realm of possibility. Its market capitalization already exceeds Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) and is steadily approaching General Motors Company (NYSE:GM). Better yet, Tesla has the kind of social cache that Ford and GM lack. However, in order for TSLA stock to hit this lofty target, Tesla has to move its production line. That’s been a big question considering the ambiguity surrounding the upcoming Model 3, an event that inspired famed fund manager David Einhorn’s short position. Ashworth writes: “In August I acknowledged Einhorn’s short, concluding my article by suggesting that Tesla’s stock would be overvalued if it doesn’t hit monthly production of 20,000 Model 3s by the end of the year.” Next Page Article printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2017/11/tsla-stock-give-up/. ©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC

					Posted by Anthony Sawyer on Nov 1st, 2017 // No Comments  Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) had its target price trimmed by Evercore ISI from $330.00 to $312.00 in a research report sent to investors on Sunday morning. The firm currently has an outperform rating on the electric vehicle producer’s stock.  “important piece” of the bullish, but a cautious view is now warranted, Galliers wrote in the downgrade note. Specifically, it is clear that production of the Model 3 sedan in the third quarter was weaker than expected with 260 units produced as opposed to an original target of slightly more than 1,500 units.At this point, there is no indication of whether Tesla fixed whatever production issues it may have had. Investors may need to wait for clarity on the company’s third-quarter earnings report on Nov. 1, the analyst wrote. As a best-case scenario, Tesla’s management team would say that production of the Model 3 is an “S-Curve” and hasn’t changed substantially.However, a more likely scenario to play out would be Tesla’s management unable to have 100 percent visibility on the Model 3 ramp until it is able to produce more than one thousand cars a week — which is unlikely to happen until the end of November.”In the meantime, we urge caution on 3rd party interpretations of 20 second Instagram feeds from CEO Elon Musk,,” Evercore ISI’s analyst wrote. Several other analysts also recently weighed in on TSLA. Vetr raised shares of Tesla from a sell rating to a hold rating and set a $361.37 price target for the company in a research note on Monday, July 3rd. Zacks Investment Research raised shares of Tesla from a strong sell rating to a hold rating in a research note on Tuesday, July 4th. Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (The)  reaffirmed a sell rating and set a $180.00 price target (down previously from $190.00) on shares of Tesla in a research note on Wednesday, July 5th. Guggenheim  reaffirmed a buy rating and set a $430.00 price target (up previously from $380.00) on shares of Tesla in a research note on Wednesday, July 5th. Finally, Robert W. Baird  reaffirmed an outperform rating and set a $368.00 price target on shares of Tesla in a research note on Wednesday, July 5th. Ten investment analysts have rated the stock with a sell rating, eleven have assigned  a hold rating and eleven have assigned  a buy rating to the company. Tesla presently has an average rating of Hold and an average price target of $332.78. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) opened at 331.53 on Friday. The stock’s market cap is $55.33 billion.

Tesla earnings (Shutterstock photo) Tesla (TSLA), which has ambitions of being more mainstream, will report third quarter fiscal 2017 earnings results after Wednesday's closing bell. But investors would feel much better if the luxury electric vehicle company had ambitions of being more profitable. Tesla shares have taken a massive beating over the past couple of weeks, falling as much as 18% from its all-time high of $386.99 reached in June to a recent low of $316.66 — the stock’s lowest level since early August. A combination of factors has impacted TSLA stock. But the biggest concern rests with Tesla’s money-making capabilities, particularly as it relates its highly-anticipated Model 3 sedan — the company’s first attempt at producing a mass market electric vehicle. Tesla reportedly spends some $80,000 to build each Model 3, which will retail for $35,000 — or about half the price of Tesla's next-cheapest car, the Model S. The company believes the lower price point would enable it to emerge from a niche market to better compete with Detroit heavyweights General Motors (GM) and Ford (F). On Wednesday the Street will want to get a sense of not only how realistic Tesla’s Model 3 delivery goals are, but also how much cash it will take to meet those goals. Earlier this month the company spooked investors when announcing that its third-quarter Model 3 delivery totals would be 220 vehicles. Though that marked a 4.5% increase year over year, it’s below the 1,260 vehicles analysts expected and well below the company’s year-end production targets of 20,000 Model 3s a month by December. On Friday analysts at Evercore downgraded TSLA stock from Buy to Neutral, advising their clients to be “more cautious” on Model 3 production. The Model 3 is “the most important piece of the Tesla investment story in coming quarters,” Evercore warned. In terms of overcoming production hiccups, which CEO Elon Musk recently described at “manufacturing hell,” Evercore noted, “We suspect that Tesla won’t have 100% visibility on the ramp until they hit more than 1,000 Model 3 units per week.” As such, the firm reduced its price target on TSLA stock to $312, from $330, implying a 3% downside to Friday’s closing price of $320.87. In the three months that ended September, Wall Street expects the Palo Alto, Calif.-based company to post a per-share loss of $2.29 on revenue of $2.94 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when the company lost 71 cents per share on $2.3 billion in revenue. For the full year, ending in December, the loss is expected to be $6.67 per share, compared to a loss of $2.87 a year ago, while full-year revenue of $11.84 billion would rise 69.2% year over year. All told, with the 1,000 Model 3 units per week benchmark expected to be reached toward the end of November, Tesla has a lot to prove Wednesday if it wants to keep its shares from driving in reverse. From my vantage point, however, these shares, which I now own, are not as risky as they were three months ago. I’ve said this before, Tesla’s main problem — if you can call it that — is that the company must overcome too much demand for its products. And that’s a business I want a piece of.

  Tesla Inc. TSLA  is set to report third-quarter 2017 results after market close on Nov 1. Last quarter, the electric car maker saw an earnings beat of 31.4%.  makeArticleAd();  In the trailing four quarters, the company beat and missed estimates twice each, resulting in an average negative earnings surprise of 77.4%.   Let us see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.   Tesla Inc. Price and EPS Surprise      Tesla Inc. Price and EPS Surprise    |      Tesla Inc. Quote    Factors Influencing this Quarter    Tesla has not been able to meet third-quarter 2017 production goals of the new Model 3 sedan. During the quarter, the company delivered only 220 Model 3s and produced 260, which fell short of the production target of 1,500. This indicates that the production has not been as smooth as anticipated.    However, during the quarter ending Sep 30, Tesla delivered 26,150 vehicles, reflecting a rise of 4.5% year over year and 17.7% sequentially.    The rise was due to record deliveries of Model S and Model X during the quarter.    In July 2017, the company started producing Model 3, which comes at half the starting price of Model S. In its second-quarter earnings results Tesla had said that it would aims at achieving a run rate of 5,000 and 10,000 units per week in 2017 and 2018, respectively.    However, as a result of the initial target miss, customers have already started doubting if the company will manage to achieve its target in the future.

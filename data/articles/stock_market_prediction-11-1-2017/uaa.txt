Under Armour Inc (NYSE:UAA) stock was hit hard on Tuesday following a guidance cut in its most recent earnings report. In its earnings report for the third quarter of 2017, Under Armour Inc  cut its outlook for the full year. This includes dropping its earnings per share expectations to between 18 cents and 20 cents. This is far below Wall Street’s earnings per share estimate of 37 cents for the quarter and was a blow to UAA stock. Under Armour Inc also says that it is expecting its revenue for the full year of 2017 to be up in the low single-digit percentage range. The company reported revenue of $4.83 billion in 2016. Analysts are looking for it to report revenue of $5.22 billion for the year, which is an 8% increase from 2016 revenue. The update to Under Armour Inc’s guidance for the year also includes its gross margin dropping 220 basis points when compared to the 46.4% reported in 2016. It is also expecting operating income to range from nothing to $10 million in 2017. Under Armour Inc’s update to its outlook comes alongside one for its current restructuring plan. The company says that it expects to suffer between $140 million to $150 million in pretax charges connected to this effort. The plan was previously only going to include pretax charges ranging from $110 million to $130 million. UA stock also didn’t get any help from its revenue of $1.41 billion for the third quarter of the year. This is down from its revenue of $1.47 billion from the same time last year. It also didn’t meet Wall Street’s revenue estimate of $1.48 billion for the quarter. Under Armour Inc attributes this to weak sales in North America. UAA stock was down 17% as of noon Tuesday and is down 53% year-to-date. As of this writing, William White did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Thearon W. Henderson/Getty    Under Armour's stock is down about 15% after the company posted mixed third-quarter results and lowered its sales and earnings outlook for the rest of the year.  The athletic-apparel company earned an adjusted $0.22 per share as revenue fell 5% to $1.4 billion. Wall Street was looking for $0.19 on revenue of $1.48 billion, according to the Bloomberg consensus. It also announced an $89 million restructuring charge. Under Armour now sees full-year adjusted earnings per share of $0.18 to $0.20, well below its previous forecast of $0.37 to $0.40. It also sees North American revenue up at a low single-digit percentage rate "reflecting lower North American demand and operational challenges due to the implementation of the company's enterprise resource planning system and related service levels," the earnings release said.  "While our international business continues to deliver against our ambition of building a global brand, operational challenges and lower demand in North America resulted in third quarter revenue that was below our expectations," Under Armour Chairman and CEO Kevin Plank said in the earnings release. "Based on these issues in our largest market, we believe it is prudent to reduce our sales and earnings outlook for the remainder of 2017." Before Tuesday's results, shares of Under Armour were down 43.51% this year.  Markets Insider NOW WATCH: The secret to Steve Jobs' and Elon Musk's success, according to a former Apple and Tesla executive See Also: SEE ALSO: Here are 13 ETFs that are crushing it with a more than 60% return in 2017

 Did you hear the great news at UAA?  The University of Alaska Anchorage has just started a new master's degree program in geological sciences. The M.S. degree is the primary working credential for those who find, evaluate and help develop, with rigorous environmental safeguards, Alaska's resources. This is a statement that Alaska is looking over the horizon and is ready to "grow our own" geoscientists with top-level researchers and educators right here in Anchorage. Geologists tend to be an optimistic bunch; there is always another ore deposit or oil field to discover, or geologic hazards to study and mitigate, and the excitement and optimism at UAA about this new advanced-degree program is high.  The University of Alaska is 100 years old this year. This recent action has demonstrated foresight and confidence in the future of Alaska, the university and it mission, and the fact that the university intends to be around for the next hundred years and beyond. Thank you, UAA and UA administration and Board of Regents, for creating this program.  [University of Alaska budget cut by $8 million in budget compromise]  The University of Alaska has strongly supported the growth and development of top-notch, research-grade faculty at UAA who will deliver state-of-the-art geoscience education for decades, through good times and challenging times. There has been no shortage of opportunities for Alaska geologists from Gold Rush days, through the 1964 earthquake, volcanic eruptions (including Katmai/Novarupta in 1912), discovery of the Cook Inlet and North Slope oil fields, glacial flooding, landslides, coastal erosion, groundwater supply, alternative energy, and responsible large-mine development. Most Alaskans know a geoscientist as a neighbor, friend, community volunteer or colleague.  Now, students from Alaska, other states and around the world have the opportunity to join this exciting career field or improve their professional skills. UAA's M.S. program includes both a traditional thesis-track M.S. degree option and a non-thesis M.S. degree. UAA is actively coordinating with the long-established geology and geophysics program at the University of Alaska Fairbanks to broaden opportunities available to students on both campuses. The Geology Department at UAA has received generous industry donations of advanced-technology computer software worth over $100 million along with hardware and datasets to teach students cutting-edge sedimentary basin, energy, and structural geology and geophysics.  Trained geoscientists occupying high-impact jobs are an essential building block of Alaska's continuing economic prosperity and will energize the state's economic engine for decades to come. Master's level geoscience education is critical to:  • Promoting vital long-term resource development in Alaska;  • Addressing critical gaps in U.S. energy and strategic minerals supply;  • Working as resource management and development professionals in Alaska;  • Demonstrating that resource development in Alaska is sustainable and compatible with strong environmental stewardship and social responsibility; and  • Addressing and mitigating geological hazards that may threaten people and infrastructure.  Many firms and agencies want to hire local people who are well-qualified and who understand the unique conditions in Alaska. Keeping these talented people in Alaska is good for our state.  UAA is now accepting applications through Nov. 1 for this program for the first term beginning in January 2018 at the Anchorage campus location. Happy 100th, UA, and rock on, Alaska. The future looks bright!  Stephen Trimble is chair and Jim Munter is vice chair of the Community Advistory Board to UAA's Department of Geological Sciences. The board is made up of professional geoscientists from the oil and gas, environmental consulting, mineral exploration and alternative energy industries, and from Native corporations and government agencies.

http://www.campustimes.org/2017/10/29/womens-basketball-picked-to-win-uaa-title-men-predicted-to-finish-fourth/

As fall sports head into postseason play, UR Men’s and Women’s Basketball are beginning their preseason training, focusing on a conference championship and an NCAA tournament berth. The women were picked to win the University Athletic Association title for this season by the conference’s head coaches, receiving six first-place votes. The men were pegged to finish fourth out of eight teams, despite losing  three stars, Sam Borst-Smith, Mack Montague, and Zach Ayers, to graduation. “We have been having a great preseason so far,” senior forward Tucker Knox said. “All the returners have been playing well together and the freshman are quickly getting up to speed.” Last season, both teams received bids into the NCAA tournament. The men made it all the way into the Elite Eight but lost to Whitman College 91–87 in their final game. The women were defeated by local rival SUNY Geneseo 78–72 in the second round. With an 8–6 record in the UAA, the women finished third in the conference and were 18–9 on the season. The men finished second behind the University of Chicago in the UAA last season with a 10–4 record, and went 24–5 overall. Washington University was picked to win the men’s conference title again this season and received seven first-place votes. Emory University received the other vote for first place and was picked to finish second in the conference. The spot above UR belongs to the University of Chicago, who proved to be tough competition for the Yellowjackets in the two games they played last season. UR defeated the Bears 88–82 in the first game at home and lost 90–87 at their game in Chicago. Behind UR Women’s Basketball, the University of Chicago received two first-place votes and came second in the poll. Washington University, who went 26–3 last season, won the conference last year but were predicted to finish third in 2018.  The return of starters senior post Al Leslie, senior forward and guard Lauren Deming, sophomore guard Lauren Foley, and sophomore point guard Brenna James contributed to receiving votes for winning the UAA title. Leslie had a strong junior year with 21.9 points per game (fourth in UR history), 9.7 rebounds per game, and 44 blocks. Deming followed her with 12.3 points and 7.5 rebounds per game. Last season, Leslie earned three All-America honors and was named East Region Player of the Year by the USBWA and All-Rochester Area Player of the Year. She also set a UR single-season free throw record and holds the second-place spot in school history for single-season points, field goals, and field goal percentage. For the men, junior point guard Jacob Wittig (8.8 ppg, 4.7 apg) and Knox (5.9 ppg, 4.6 rpg) will return to the court as starters. Other key players include junior guard Ryan Clamage, who appeared in all 29 games last season and finished fifth on the team in scoring with 7.5 ppg, and junior guard Michael Mangan who played in 29 games and was ranked 16th in the UAA in steals. Senior guard Kyle Parker, the team’s manager last season, is an addition to the roster this year. He transferred from Grinnell College in the fall of 2016, where he averaged 16 points per game as a junior for the Pioneers. “We have a ton of talent and I think we could surprise people in the UAA,”  Knox said. “We look to build upon the success of last year and be a contender for UAA champions.”   UR Women’s Basketball will play their first game of the season in the Chuck Resler Tournament at the Palestra against Capital University on Nov. 17., with the men playing Bard College on the same day.  

http://www.studlife.com/sports/2017/10/29/cross-country-crowned-uaa-champions-once-again/

The 2017 UAA cross-country championship race was full of new experiences for the Washington University cross-country teams, though with some familiar results. The men’s and women’s cross-country teams competed in Woodland Park, N.J. to defend their UAA crowns Oct. 28. It was their first time ever running at the course and the unique structure presented some adjustments for the team. The women’s cross-country team celebrates its UAA championship win this weekend. In addition to the women’s team’s win, the men’s team also won a UAA title in New Jersey Oct. 28. “[There were] lots of rocks, very little grass and road crossings,” head coach Jeffrey Stiles said. “The footing was questionable in lots of places, arguably dangerous. It was one of those ones where you’re hoping not to come out with any injuries. We had a couple kids who went down on rocks or whatnot, but overall it went very well.” The men’s and women’s teams were not affected much by the troublesome terrain. Both finished first in the race, running away with the championship medals. In the 8-kilometer course, the men (ranked ninth) finished with a score of 40 and a total time of 2:11:24, two minutes and 39 points ahead of the second placed Carnegie Mellon University. The seventh-ranked women scored 37 points in their 6-kilometer race, adding up to a time of 2:00:09, one minute ahead and 37 points below the University of Chicago. Senior David O’Gara led all male runners in the race, finishing with a 25:36.6 time. He became the UAA’s fifth men’s runner to win back-to-back individual championships. The Bears had two other men’s runners in the top-10 as junior Peter Johnsrud came in fourth and senior Kirby Simon came in ninth with times of 26:12.5 and 26:27.1, respectively. Johnsburg, along with O’Gara, earned first team all-UAA honors, while Simon garnered second team honors. Graduate student Ben Rosenkranz joined Simon as a part of the all-UAA second team with an eleventh place, 26:29.1 finish. Junior Chris Blagg and sophomore Marco Quaroni rounded out the men’s top-20 finishers. On the women’s side, it was senior Alison Lindsay leading the way, notching a third place finish with a time of 23:38.0. Following her was sophomore Sophie Watterson, who finished seventh with a time 24:01.6, joining Lindsay for first team All-UAA honors. Saturday’s event was Watterson’s first ever collegiate race. “She’s done some time trials this year and we knew she was ready to run well,” Stiles said of Watterson. “The last race we had to pull the plug because of the heat, so we didn’t run a lot of our kids in the pre-national meet because it was unsafe.” Senior Audrey Western (eighth), junior Lisa Gorham (ninth) and junior Jeri Glicksman (10th) came in consecutive order following Watterson’s seventh place finish. They totaled times of 24:03.9, 24:07.4, and 24:17.7, respectively, each of them earning second team All-UAA honors.   Going forward, the varsity cross-country team will  prepare for their next race at the Midwest Regionals on Nov. 11 in Rock Island, Ill. Stiles said that much of this preparation will include recuperating from a tough weekend on the east coast.  “We’re going to ride the momentum and we’re going to recover,” Stiles said. “The kids are tired and it beat them up for sure. This week will be mostly recovery.”

Under Armour, Inc. (UAA) currently has a Beta value of 0.04. Beta is a measurement of a stock’s price fluctuations, which is often called volatility and is used by investors to gauge how quickly a stock’s price will rise or fall. A stock with a beta of greater than 1.0 is riskier and has greater price fluctuations, while stocks with beta values of less than 1.0 are steadier and generally larger companies. Beta is often measured against the S&P; 500 index. An S&P; 500 stock with a beta of 2.0 produced a 20 percent increase in returns during a period of time when the S&P; 500 Index grew only 10 percent. This same measurement also means the stock would lose 20 percent when the market dropped by only 10 percent. Next, let’s take a look at Under Armour, Inc current P/E ratio. Under Armour, Inc. (UAA) currently has a PE ratio of 25.34. PE ratio is an important parameter to look at when trading a stock mostly because it is easy to calculate. There are a couple of ways to calculate PE ratio either by dividing share price by earnings per share or dividing the market cap by net income. It is important to note that the earnings are usually taken from the trailing twelve months (TTM). Nevertheless, P/E tells us how much an investor is willing to pay for $1 of a company’s earnings. The long-term average P/E is around 15, so on average, investors are willing to pay $15 for every dollar of earnings. Another useful way to look at this: Turn the P/E ratio around to look at the E/P ratio, which when expressed as a percentage gives us the earnings yield. For instance: 1/15 gives us an earnings yield of 6.67%. While we have already looked at Under Armour, Inc beta and P/E ratio, the EPS cannot be ignored. Under Armour, Inc EPS for the trailing twelve months was 0.49. Traders and investors often use earnings per share (TTM) to determine a company’s profitability for the past year. So in essence, EPS is the amount of a company’s net income per share of common stock. Earnings per share equal the company’s net income less any dividends paid on preferred stock divided by the weighted average number of common stock shares outstanding during the year. It would be interesting to see how the earnings fair out considering the recent developments.   Safirstein Metcalf LLP: Under Armour, Inc.

All things considered, it’s pretty safe to say the market was underestimating Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM). Or, perhaps it would be more accurate to say investors overestimated the adverse impact hurricanes Harvey and Irma would have on the company’s operations. XOM stock edged even higher in the wake of Friday morning’s third quarter report, extending a rally that’s been building since early September. Is this the move that will get — and keep — the XOM stock price over the hump? Maybe. In some regards it’s already over the hump, though we’ve seen this before, but to no avail. The good news is that the “what” that will keep Exxon Mobil shares on the bullish side of the fence is on the verge of happening. Last quarter, Exxon Mobil turned $66.2 billion worth of revenue into a per-share profit of 93 cents, easily trouncing the year-ago top line of $56.7 billion and bottom line of 63 cents per share of XOM stock. The pros were only calling for earnings of 86 cents per share on revenue of $63.4 billion. It was a pleasant surprise, to say the least, not just because two major storms — one of which temporarily shuttered Exxon’s Baytown, Texas refinery (the nation’s second-biggest) — didn’t do the fiscal damage analysts expected, but also because the company is expanding margins without any real help from crude oil prices. Crude ended last quarter at $51.56 per barrel up from $48.24 a barrel at the end of Q3 2016. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) also delivered a similar earnings beat, though CVX stock pulled back after falling short of the profit estimate of 98 cents per share, its operating bottom line of 85 cents per share in the third quarter was still better than the year-ago’s 68 cents. Output was up 8%, year-over-year. In short, Exxon Mobil — like Chevron — is getting better at dealing with an environment of low oil prices, keeping a lid on expenses and focusing on expenditures with the best and highest-odds payoffs. As CEO Darren Woods put it, “For the fourth-consecutive quarter, we generated cash flow from operations and asset sales that more than covered our dividends and net investments in the business.” Though it’s always a moving target, the industry’s break-even price for oil has been pared down to around $50 per barrel. Crude prices are hovering just above that mark now. That’s ‘just enough.’ While most of the industry’s players can survive as long as oil prices stay above $50, surviving is hardly thriving. Though Exxon can and will continue to work towards lowering expenses, at this time, most of the potential cost-culling has been done. If XOM and its peers are to grow their bottom lines, it’s primarily going to be driven by rising oil prices.

How an investor views Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stock going forward likely depends on how that same investor sees XOM stock looking backward. The XOM stock price five years ago was $90. As of this writing, it’s $83. Is that good news? In one sense, it is. Oil prices have crashed, and yet including dividends, XOM shareholders have received a modest return over that stretch. Exxon Mobil’s diversification through chemicals and upstream businesses has protected the downside. Even a major driller like Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:APC) is down 28% over that period. Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE:CHK) stock has declined 82%, and many other hot O&G plays from 2012 have gone bankrupt in the interim. The XOM stock price may be down, but it very well could have been worse for investors bullish on oil and gas five years ago. Of course, on the other hand, XOM shareholders have missed out on substantial returns elsewhere. The S&P 500 has risen 82%, not including dividends, over those five years. Exxon’s compounded return even has (slightly) lagged that of U.S. Treasuries in the lowest interest-rate environment in U.S. history. How XOM looks at this point depends in large part on how an investor views the last five years. And it means there’s two very different ways of looking at Exxon Mobil stock. For an income investor, in particular, the past five years might look heartening. Over that five-year period, the price of oil has dropped from the high $80s to the low $50s. Natural gas prices have fallen as well. The past five years might not have been the worst-case scenario in 2012, but they’re not far off either. And yet XOM stock has satisfied two of the most important requirements of income investing, particularly for retired investors. The XOM dividend has provided 3%+ income annually, and after a recent rally investors have kept most of their principal. With the 10-year Treasury yielding just 2.4%, XOM offers more income at the moment. It might not offer the same level of safety – but the past five years show that its diversification does offer substantial protection even in a time of falling energy prices. So the case for XOM stock going forward might actually be helped by history, at least for income investors. XOM stock didn’t break at a time when most smaller energy stocks did. The diversification of retail and chemical operations has kept profits, and the share price, afloat. With the dividend yield at 3.7%, XOM still is going to provide income. And the risk posed by another leg down in energy prices seems manageable, at least if history is any indication.

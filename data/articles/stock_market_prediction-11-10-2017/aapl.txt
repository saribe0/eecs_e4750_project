Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has just enjoyed a 15% increase in anticipation of the iPhone X, its latest release. The question remains: Where does AAPL stock go from here? In the investment world, the expression “buy the rumor, sell the news” is often spoken. In the case of AAPL, investors should probably follow the mantra of buy the anticipation, and now, sell the release. To be sure, Apple remains a phenomenon. Simon Sinek, in his now-famous TEDx Talk, described Apple as a company that understands their “why.” He said Apple describes itself as follows: “Everything we do, we believe in challenging the status quo, we believe in thinking differently. The way we challenge the status quo is by making our products beautifully designed, simple to use, and user-friendly.” Few companies understand their “why” better than Apple. Consequently, people identify with the company and care deeply about its innovations. Six years after the passing of its founder Steve Jobs, Apple maintains its following of fellow believers. As with its previous product releases, people also stood in line for hours for the iPhone X, despite the fact that it will be available a week or so later without having to wait in line. Further, with a market cap approaching $900 billion, AAPL remains one of the largest companies in existence. Despite its size, the company still maintains impressive growth numbers. The iPhone remains Apple’s largest revenue driver. Still, other segments such as the iPad, the Mac and the Apple Watch show sales growth. Overall long-term revenue growth stands at about 8%. Due to a bump caused by a new iPhone release, analysts predict over 20% for the 2018 fiscal year. However, Apple’s inspirational message and continuous growth do not always drive the stock higher. As my colleague, Luke Lango points out, iPhone model releases have often meant a near-term top in AAPL. In 2015, following the release of the iPhone 6s, the stock had lost 25% of its value by the following summer. After the release of the iPhone 5 in 2012, AAPL stock fell by about 40% over the following six months.

Source: Shutterstock Without fail, when someone dares to suggest Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is fallible and that AAPL stock has the potential to lose value, the fanboys come out in spades and “explain” to that person that they simply don’t appreciate the greatness of the company’s products and the profitability of the corporation. This time around isn’t apt to be any different. Nevertheless, simply because small things can end up being big things — and knowing companies are sometimes knocked off pedestals without any warning — a trio of problems with the recently unveiled and hotly touted iPhone X may in some way be a sign that Apple’s passion for perfection is a thing of the past. It’s a reality that should have smart investors at least wondering if AAPL stock has lost the luster it had when Steve Jobs was at the helm. Giving credit where it’s due, Apple’s newest smartphone is an amazing device, functionally and conceptually. The relatively small phone boasts a relatively large screen by using all the “real estate” available to it, the onboard camera is as powerful as any professional-caliber digital camera and the ability to charge the device wirelessly is a big hit. On the flipside, AAPL stock holders have already (or soon will) learn about a few too many flaws with the iPhone that simply wouldn’t have been allowed to exist at a different time for the company. Three of them are conspicuous enough imply Apple is losing its touch when it comes to the quality that its loyal fans fell in love over the course of the past decade. Users of the newest iPhone will likely have noticed the screen is sharper and more vibrant than smartphone screens they’ve seen in the past. There’s a reason. Apple is using an OLED (organic light emitting diodes) screen, which is amazing to be sure, but will eventually result in burn in, or the permanent “ghosting” of a displayed image on the physical screen, even when that image isn’t being displayed on-screen. It’s not Apple’s fault, to be fair. Burn-in is a reality for all OLED screens. But since Apple made a choice to use OLED technology though — and arguably didn’t have to — it’s going to be held accountable by frustrated customers.

 @apollozac After reporting strong earnings and forecasting a record-smashing holiday quarter this week, Apple’s market capitalization has crossed over $900 billion during intraday trading. As MarketWatch notes, this makes Apple the first publicly traded US company to reach this milestone.

Sony A6500 Apple previously broke records last week when it reached $900 billion market capitalization during after-hours trading, but today markets the first time this has happened during intraday trading. Investors are partly jazzed about the strong results Apple reported last Thursday. Apple sold more iPhones than predicted despite the iPhone X not being available in the quarter it just reported. And Apple’s guidance for its holiday quarter is remarkably higher than any previous quarter to date with revenue between $84 billion and $87 billion expected. AAPL is currently trading around $175.60 (with a new intraday high of $175.78). At the current rate, Apple is on its way to becoming the first US publicly traded company to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization; Google (parent company Alphabet) only recently became the second company to cross the $700 billion milestone. Several analysts expect Apple to cross the trillion dollar milestone sooner than later.  Subscribe to 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:  Breaking news from Cupertino.

From the vantage point of investment attractiveness, the stock's current Portfolio Grader score places it 3 among the 37 companies in this industry group, putting it in the top decile; among the sector leaders with a ranking of 24 among the 707 companies in the sector, and number 65 in the nearly 5,000 company Portfolio Grader universe. AAPL has a current recommendation of Strong Buy using the methods for investing of Louis Navellier and his Portfolio Grader stock evaluator.  The current overall Portfolio Grader recommendation on the shares has changed twice in the past month, which represents a greater level of change than is typical. Currently, Portfolio Grader ranks the Information Technology sector number 3 among the 12 sectors in its universe putting it in the top half of all the GICS sectors. The Technology Hardware Storage & Peripherals industry group is ranked 44 among the 69 industry groups within the GICS sectors, placing it below-average in terms of the Navellier scoring system. Within the Portfolio Grader stock ranking system Apple has received above-average scores in 7 of the 8 fundamental areas appraised. AAPL's operational scores are a source of strength with a ranking for sales growth, operating margin and earnings growth that are discernibly above average.  Scores for visibility of earnings are superior with a ranking for earnings revisions, earnings surprises and earnings momentum that are discernibly better than average. AAPL's score for return on equity is strikingly better than its industry group average but its grade for cash flow is below-average.  Apple's fundamental scores give AAPL a place in the top quartile of the industry group.  Portfolio Grader uses the Navellier Proprietary Quantitative Score to view AAPL's shares from the angle of risk/reward. This exclusive scoring system weighs the relative value of the company's shares based on the current price of the shares relative to its peers, the market and risk associated with its industry and sector groups.

Louis Navellier's proprietary Portfolio Grader stock ranking system assesses roughly 5,000 companies every week based on a number of fundamental and quantitative measures. Stocks are given a letter grade based on their results, with A being 'strong buy' and F being 'strong sell'.  Explore the tool here. Commentary provided by UpTick Data Technologies.

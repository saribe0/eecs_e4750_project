https://stocknewsgazette.com/2017/11/09/critical-comparison-allergan-plc-agn-vs-akorn-inc-akrx/

Allergan plc (NYSE:AGN) shares are down more than -16.67% this year and recently increased 1.18% or $2.04 to settle at $175.01. Akorn, Inc. (NASDAQ:AKRX), on the other hand, is up 52.27% year to date as of 11/07/2017. It currently trades at $33.24 and has returned 2.15% during the past week. Allergan plc (NYSE:AGN) and Akorn, Inc. (NASDAQ:AKRX) are the two most active stocks in the Drugs – Generic industry based on today’s trading volumes. Investors are clearly interested in the two names, but is one a better choice than the other? We will compare the two companies across growth, profitability, risk, valuation, and insider trends to answer this question. Growth Companies that can consistently grow earnings at a high compound rate usually have the greatest potential to create value for shareholders in the long-run. Analysts expect AGN to grow earnings at a 9.66% annual rate over the next 5 years. Comparatively, AKRX is expected to grow at a -7.80% annual rate. All else equal, AGN’s higher growth rate would imply a greater potential for capital appreciation. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Profitability and Returns A high growth rate isn’t necessarily valuable to investors. In fact, companies that overinvest in low return projects just to achieve a high growth rate can actually destroy shareholder value. Profitability and returns are a measure of the quality of a company’s business and its growth opportunities. We’ll use EBITDA margin and Return on Investment (ROI) to measure this. EBITDA margin of 22.08% for Akorn, Inc. (AKRX). AGN’s ROI is 0.10% while AKRX has a ROI of 14.80%. The interpretation is that AKRX’s business generates a higher return on investment than AGN’s. Cash Flow  
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 The amount of free cash flow available to investors is ultimately what determines the value of a stock. AGN’s free cash flow (“FCF”) per share for the trailing twelve months was +3.21. Comparatively, AKRX’s free cash flow per share was +0.18. On a percent-of-sales basis, AGN’s free cash flow was 7.33% while AKRX converted 2.02% of its revenues into cash flow. This means that, for a given level of sales, AGN is able to generate more free cash flow for investors. Liquidity and Financial Risk Liquidity and leverage ratios measure a company’s ability to meet short-term obligations and longer-term debts. AGN has a current ratio of 1.20 compared to 4.20 for AKRX. This means that AKRX can more easily cover its most immediate liabilities over the next twelve months. AGN’s debt-to-equity ratio is 0.46 versus a D/E of 0.00 for AKRX. AGN is therefore the more solvent of the two companies, and has lower financial risk. Valuation AGN trades at a forward P/E of 10.86, a P/B of 0.88, and a P/S of 3.79, compared to a forward P/E of 28.66, a P/B of 4.68, and a P/S of 4.44 for AKRX. AGN is the cheaper of the two stocks on an earnings, book value and sales basis. Given that earnings are what matter most to investors, analysts tend to place a greater weight on the P/E. Analyst Price Targets and Opinions Just because a stock is cheaper doesn’t mean there’s more value to be had. In order to assess value we need to compare the current price to where it’s likely to trade in the future. AGN is currently priced at a -27.32% to its one-year price target of 240.78. Comparatively, AKRX is 9.88% relative to its price target of 30.25. This suggests that AGN is the better investment over the next year. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 2.20 for AGN and 3.00 for AKRX, which implies that analysts are more bullish on the outlook for AKRX. Risk and Volatility No discussion on value is complete without taking into account risk. Analysts use a stock’s beta, which measures the volatility of a stock compared to the overall market, to measure systematic risk. A stock with a beta above 1 is more volatile than the market. Conversely, a beta below 1 implies a below average level of risk. AGN has a beta of 1.13 and AKRX’s beta is 1.34. AGN’s shares are therefore the less volatile of the two stocks. Insider Activity and Investor Sentiment Comparing the number of shares sold short to the float is a method analysts often use to get a reading on investor sentiment. AGN has a short ratio of 1.86 compared to a short interest of 8.68 for AKRX. This implies that the market is currently less bearish on the outlook for AGN. Summary Allergan plc (NYSE:AGN) beats Akorn, Inc. (NASDAQ:AKRX) on a total of 10 of the 14 factors compared between the two stocks. AGN is growing fastly, has higher cash flow per share and has a higher cash conversion rate. In terms of valuation, AGN is the cheaper of the two stocks on an earnings, book value and sales basis, AGN is more undervalued relative to its price target. Finally, AGN has better sentiment signals based on short interest.

Fundamentalists and value investors are seeing the low ratio of 3.75 as more positive – demonstrating that the company has a great deal of revenue with a fair price.

Allergan plc’s P/B is valued at 0.87 exhibiting the investor sentiment on the value of the stock to its actual value. A higher P/B ratio of Allergan plc is signposting that the investors have either overvalued it , or that its accountants have undervalued it. The P/B figure is also providing some ideas on whether the shareholders are paying too much for what would be left if the company went bankrupt immediately – but to consider that the company ought to have a lower P/B value. As of now, the increased share price of Allergan plc makes it a lucrative buy for investors.

The company has a current ratio of 1.2 gauging towards its ability in paying short-term and long-term obligations. With the existing current ratio, Allergan plc is more than equipped to confront its liabilities with its assets. Allergan plc has a quick ratio of 1.1 measuring its ability to meet its short term obligations with its most liquid assets. The high quick ratio specifies its better liquidity position on the credit terms the company has negotiated from its suppliers.

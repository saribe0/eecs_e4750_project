Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT) is an interesting player in the Technology space, with a focus on Semiconductor Equipment & Materials. The stock has been active on the tape, currently trading at $56.43, up from yesterday’s close by 0.95%. Given the stock’s recent action, it seemed like a good time to take a closer look at the company’s recent data. Fundamental Analysis No amount of research is complete without a bird’s eye view of the financial data. Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT) currently trades with a market capitalization of $60.44 Billion. That value represents a market adjusting for revenues that have been growing by 32.72 % on a quarterly year/year basis as of the company’s last quarterly report.

 The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For AMAT, the company currently has $5.28 Billion of cash on the books. You can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $3.4 Billion over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to hold steady in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $0.91 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 81.91% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors. Technical Analysis No analysis is ever complete without a thorough survey of a stock’s technical behavior. Looking at the stock’s movement on the chart, Applied Materials, Inc. recorded a 52-week high of $56.82. It is now trading 0.39% off that level. The stock is trading $49.73 its 50-day moving average by -6.7%. The stock carved out a 52-week low down at $28.02. In recent action, Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT) has made a move of +8.85% over the past month, which has come on weak relative transaction volume. Over the trailing year, the stock is underperforming the S&P 500 by 22.64, and it’s gotten there by action that has been more volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. In terms of the mechanics underlying that movement, traders will want to note that the stock is trading on a float of 1.44% with $1.06 Billion sitting short, betting on future declines. That suggests something of the likelihood of a short squeeze in shares of AMAT.

https://stocknews.com/news/amzn-why-amazon-com-inc-amzn-needs-to-have-physical-stores/

AMZN – While shoppers are comfortable buying many items online, Amazon knows some things are best sold in person. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has dominated the e-commerce world for years, and now has its sights set on physical retail as well. It’s perplexing for some investors to understand, since it seems like going backwards. Why, in 2017, is Amazon getting aggressive in the brick-and-mortar world? Well, as CNBC reports, it turns out that consumers still like to buy certain things in physical stores — and probably always will: Financial research firm Gordon Haskett said in a recent survey that aside from music, books, movies and small appliances, consumers showed a preference for in-store purchases. For categories like groceries, household, and health and beauty, buying in a store was more than three times more popular than buying online. “Despite Amazon’s dominance in online traffic, the majority of purchases in several sub-categories still occurs in store,” Gordon Haskett wrote in a note this week. Amazon has responded to consumer demand with a number of moves into physical retail. It bought supermarket chain Whole Foods earlier this year. It also now has 13 brick-and-mortar bookstores in major cities, along with dozens of pop-up stores. Finally, it established a major partnership with Lowe’s to gain a presence in a bunch of their stores. Investors can expect the company’s brick-and-mortar push to intensify in coming years. “You will see more expansion from us,” CFO Brian Olsavsky said in last month’s earnings call. “It’s still early, so those plans will develop over time.” Amazon.com, Inc. shares fell $2.13 (-0.19%) in premarket trading Friday. Year-to-date, AMZN has gained 50.58%, versus a 17.14% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period. AMZN currently has a StockNews.com POWR Rating of C (Neutral), and is ranked #22 of 50 stocks in the Internet category.

Source: Shutterstock A Twitter Inc (NYSE:TWTR) short recently wrote about Twitter co-founder and former CEO Evan Williams selling two million of his directly held shares of TWTR stock. The short’s argument was that Williams wouldn’t be selling almost 50% of his direct ownership position (he also controls millions of shares through a venture capital fund) if the Twitter director didn’t think the sun was setting on the company. In other words, get out while the getting’s good. Why? (and here’s where it gets interesting) Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is taking advertising business from Twitter. THAT made me take a closer look at the subject. Seriously, why invest in TWTR stock when you can get all the good things AMZN has to offer plus a growing ad business, which is not something CEO Jack Dorsey can argue? Although the company doesn’t specifically break out its ad revenues in its quarterly report of net sales by products and services, it does say that its “Other” revenue includes advertising services and the company’s co-branded credit card agreements, so you can get pretty close. In the nine months through Sept. 30, Amazon has $2.9 billion in other revenue, a 55% year-over-year increase. In Q3 2017, other revenue increased by 58%. “Advertising revenue continues to grow very quickly and its year-over-year growth rate is actually faster than the other revenue line item that you see there,” Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky said in the company’s Q3 2017 conference call. “But I would say, generally, we’re very pleased with the advertising business.” No kidding.  Amazon uses the advertising to help its e-commerce customers make better purchasing decisions which leads to the further padding of its lead in online retail while delivering higher margins than it’s used to.  It’s a win-win.   Source: Statista By revenue, it’s still the smallest of Amazon’s businesses, but it’s coming on — other revenue accounted for 2.6% of the company’s $43.7 billion in Q3 2017 revenue — and where it ends up is anyone’s guess. eMarketer suggests Amazon’s digital ad revenues could hit $3.2 billion by 2019, up from $1.7 billion in 2017.

http://www.nasdaq.com/article/amazon-amzn-to-open-fourth-fulfillment-center-in-baltimore-cm875370

 Amazon.com Inc. AMZN plans to expand in Baltimore's Sparrows Point with its fourth Maryland fulfillment center. For the last few years, the company has been spending heavily on its new fulfillment centers. These are important in order to provide the level of service customers have started expecting from Amazon. So far this year, the company has underperformed the industry. Shares of Amazon have gained 50.6% compared with the  industry 's growth of 60.0%.  More About the New Facility The latest fulfillment center, spanning more than 855,000 square feet, will be located at 1700 Sparrows Point Boulevard. The four fulfillment centers in Maryland will together account for a total footprint of 3.3 million square feet. Apart from creating 1,500 new full-time jobs, this new facility will be primarily focusing on the smaller items such as books, electronic devices and children's toys. In fact, Amazon has already installed more than 11,500 solar panels on the Baltimore fulfillment centers' rooftops to focus on the clean energy. These panels generate more than 3.5 MW of combined peak power, thus helping to reduce the amount of electricity drawn from the utility. Consequently, the online retailer has been increasing its investments to build and modernize fulfillment centers primarily to cut shipping costs and speed up delivery. Currently, the company has three fulfillment facilities in Maryland including two in the Baltimore city limits. In 2016, Amazon's capital expenditure increased 51% on a year-over-year basis. A major part of it was utilized in the construction of 26 fulfillment centers and deployment of robotics technology inside them.  Amazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus  Amazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote Bottom Line Fulfillment centers help Amazon in storage and shipping of products, besides handling returns quickly. In fact, these are important in order to cater its customers' needs in a better way. Additionally, small retailers, who are unable to provide relatively cost-efficient shipping, are signing up for Amazon's fulfillment services. Third parties also avail the company's warehouses and shipping services. These, in turn, are expected to help the company boost revenues and drive expansion in the long haul. However, heavy investments in these arrangements (and several other initiatives) are keeping Amazon's margins under pressure, thereby affecting its bottom line. Also, Amazon's retail business is currently facing stiff competition from Alibaba BABA and eBay EBAY , among others. Zacks Rank & Stock to Consider Amazon carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Another better-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is Groupon, Inc. GRPN sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

 Amazon.com Inc. AMZN plans to expand in Baltimore's Sparrows Point with its fourth Maryland fulfillment center. For the last few years, the company has been spending heavily on its new fulfillment centers. These are important in order to provide the level of service customers have started expecting from Amazon. So far this year, the company has underperformed the industry. Shares of Amazon have gained 50.6% compared with the  industry 's growth of 60.0%.  More About the New Facility The latest fulfillment center, spanning more than 855,000 square feet, will be located at 1700 Sparrows Point Boulevard. The four fulfillment centers in Maryland will together account for a total footprint of 3.3 million square feet. Apart from creating 1,500 new full-time jobs, this new facility will be primarily focusing on the smaller items such as books, electronic devices and children's toys. In fact, Amazon has already installed more than 11,500 solar panels on the Baltimore fulfillment centers' rooftops to focus on the clean energy. These panels generate more than 3.5 MW of combined peak power, thus helping to reduce the amount of electricity drawn from the utility. Consequently, the online retailer has been increasing its investments to build and modernize fulfillment centers primarily to cut shipping costs and speed up delivery. Currently, the company has three fulfillment facilities in Maryland including two in the Baltimore city limits. In 2016, Amazon's capital expenditure increased 51% on a year-over-year basis. A major part of it was utilized in the construction of 26 fulfillment centers and deployment of robotics technology inside them.  Amazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus  Amazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote Bottom Line Fulfillment centers help Amazon in storage and shipping of products, besides handling returns quickly. In fact, these are important in order to cater its customers' needs in a better way. Additionally, small retailers, who are unable to provide relatively cost-efficient shipping, are signing up for Amazon's fulfillment services. Third parties also avail the company's warehouses and shipping services. These, in turn, are expected to help the company boost revenues and drive expansion in the long haul. However, heavy investments in these arrangements (and several other initiatives) are keeping Amazon's margins under pressure, thereby affecting its bottom line. Also, Amazon's retail business is currently facing stiff competition from Alibaba BABA and eBay EBAY , among others. Zacks Rank & Stock to Consider Amazon carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Another better-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is Groupon, Inc. GRPN sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

Shares of Jeff Bezos led Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) have lost momentum ahead of its third-quarter earnings which the company is scheduled to report today after the market close. Amazon stock has been almost in a downtrend since the beginning of last week in spite of having many reasons to climb higher. On top of it, AMZN stock is yet to recover from its post-earnings sell-off in July end. Hence, a lot is riding on the Seattle, Washington based company's Q3 earnings to drive the recovery in Amazon stock and for it resume its uptrend. Investor sentiment is little shaky ahead of earnings on account of the big EPS miss in the last quarter earnings. Coming to Street estimates, analysts expect the eCommerce giant to report a top line of $42.14 billion, which would translate into a good 28.8% YoY revenue growth. While the revenue growth has never been a problem for Amazon, it's the EPS which disappointed investors in the second quarter earnings as the company missed the Street estimate by a massive margin. For the latest quarter, the Street's consensus estimate for EPS is a non-GAAP earnings of 3 cents per share, a drastic drop from the year-ago quarter EPS of  52 cents, implying a 94% YoY decline. There's little doubt in concluding that Amazon stock could see another correction if the company misses on the EPS target again. Though the current earnings whisper for Amazon which is a non-GAAP earnings of 8 cents per share does suggest that it could deliver an earnings beat. Apart from all this, the third quarter earnings would have a special focus on the impact of Whole Foods' acquisition on the online retail giant's financials. Further, the operating income and Q4 guidance are other crucial metrics which could have a big impact on AMZN stock's fortunes. For a detailed preview of the AMZN stock's Q3 earnings and more insights about how to play Amazon stock ahead of earnings, please go through our Amazon earnings preview. The so called 'boring' Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock has outperformed the broader markets with year-to-date returns of nearly 27%. Under the leadership of Satya Nadella, Microsoft has charted new all-time highs and is also presently trading near its all-time highs. MSFT stock has seen a steady rally over the last one month going into earnings, gaining more than 7%. Now, the expectations are really high from the Redmond, Washington-based tech company's Q1 earnings, which it is set to report today after the closing bell. In spite of the recent highs, there are expectations from Q1 earnings to propel the Microsoft stock much higher. Moving on to analyst estimates, Wall Street expects the company to report earnings per share of 72 cents on a revenue of $23.56 billion. The analyst estimates translate to a 5.5% YoY growth in revenue whereas earnings see a decline of 4 cents from the year-ago quarter EPS of 76 cents per share. The recent earnings history has been very good and the earnings whisper for MSFT stock of 76 cents also suggests that the company would deliver a beat and match the last year earnings number. Microsoft stock has run up quite a bit ahead of earnings by its own standards. However, that also elevates the risk in the context of today's earnings announcement. Either way, Microsoft's earnings release promises to be an interesting event today. For those interested, here's a detailed look at what to expect from Microsoft earnings today. The third earnings for the day is of Brian Krzanich led Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), also scheduled after the market close. Shares of the Mountain View, California based semiconductor giant have seen a strong bullish rally after the last quarter earnings and Intel stock is up by nearly 18% over the last three months. This has been very unlike INTC stock from the first half of 2017 when it was largely subdued. The question now is, whether the latest Q3 earnings will set the Intel stock on a new rally or not? First, we shall have a look at the Street estimates. The average analyst EPS estimate for the Chipzilla in Q3 is 80 cents per share same as the last year same quarter EPS number. The chipmaker is expected to deliver a revenue of $15.73 billion which translates to a marginal YoY decline of 0.3%. One of the archrivals of the semiconductor giant, AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) the other day posted strong top line and bottom line numbers. It's been widely discussed AMD is closing down on Intel in the CPU market and mounting a stiff challenge in its near monopoly server market. Now, the onus is on the Chipzilla, to prove that it can fend off the challenge from its much smaller rivals Dr. Lisa Su led AMD. The performance of the CPU and server segment will be closely watched as those are the segments where AMD seems to be gaining traction at the cost of Intel. As we had noted in our recent detailed Intel Q3 earnings preview, while one can expect Intel to deliver another earnings beat, but the chances of any steep gains in Intel stock immediately following the earnings look grim. The earnings whisper number, which is believed to be Street's unofficial view, suggests an EPS of 82 cents, implying a 2 cents earnings beat. Looking for fundamentally strong tech stocks like Apple?

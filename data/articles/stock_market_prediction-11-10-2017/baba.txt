Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA) smashed second quarter revenue and earnings estimates last week, but BABA stock didn’t do all that much. It rose briefly to a high of $190 shortly after the open, but, by the end of the day, BABA stock had given up all those gains, and then some.  Some said that was the sign of the end for BABA stock. It had doubled already this year. The run was over. The China retail boom was winding down. But those people clearly didn’t take a look at BABA’s numbers. Across all important metrics, BABA reported accelerated growth in the second quarter. Core commerce revenue growth ticked up. Cloud computing revenue growth ticked up. Annual active consumer growth hit double-digits for the first time in four quarters. Clearly, the China retail boom isn’t winding down at all. In fact, it’s accelerating. Consequently, the run in BABA stock isn’t over, either. BABA stock has bounced back and is now trading right around all-time highs. I see another 25% upside. Here’s why. At its heart, the Alibaba growth narrative is all about the China urbanization boom. China’s middle-class is starting to urbanize at an unprecedented rate. Because China’s working class is significantly larger than America’s working class, there is tremendous growth potential, as Chinese consumers to start to act and spend like American consumers. Alibaba is at the forefront of this trend. That’s the good news. The better news is that this trend isn’t slowing down. It’s actually still gaining momentum. Alibaba’s core commerce revenues rose 45% last year. That accelerated to 58% growth in the first quarter of 2018, and then 63% in the second quarter of 2018. Most businesses that show such dramatic revenue increases experience a slow-down. Not Alibaba. It experiences a 40% tick-up in growth. That unusual strength underscores just how big the China urbanization boom is — and how long Alibaba’s growth runway is. The accelerating commerce revenue growth is being driven by more consumers interacting on Alibaba’s retail marketplaces than ever before. Alibaba now has 488 million annual active consumers. Moreover, despite its massive size, Alibaba is actually seeing its net active consumer adds each quarter go up. Alibaba added 11 million active consumers three quarters ago, 12 million two quarters ago, and 22 million last quarter. Again, this unusual growth acceleration underscores just how big Alibaba’s growth opportunity is. And that is just the commerce side of things. Alibaba is also the leading cloud player in China. That growth narrative is also accelerating. Cloud computing revenues rose 96% in the first quarter of 2018. They rose 99% in the second quarter. In fact, Alibaba Cloud is the fastest-growing major cloud platform in the world. With only 2.6% market share, Alibaba Cloud has a long runway for growth ahead of it. With Alibaba, then, what you have is a company with accelerating growth in two rapidly growing markets. That is an excellent combination which should lead to BABA stock heading higher.

Recent insider trends for Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) have caught the attention of investors. Analysts study insider data to get a sense of sense of what key shareholders think about the outlook for a particular stock. In the case of BABA, the data has some interesting implications for where the stock might be headed. Institutions own 36.29% of Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA)’s shares. The total value of these holdings, in millions, is $175,195. Among active positions in the latest quarter, 590 holders increased their positions by a total of 99.87 million shares, 360 holders decreased the positions by a total of 100.65 million shares, and 132 holders held their positions. This works out to a net decrease in ownership of 776799 shares, and suggests that institutions are feeling bearish about the stock. Among new and sold out positions, 170 holders initiated new positions by a total of 23.35 million shares and 56 holders exited their positions by a total of 37.66 million shares. This nets out to a decrease of 14.31 million shares and is another bearish sign for BABA.

The data from the past twelve months tells a similar story:  ownership increased by a net of 0 shares.

 Analysts often look at short interest, or the number of shares currently being shorted by investors, to aid in their outlook for a particular stock. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)’s short interest is 133.94 million shares, or % of the float. This represents a decrease of -0% in the number of shares being shorted compared to the previous reading, and implies that investors felt less pessimistic about the stock during the past two weeks. In light of the insider ownership and trading data it makes sense to consider technicals to see if they come to a similar conclusion about the outlook for BABA. A composite of 13 technical indicators that includes measures such as moving averages and momentum oscillators suggests that BABA is a Strong buy, which implies that BABA is expected to outperform the market based on prior trading patterns. Conclusion

Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) reported pretty strong quarterly results in October. Despite a slowdown in investment banking, BofA still beat earnings expectations. It didn’t do much for BAC stock though. The company missed on revenues, and when you look further at the situation, you see more and more weaknesses in BAC’s story. Management has done a great job reviving the company. But when BAC stock is up 60% over the past year, you need more than that. I fear this is as good as it gets, and BAC stock will sell off soon. BAC stock has come a long way since early 2016. In less than two years, BAC stock has rallied from a low of $12 to $27. That’s a 125% gain. Over the same stretch, its major rivals all rallied, but to a significantly lesser degree. Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS) is up 54%, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) rose 70%, Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C) rallied 81%, Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE:WFC) is up just 14%. The sector ETF, Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLF) gained 26%. This reflects investor sentiment more than anything. If you look at the gains, the banks previously viewed as safest, such as Wells Fargo, massively underperformed. Meanwhile, the banks that fared the worst during the financial crisis, such as Citigroup and Bank of America flew up the fastest. This came not from superior operating performance, but instead from investors finally abandoning the financial crisis mentality and looking at former dogs like BAC and Citigroup with a fresh set of eyes. In November 2017, however, there is no stigma left on former worst of breed banks like BofA. Of its immediate peer group, BofA (15.8x) actually has the highest PE ratio at the moment. Goldman Sachs, a clearly superior bank, is at just 12x earnings, and well-managed JP Morgan is at 14x. It’s hard to justify this on operating performance either. On key metrics such as Return on Equity “ROE” and profit margin, BAC tends to rank in the middle of the pack or lower. One point in Bank of America’s favor, their price/book ratio is still lower than their peers. But bears would argue that is justified given that there is little evidence that BofA has better assets than its peers. To justify a higher PE ratio than its peers, Bank of America would need something that makes it stand out. However, it’s unclear what BofA’s distinctive edge is. Are they the country’s leading investment bank? No, that’s Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan. BofA is a strong third, but third doesn’t merit first-place valuation. Are they the largest bank overall in the U.S. by total assets? No, Bank of America is number two there, again trailing JP Morgan. Wells Fargo still dominates U.S. mortgages. Again, Bank of America has a strong position, but not the leading one. Bank of America’s post-financial crisis strategy has been to focus on higher-quality customers. Their average FICO scores on new loans are substantially above the median. Unfortunately, that appears to be the new norm for most of the large U.S. banks. Non-traditional lenders are picking up more of the slack with lower credit score borrowers as the huge national banks all try to avoid repeating the errors of 2008. Other BofA bulls point to restructuring, digital efforts, and so on, but then again, what large U.S. banks aren’t making these moves too?

That value represents a market adjusting for revenues that have been growing by 12.50 % on a quarterly year/year basis as of the company’s last quarterly report. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For BAC, you can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $12.14 Billion over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to fall in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $0.48 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 69.27% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors. Technical Analysis No analysis is ever complete without a thorough survey of a stock’s technical behavior. Looking at the stock’s movement on the chart, Bank of America Corporation recorded a 52-week high of $27.98. It is now trading 0.23% off that level.

In terms of the mechanics underlying that movement, traders will want to note that the stock is trading on a float of 1.10% with $10.42 Billion sitting short, betting on future declines. That suggests something of the likelihood of a short squeeze in shares of BAC.

Recent price movements in the stock of Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) have caught the attention of the investment community. It is widely believed that a stock’s future performance can best be predicted by analyzing prior trends and patterns in price. In the case of BAC, the chart has some interesting things to say about where the stock might be headed in the future. How has the stock performed recently? Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) in the last month has increased +6.14%. Shares are now up over the past year, outperforming the broad market by -100% and outperformed a peer group of similar companies by 121%.

Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) has been trading in a bullish manner, based on the relative positions of the stock’s 20 and 200 day moving averages. Momentum indicators 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that BAC may be headed in the future. To forecast a stock’s future performance, analysts use momentum indicators, which take into account the size and speed of these price movements. As momentum begins to slow, it may be a sign that a recent trend is about to reverse. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for BAC is 69.00%, which suggests that the stock is not particularly expensive or cheap, and not predisposed to a reactive price movement based on this measure. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 91.61%, tells a different story, and suggests that BAC currently trades in overbought territory. What do the trading volumes reveal? Price isn’t the only tool analysts use to forecast future performance. Volume patterns can also reveal some important insights. If, for instance, a stock’s volumes suddenly increase by a significant amount, it’s usually a sign that the level of conviction behind the trade is high. Investors may feel very strongly about the future direction of the stock in question. Bank of America Corporation (BAC) average trading volume of 62,215,156 during the past month is 21.05% below its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been less active than usual in the stock in recent times. What do the analysts think? BAC is currently undervalued by -1.07% relative to the average 1-year price target of $28.12 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts.

Few under the age of 30 might remember, but General Electric Co. was once a model of corporate greatness. Back in 1999, when Steve Jobs was still fiddling with iMacs, Fortune magazine proclaimed Jack Welch, then GE’s chief executive officer, the best manager of the 20th Century. Jack Welch Few people -- of whatever age -- would lavish such praise on the manufacturer these days. GE, that paragon of modern management, has fallen so far that it’s scarcely recognizable. The old GE is dead, undone by an unfortunate mix of missteps and bad luck. The new one now confronts some of the most daunting challenges in the company’s 125-year history. The numbers tell the story: This year alone, roughly $100 billion has been wiped off GE’s stock market value. With mounting cash-flow problems at the once-mighty company, even the dividend is at risk of being cut. The last time GE chopped the payout was in the Great Recession -- and before that, the Great Depression. And yet the hit to the collective psyche of generations of investors and managers is incalculable. For decades, GE-think infiltrated boardrooms around the world. Six Sigma quality control, strict performance metrics, management boot camps -- all that and more informed the MBAs of the 1970s, ’80s, ’90s and into this century. GE, in turn, seeded corporate America with its executives. Now, John Flannery, GE’s new CEO, is struggling to win back the trust of anxious investors. He’s set to detail his turnaround plans on Monday -- and has said he’ll consider every option. “There’s nothing less than the fate of a once great, great company on the line,” said Thomas O’Boyle, the author of “At Any Cost: Jack Welch, General Electric, and the Pursuit of Profit.” “Some of the fundamental notions about its status as a conglomerate and whether it can succeed in a world of increasing complexity are really being challenged right now.” In hindsight, the seeds of this struggle were planted decades ago. Welch expanded and reshaped GE with hundreds of acquisitions and demanded every GE unit be No. 1 or No. 2 in its industry. He also culled low-performers ruthlessly, earning the nickname Neutron Jack. By the time he retired, in 2001, GE’s market value had soared from less than $20 billion to almost $400 billion. But all that maneuvering, plus GE’s increasingly complex financial operations, obscured the underlying performance and put the company in peril during the 2008 financial crisis. Welch’s successor, Jeffrey Immelt, soon embarked on a plan to undo much of the House that Jack Built. He would sell NBC and most of the finance operations -- two of the businesses that defined Welch’s tenure -- along with units such as plastics and home-appliances. The moves narrowed GE’s focus, yet it remains a collection of somewhat disparate manufacturing businesses, ranging from jet engines to oilfield equipment. Unfortunately for GE, that industrial conglomerate model has fallen sharply out of favor on Wall Street. And the rise of activist investors like Nelson Peltz has encouraged companies to try to boost their stock prices however they can, rather than focus on the long term. GE recently welcomed one of Peltz’s partners at Trian Fund Management to the board. “The reckoning had to come,” said Jack De Gan, chief investment officer of Harbor Advisory, which has been a GE shareholder for more than 20 years before selling most of the shares in the past few weeks. GE’s leaders have long defended the multi-business strategy by pointing to the benefits of sharing technology across product lines -- jet engines, for instance, have a lot in common with gas turbines. In an interview with Bloomberg in June, Flannery dismissed concerns about conglomerates, saying investors care more about outcomes. “They want growth, they want visibility, they want predictability, they want margin rate,” Flannery said. “And there are a multitude of models to produce that.” The new CEO has already said he’ll divest at least $20 billion of assets. He’s coming under pressure to do even more. “Anything less than a sweeping plan to ‘de-conglomerate’ the portfolio would be viewed as disappointing,” Deane Dray, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, said this week in a note to clients. The potential moves include unloading its transportation, oil, health-care and lighting operations. Read more: Bloomberg Gadfly on a GE Breakup To be sure, GE’s issues run deeper than the composition of the company. One of its biggest divisions, power-generation, is in the early stages of a deep market slump -- just two years after bulking up with the $10 billion acquisition of Alstom SA’s energy business. GE’s cash flow is light, potentially putting the dividend in jeopardy and driving investors away from the stock. Flannery has spoken of the need to change GE’s culture and instill a sense of accountability. He’s reined in excessive spending -- on corporate cars and planes, on the new Boston headquarters -- and replaced top executives. But the sudden changes, combined with Flannery’s relative lack of public reassurances, have spooked investors. In the days after Flannery’s first quarterly earnings as CEO, when he called GE’s performance “completely unacceptable,” the stock fell and fell. And fell some more, closing at the lowest level in five years on Nov. 2. The shares slid less than 1 percent to $19.99 on Thursday, bringing the 2017 loss to 37 percent. “You think about a company like Kodak. Will GE become that?” said Vijay Govindarajan, a professor at Dartmouth University’s Tuck School of Business who served as GE’s professor-in-residence in 2008 and 2009. Some investors may be throwing in the towel, but Govindarajan isn’t giving up. “I will put my bet that GE will weather this and come back,” he said.

General Electric is planning layoffs even as it goes ahead with construction of its new Boston headquarters, and the money-hemorrhaging company readies for a reckoning with investors Monday — but Mayor Martin J. Walsh said he hasn’t been informed of the job cuts. GE officials confirmed to the Herald that the planned Boston headquarters — originally slated for 800 jobs — would see layoffs, but they would not give out figures, saying the effect would be limited.
  

    if (typeof googletag != 'undefined') {
      googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('mobile_box1'); });
    }
    

 “As we have said, all aspects of the company are being evaluated for cost efficiencies, and that includes job reductions,” GE spokesman Jeff Caywood told the Herald. “We are committed to Boston and look forward to moving to Innovation Point in the first half of 2019. Renovation and rehabilitation of the two brick buildings are underway.” As part of GE’s agreement to move to Boston from Fairfield, Conn., the company is supposed to get $25 million in tax breaks that are tied to how many employees it hires. Walsh praised GE for promising more property tax revenue and new jobs as it constructs its new global headquarters in Fort Point, and said he was unaware that the company now plans to cut back here. “I continue to look forward to their headquarters playing a positive role in our community,” Walsh said in a statement. “While I know the company at large is evaluating cost efficiencies across the country, I have not been made aware by General Electric of any planned job layoffs here in Boston.” New GE CEO John Flannery has called for cuts to the struggling company, saying it is slashing $1 billion in costs this year, with $2 billion more in cuts planned for next year. He told investors last month that “everything is on the table” as the company looks to reduce costs. GE’s third-quarter earnings report last month was “completely unacceptable,” Flannery said, as profit fell to 29 cents a share — nearly half the 49 cents a share predicted by most analysts — and cash flow over the year declined to $1.74 billion from $2.9 billion. Flannery said he will give a more complete picture of the company’s cuts and plans, including potentially reducing its dividend, at its investors’ meeting Monday. After seeing GE’s quarterly earning reports last month, Walsh said he wasn’t worried about the company’s financial woes. “I’m not concerned here in Boston,” Walsh said. “I think this is the first time out of many that we’re going to be living the ups and downs of a company, but just because their corporate headquarters is here doesn’t automatically mean cuts or other various happenings within the company will affect Boston specifically.”

Source: Shutterstock It’s a terrible feeling to pile on the back of General Electric Company (NYSE:GE). GE stock was one of the first stocks I ever purchased and it did very well for me. It also tripled off the low of the mortgage crisis. Alas, GE stock has been flailing for some time. I think it is going to get worse, and it all pretty much can be laid at the feet of Jeffrey Immelt. I know some investors want to bottom fish. Some investors think that GE stock is bargain and it can’t go much lower. And some investors think a dividend cut is unthinkable. To this, all I can offer is a quote from Battlestar Galactica: “All of this has happened before, and it will happen again.” GE stock DID cut its dividend after the mortgage crisis, from $0.31 to $0.10. General Electric will do everything it can to avoid cutting the dividend because if that happens, selling will certainly accelerate. Many retired investors believe in GE because they’ve probably held GE stock a very long time. There’s a problem for GE. The company divested its entire financial business, appliances and water systems. That means less revenue, and struggles in the other divisions have resulted in less cash flow. GE has been free-cash-flow negative for several quarters. In the last four alone, FCF was negative to the tune of $576 million, $185 million, $1.16 billion and $460 million.  Yet GE still paid out a total of $8.6 billion. That means the total cash drain on GE was almost $11 billion. Now, GE does have $78 billion of cash on hand, so there is that backstop. The problem is GE needs a lot of cash to get its business running again. So paying the dividend from cash is fine … for now. Otherwise, though, the dividend has to be cut, or cash flow must increase, or funds have to be raised via debt or equity. That would be awful. Borrowing money or diluting shareholders to maintain a dividend? However, if you think the situation with GE stock price is as bad as it can get, I give you Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (NYSE:TEVA). Every time I thought TEVA had hit bottom, I was proven wrong. There was just more and more bad news. Yet it was bad news that was ultimately always there if one cared to see it. I see GE in the same way. Next Page Article printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2017/11/no-one-is-coming-to-save-general-electric/. ©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC

Source: Shutterstock It’s a terrible feeling to pile on the back of General Electric Company (NYSE:GE). GE stock was one of the first stocks I ever purchased and it did very well for me. It also tripled off the low of the mortgage crisis. Alas, GE stock has been flailing for some time. I think it is going to get worse, and it all pretty much can be laid at the feet of Jeffrey Immelt. I know some investors want to bottom fish. Some investors think that GE stock is bargain and it can’t go much lower. And some investors think a dividend cut is unthinkable. To this, all I can offer is a quote from Battlestar Galactica: “All of this has happened before, and it will happen again.” GE stock DID cut its dividend after the mortgage crisis, from $0.31 to $0.10. General Electric will do everything it can to avoid cutting the dividend because if that happens, selling will certainly accelerate. Many retired investors believe in GE because they’ve probably held GE stock a very long time. There’s a problem for GE. The company divested its entire financial business, appliances and water systems. That means less revenue, and struggles in the other divisions have resulted in less cash flow. GE has been free-cash-flow negative for several quarters. In the last four alone, FCF was negative to the tune of $576 million, $185 million, $1.16 billion and $460 million.  Yet GE still paid out a total of $8.6 billion. That means the total cash drain on GE was almost $11 billion. Now, GE does have $78 billion of cash on hand, so there is that backstop. The problem is GE needs a lot of cash to get its business running again. So paying the dividend from cash is fine … for now. Otherwise, though, the dividend has to be cut, or cash flow must increase, or funds have to be raised via debt or equity. That would be awful. Borrowing money or diluting shareholders to maintain a dividend? However, if you think the situation with GE stock price is as bad as it can get, I give you Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (NYSE:TEVA). Every time I thought TEVA had hit bottom, I was proven wrong. There was just more and more bad news. Yet it was bad news that was ultimately always there if one cared to see it. I see GE in the same way. Next Page Article printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2017/11/no-one-is-coming-to-save-general-electric/. ©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC

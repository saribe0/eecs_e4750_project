Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) got another boost for its cloud computing unit and it has rival Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) to thank. With all sorts of retailers balking at housing their data with Amazon’s Web Services (AWS) due to competitive concerns, Kroger Co. (KR), the Cincinnati-based supermarket operator, has joined the growing list. In an interview with CNBC, Chris Hjelm, chief information officer at Kroger, said the company is housing its data at cloud offerings by Microsoft and Alphabet Inc.'s Google (GOOG). (See also: Microsoft to Triple Cloud Capacity in China.) "For obvious reasons competitively, it doesn't make sense for us to do a ton to help grow that business for them," Hjelm said during the interview. Ever since Amazon’s multi-billion-dollar purchase of Whole Foods this summer, Kroger has become a direct competitor to the e-commerce giant. As result, Kroger doesn’t want a rival in charge of its data. It doesn’t help that the Seattle-based online retailer is also eyeing the pharmaceutical market, which would be another competitive threat to Kroger.   According to CNBC, the supermarket company gets around 9% of its revenue from the pharmacies it operates. The executive told CNBC the company started moving to Microsoft's Azure cloud and Google Cloud in late 2016. He did note there is still some business with Amazon Web Services, but that it's through companies it has acquired. As for new projects, Hjelm said the investments won’t be going to AWS, noting that it doesn’t feel like it's losing a competitive advantage by tapping Microsoft and Google for its cloud needs. (See also: Amazon Cloud Business May Be Slowing: Keybanc.) While AWS is still the dominant cloud computing company in the U.S., lodging revenue growth of 42% to $4.58 billion in the third quarter ended in September, it is feeling pressure from the likes of Microsoft and Google. For its fiscal first quarter, Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft said it surpassed its goal of $20 billion in annualized revenue run rate for its cloud business, which includes its Azure cloud offering. Azure revenue jumped 90% compared to a year ago while Office 365 subscriptions increased 42% from last year’s fiscal first quarter. “This quarter we exceeded $20 billion in commercial cloud ARR​, outpacing the goal we set just over two years ago,” said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella in prepared remarks when reporting quarterly results. “Our results reflect accelerating innovation and increased usage and engagement across our businesses as customers continue to choose Microsoft to help them transform.” Analysts had expected Microsoft to hit that self-imposed cloud target next year. Microsoft’s fortunes in the cloud market have a lot to do with the diversity of its client base and the expansion of rival AWS’s parent into all sorts of markets. With companies balking at giving Amazon more business, even in the cloud, it’s been a boon for Microsoft and Google.

Sign up for our daily recaps of the ever-changing search marketing landscape. Google parent Alphabet announced third-quarter results. Both revenues and earnings per share beat Wall Street estimates. The company reported roughly $27.8 billion in total revenues (up 24 percent), with Google contributing all but $302 million of that amount. Earnings per share were $9.57, which was about $1.24 higher than expected. Advertising generated just over $24 billion in quarterly revenue. Operating income was about $7.8 billion. However, traffic acquisition costs (TAC) rose to $3.1 billion (vs. $2.6 billion a year ago). There are sure to be analyst questions about that item. The revenue breakdown by segment: Paid clicks on Google properties were up 6 percent year over year and aggregate cost per click (CPC) was up 1 percent. Here’s more detail: Paid click growth was significant. However, CPCs were down (18 percent) from a year ago but up slightly (1 percent) from last quarter. Alphabet (GOOG) shares are up in after-hours trading. The company says it now has more than 78,000 employees, compared with just under 70,000 a year ago. The earnings call webcast is happening now.

Time is a flat circle. Alphabet announced its third-quarter earnings today (Oct. 26), and yet again, it brought in a ton of cash, almost entirely from Google’s advertising business. The company generated $27.8 billion in revenue, up 24% from the same quarter last year, making this Alphabet’s highest-revenue quarter ever. (The previous record was $26.06 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016.) Roughly $24.1 billion of that revenue, or about 87%, came from Google’s ad sales. Alphabet reported $7.8 billion in profit for the quarter, up about 35% from the same period a year earlier. Most of the remainder of Alphabet’s revenue, about $3.4 billion, came from other revenue streams at Google, including hardware sales, cloud services, and sales of subscription services like YouTube TV and Google Play music, chief financial officer Ruth Porat said on the company’s earnings call. Just $302 million (around 1% of Alphabet’s revenue) came from sales from every other Alphabet company, lumped into the “Other Bets” bucket of its earnings. Analysts surveyed ahead of earnings had expected Alphabet to only bring in around $22 billion in revenue. The large beat saw the company’s Class A shares rising over $40 (about 4%) in after-hours trading. It remains to be seen whether investors will tire of Alphabet relying on the same old revenue sources. The company has been massively successful selling ads against search results on its own sites and apps, and selling ads on other companies’ websites. While those businesses show no signs of slowing, Alphabet has also invested billions into researching and developing a series of ambitious “moonshot” projects. It’s unclear whether those so-called Other Bets will ever be as important to Alphabet’s bottom line as its search engine has been. Those moonshots include self-driving cars at Waymo, internet-beaming balloons and delivery drones in the X research lab, defeating death at Calico, and myriad other companies. They have largely been money pits for Alphabet since the company spun them out from its core Google business in 2015. The only real revenue that’s come out of Other Bets to date has been hardware sales from Nest, Alphabet’s internet-of-things device company, and Fiber, its fiber-optic internet service.

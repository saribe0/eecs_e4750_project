Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) said earlier today that it was awarded a contract by the Air Force Research Laboratory to develop and produce high-energy fiber laser weapons for tactical fighter aircraft. The contact is valued at $26.2M, but analysts say the potential market opportunity for such airborne weapon systems in the future could become much more significant once technology challenges are overcome. "You get a low cost per shot - much cheaper than a missile in almost every case," says Daniel Goure, a defense analyst and senior VP of the Lexington Institute, in explaining the potential advantages of laser weapons. "One of the things we find in a lot of our systems - land, sea and air - is that we run out of shots particularly on the defense. You just run  out of bullets or missiles. If you have laser, it avoids having to reload." The contract is part of the AFRL's Self-protect High Energy Laser Demonstrator program, which is designed to combine small, high-power laser systems on tactical  aircraft for self-defense capabilities, including to defend against  missiles.

Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) stock took a hit today with the release of its earnings report for the third quarter of 2017. Source: Praveer Sharma via Flickr Lockheed Martin Corporation’s earnings report for the third quarter of year started off bad with earnings per share of $3.24. This is down from its earnings per share of $7.93 from the same time last year. It also wasn’t able to reach Wall Street’s earnings per share estimate of $3.26, which isn’t good news for LMT stock. Revenue of $12.17 billion for the third quarter of 2017 also didn’t do LMT stock any favors. Analysts were looking for Lockheed Martin Corporation to report revenue of $12.81 billion during the quarter. Still, it was an increase over its revenue of $11.55 billion from the third quarter of 2016. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Lockheed Martin Corporation reported net earnings of $939 million in the third quarter of 2017. This is a large drop from its net earnings of $2.40 billion reported in the same period of the year prior. While the current earnings report hasn’t been the best for LMT stock, it may still have hope for 2017. Lockheed Martin Corporation has increased its outlook for the full year to include earnings per share ranging from $12.85 to $13.15. It was previously expecting earnings per share to come between $12.30 and $12.60. Wall Street is looking for 2017 earnings per share of $12.64. Lockheed Martin Corporation’s guidance increase also extends to its revenue for 2017. The security and aerospace company is expecting revenue to range from $50.00 billion to $51.20 billion. It’s previous guidance had revenue coming between $49.80 billion and $50.00 billion. Analysts are estimating revenue of $50.59 billion for the year.

https://investorplace.com/2017/10/3-big-stock-charts-for-tuesday-biogen-inc-biib-lockheed-martin-corporation-lmt-and-mcdonalds-corporation-mcd/

The earnings cycle is sending some mixed signals for the first time this quarter as three more widely watched stocks provided just “OK” earnings results for the quarter. With the major indices trading at their all-time highs, “OK” results are usually likely to cause traders to start hitting the “sell” button, as we’re seeing on a few stocks today. Today’s three big stock charts analyze the price patterns of Biogen Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) and McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) as two out of three of these companies are trading lower in the wake of their earnings results creating potential buying opportunities.  Biogen shares traded strongly right into their earnings report, suggesting that the company needed to nail their earnings report to avoid a “sell the news” situation that would take BIIB stock back into its trading range. The report didn’t blow investor’s hair back, so let’s see what the chart says now:  Defense stocks have been among the groups of stocks posting strong, low volatility rallies, you know, the kind everyone likes. The problem happens when a company like that misses earnings, the way that Lockheed Martin did. This quarter’s results missed expectations, although management did guide forward earnings higher, which is the saving grace right now. So, is LMT stock a buy on this dip?

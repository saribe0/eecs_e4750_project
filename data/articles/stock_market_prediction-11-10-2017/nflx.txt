It’s safe to say that FANG killed it this quarter. All four of the tech giants reported blowout earnings. Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) breezed by expectations thanks to robust ad growth. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) also crushed expectations. Same with Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX). Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL) posted perhaps its best quarter of the year. And NFLX stock only has room to grow. Clearly, the trend of the technology space consolidating around 4 major players remains in tact. Facebook owns social media. Amazon owns ecommerce (and cloud). Netflix owns streaming video on demand. Alphabet owns search. But NFLX stock actually slipped from $200-plus all-time highs to just over $190 in the week following its blowout earnings report. I said buy the dip. The sell-off was just a breather in a very strong secular growth narrative. Now, NFLX stock trades back around $200-plus all-time highs. NFLX stock should continue to trend higher, pushed by a huge near-term catalyst which strengthens the long-term growth narrative. Consequently, I think now is a really good time to own NFLX stock. When it comes to NFLX stock, follow the content. Hugely successful original content launches lead to better-than-expected sub growth. Better-than-expected sub growth leads to a higher NFLX stock price. From this standpoint, right now is the perfect time to buy NFLX stock. Why? Stranger Things. Stranger Things is perhaps the best thing that has ever happened to Netflix. NFLX stock wasn’t the superstar it is today back in early 2016. The company was having a difficult time proving its original content growth strategy as sub growth kept coming in below expectations. NFLX stock traded as low as $85 in 2016 versus a high of $130 near the end of 2015. But that all changed in the summer of 2016 when Stranger Things launched. It was a huge hit. Everyone and their best friend watched the sci-fi series. Investors finally bought into the original content growth strategy as Stranger Things powered far better-than-expected sub growth in the Oct. 2016 earnings report. NFLX stock hasn’t looked back since then. Naturally, then, Stranger Things 2 is a big thing for NFLX shareholders to pay attention to. Right now, the read is exceptionally bullish.

FANG killed it this quarter. Social media leader Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) smashed analyst estimates thanks to FB stock’s robust ad revenue growth on top of healthy margin expansion. Retail leader Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) also smashed expectations due to continued strength in the e-commerce business as well as continued dominance in the cloud space. Meanwhile, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) reported really strong subscriber growth numbers which easily breezed past analyst expectations. Alphabet Inc (NADSAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL) bounced back from a European Commission fine-plagued second quarter to report perhaps its best earnings of the year. But not all stocks are treated equally. AMZN stock and GOOG stock rallied big after their reports, while FB stock and NFLX stock dropped. The NFLX drop makes sense. NFLX stock had rallied big into the report. It became a classic “sell the news” event. NFLX stock was depressed for a few days, but then it bounced back. The FB stock price drop makes less sense. FB stock had not rallied big into the report. It wasn’t a classic “sell the news” event. Instead, investors got jittery about increased security spend adversely affecting profitability in the future. Those jitters are overdone, and the selloff is unnecessarily short-sighted. And the FB stock price is headed for $200 soon. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg emphasized safety and security over profitability on the company’s most recent earnings call. With his company finding itself on Capitol Hill and on the wrong side of headlines regarding fake news, this emphasis was a smart move. But Zuckerberg and fellow senior management at Facebook went further than just emphasizing safety and security. They actually said expenses would rise a lot more next year than initially anticipated due to increased investment in safety and security. That was a brilliant move. Investors didn’t appreciate it (FB stock sold off because it implies a less rosy margin growth outlook going forward), but the move sets a gold standard for transparency in the digital advertising world, evades a government crackdown (and potentially billion-dollar fines), and will inevitably attract more advertisers to the platform.

With the holiday season fast approaching, retail stocks have been in the spotlight. However, video streaming service provider Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) should be on your radar as well because the firm is gearing up for a big year in 2018. NFLX stock already is trading at all-time highs, but don’t be put off by its meteoric rise. The firm still has further to climb. Netflix has a solid game plan for the upcoming year and investors who stick around are likely to be rewarded. One part of Netflix’s business that has gotten a lot of attention has been the firm’s focus on original content. The company has poured billions into developing multiple hit series and that’s expected to continue into 2018. In 2018, NFLX management says it is planning to spend somewhere between $7 billion and $8 billion on programming with an end goal of eventually having original content make up half of it’s total library. That’s a big deal because the benefits of original content versus licensed programs is still unclear. According to Nielsen, original content isn’t actually all that popular when you compare it to “back catalog,” or licensed shows. The ratings service claims that its studies show that people spend only 20% of the time they spend streaming on original content. On the surface, those claims make NFLX’s strategy look frivolous, but there are other factors to consider. First of all, the Nielsen ratings aren’t exactly comprehensive because they only take into account what people are watching on TV, not what they’re watching on tablets, computers and smartphones. Secondly, original content plays a massive role in driving subscriptions and renewals, a huge part of NFLX’s business. With NFLX upping its subscription prices, it is important that the company maintains its place as most-popular streaming service. Many people are willing to pay monthly simply to keep up with some of their favorite shows. As long as Netflix is able to continue producing hit shows, the firm will have greater price elasticity. Another reason I believe NFLX stock price will continue climbing in the year to come is the fact that the firm has a lot of growth opportunities as it pushes its service further afield. Last year Netflix made its service available in 190 countries across the globe, and I think we’ll start to see those investments pay off in the coming year. Because NFLX uses its own customer data to make its service better, it takes time for the firm to gain traction in new markets. Netflix has proven itself to be successful analyzing customer data to determine what provides customers with the most value and tailoring the streaming experience depending on local tastes. The other reason NFLX is likely to be successful in its expansion efforts is that the company’s customer satisfaction ratings have been impressive. That makes it’s free-trial an extremely effective tool in hooking in new subscribers. NFLX’s massive customer database means that the company can provide users with a hard-to-resist value proposition during their trial period.

Source: Shutterstock A few weeks ago, yours truly here opined that Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) was, sooner or later, going to run into a painful wall of competition, at which point years of heavy, excessive content spending (and the subsequent debt it created) would come back to haunt the company, and by extension shake owners of NFLX stock. I didn’t know who or how or when, but nothing breeds competition like a little success. As it turns out, Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) and Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (NASDAQ:FOX) may be the current best bets to do the aforementioned deed. Whispers that the former was looking to buy at least some significant parts of the latter surfaced this week, with the ultimate goal being to stop Netflix in its tracks before it was allowed to develop any more momentum. Yes, it should worry current and would-be owners of NFLX stock, even if this particular rumored deal doesn’t materialize. First and foremost, take the suggestion with a grain of salt. Neither company has confirmed (nor denied) the prospect, and even CNBC pundit/host David Faber’s sources acknowledged there was no actual impending deal. All the same, the premise is credible simply because, when all is said and done, it’s a good idea. Needham analyst Laura Martin commented the potential pairing would be a “dream come true. Putting these assets under Disney’s hands will make them a lot more money. At the end of the day, Fox will get more money than it could have by it operating those businesses and Disney will make more at the outset,” adding that Disney’s content library is of the highest quality, but not terribly big. At the same time, Fox’s library is deep and wide, even if not Disney caliber. Martin went as far as to describe the rumored union as a “Netflix killer,” surmising the two organizations could easily figure out how to clear the technical hurdles of developing an on-demand video platform. Toby Chapman, an associate partner at global strategy consultant OC&C, agreed, saying “It’s a sign of Disney wanting to develop scale in order to compete with Netflix. On its own, it’s difficult for even a company like Disney to compete with breadth of content that Netflix has. You’ve got to have something really broad or something with really specific strengths.” Not everyone agrees. Cowen’s Doug Creutz posited that investors who are bullish on Disney like it for the non-TV assets. “So why would Disney want to increase its exposure to TV? Disney already has plenty of scale, so adding scale isn’t that helpful… In a world where content is getting more valuable, but networks are being devalued, this seems like it would be suicide,” he said. Creutz’s point is well taken, but it’s not necessarily a Disney-Fox deal specifically that should haunt loyal owners of NFLX stock. It’s that conversations like this one — just with different players — are being re-circulated at a faster and faster pace. Sooner or later, enough of that spaghetti will stick to the wall.

Martin went as far as to describe the rumored union as a “Netflix killer,” surmising the two organizations could easily figure out how to clear the technical hurdles of developing an on-demand video platform. Toby Chapman, an associate partner at global strategy consultant OC&C, agreed, saying “It’s a sign of Disney wanting to develop scale in order to compete with Netflix. On its own, it’s difficult for even a company like Disney to compete with breadth of content that Netflix has. You’ve got to have something really broad or something with really specific strengths.” Not everyone agrees. Cowen’s Doug Creutz posited that investors who are bullish on Disney like it for the non-TV assets. “So why would Disney want to increase its exposure to TV? Disney already has plenty of scale, so adding scale isn’t that helpful… In a world where content is getting more valuable, but networks are being devalued, this seems like it would be suicide,” he said. Creutz’s point is well taken, but it’s not necessarily a Disney-Fox deal specifically that should haunt loyal owners of NFLX stock. It’s that conversations like this one — just with different players — are being re-circulated at a faster and faster pace. Sooner or later, enough of that spaghetti will stick to the wall.

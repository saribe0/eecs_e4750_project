NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) unveiled its latest quarterly earnings results after the bell Thursday. The company posted profit of $1.33 per share, which handily topped Wall Street’s consensus estimate of 95 cents per share, according to data compiled by FactSet. Revenue came in at $2.64 billion, topping analysts’ expectations of $2.37 billion and growing 32% year-over-year. On the gaming front, Nvidia saw revenue pop 25% year-over-year to $1.56 billion, making up more than half of the company’s total revenue. Data center chips rose considerably, increasing 109% to $500 million. The company’s revenue was also aided by its data center business, which saw its revenue skyrocket 175% year-over-year. There was a higher demand from large-scale customers working on artificial intelligence, according to Nvidia. The demand for the company’s graphics chips linked to cryptocurrencies also soared as the price for bitcoin and ethereum have continued to gain traction. Nvidia also said it will increase its dividend from 14 cents to 15 cents per share. The company had been leasing the land for its new headquarters in Santa Clara, California, and it announced that it was now buying the land for about $350 million. Its previous headquarters were in Wachovia. “We had a great quarter across all of our growth drivers,” said CEO Jensen Huang in a statement during the company’s press release. “Industries across the world are accelerating their adoption of AI,” he added at the earnings call. NVDA stock surged 2.6% after the bell Thursday. Article printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2017/11/nvidia-corporation-nvda/. ©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC

Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and NVIDIA Corporation NVDA may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report. That is because NVIDIA is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for NVDA in this report. In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 95 cents per share for NVDA, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 94 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for NVDA, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.71% heading into earnings season. NVIDIA Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   NVIDIA Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | NVIDIA Corporation Quote Why is this Important? A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here). Given that NVDA has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for NVIDIA, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report. Wall Street’s Next Amazon  Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius. Click for details >> Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Nvidia (NVDA) is scheduled to report third quarter fiscal 2017 earnings results after Thursday’s closing bell. For the three months that ended October, Wall Street expects the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company to earn 94 cents per share, up 13% year-over-year, on revenue of $2.36 billion, up 18% year over year. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings were 83 cents per share on revenue of $2.00 billion. For the full year, ending in December, earnings of $3.63 per share would rise about 41%, while full-year revenue of $8.97 billion would rise 30% year over year. With its shares skyrocketing almost 100% year-to-date and well-perched above $200 per share, the semiconductor giant has high expectations to live up to and its own big shoes to fill. But thanks to successes in high-growth markets like artificial intelligence (AI), where Nvidia chips are at the center of autonomous driving technology, the company has posted breathtaking top- and bottom-line growth results, which has crushed Wall Street's estimates the past two years. In the second quarter, Nvidia made a case for why it belongs in the FANG category by crushing Q2 profit estimates by 31 cents as earnings per share grew by a whopping 124% year over year. Just as impressive, revenue growth surged 56% to $2.23 billion, topping the consensus estimates of $1.96 billion, driven by a 52% rise in gaming revenue. The company is also showing more balance and diversification as the datacenter business — the company’s second-largest target market platform by revenue — surged 175%. Will there be any slowdown this quarter? Obviously, triple-digit revenue growth can’t go on forever. But will any growth deceleration be enough to incite investors fear? Earlier this week, Craig Ellis analyst at B. Riley FBR reiterated his Buy rating on Nvidia stock and raised his 12-month price target to $250 from $200, suggesting 20% rise from current levels. This upgrade followed a similar bullish assessment from Jefferies semiconductor analyst Mark Lipacis, who last month reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and upped his 12-month price target from $180 to $230. Lipacis cited Nvidia’s AI chip, which he described as a key catalyst for “upside surprises over the next 18-24 months.” Elsewhere the strength of cryptocurrencies and the crypto-mining crave it has created. To which Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh last month argued that NVDA shares will continue to benefit from “strong underlying trends in cryptocurrency and gaming,” which he notes are ahead of the company’s expectations. “We believe NVDA continues to see strong GPU [graphics processing unit] trends in cryptocurrency and gaming. GPU pricing remains up post-launch (of its new graphics chip) given shortage and strong demand,” Rakesh wrote in a note to investors. All told, you would be hard-pressed to find a stronger-executing company today than Nvidia, which despite increased competitive pressures from Intel (INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), the company is seemingly operating on all cylinders. While these shares are screaming bargains today, I’m not holding my breath waiting for them to become cheap — not with such strong winds in Nvidia’s sails.

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Time to Sell? Overall, the bias in prices is: Upwards. Short term: Prices are moving. Intermediate term: Prices are trending. Note: this chart shows extraordinary price action to the upside. By the way, prices are vulnerable to a correction towards 190.32. The projected upper bound is: 215.77. The projected lower bound is: 196.46. The projected closing price is: 206.11.  Candlesticks A white body occurred (because prices closed higher than they opened).
During the past 10 bars, there have been 7 white candles and 3 black candles for a net of 4 white candles. During the past 50 bars, there have been 28 white candles and 22 black candles for a net of 6 white candles. A doji star occurred (where a doji gaps above or below the previous candle). This often signals a reversal with confirmation occurring on the next bar. A falling window occurred (where the bottom of the previous shadow is above the top of the current shadow). This usually implies a continuation of a bearish trend. There have been 4 falling windows in the last 50 candles–this makes the current falling window even more bearish. A long lower shadow occurred. This is typically a bullish signal (particularly when it occurs near a low price level, at a support level, or when the security is oversold). Momentum Indicators Momentum is a general term used to describe the speed at which prices move over a given time period. Generally, changes in momentum tend to lead to changes in prices. This expert shows the current values of four popular momentum indicators. Stochastic Oscillator One method of interpreting the Stochastic Oscillator is looking for overbought areas (above 80) and oversold areas (below 20). The Stochastic Oscillator is 60.7155. This is not an overbought or oversold reading. The last signal was a sell 0 period(s) ago. Relative Strength Index (RSI) The RSI shows overbought (above 70) and oversold (below 30) areas. The current value of the RSI is 61.93. This is not a topping or bottoming area. However, the RSI just crossed below 70 from a topping formation. This is a bearish sign. A buy or sell signal is generated when the RSI moves out of an overbought/oversold area. The last signal was a sell 0 period(s) ago. Commodity Channel Index (CCI) The CCI shows overbought (above 100) and oversold (below -100) areas. The current value of the CCI is 6. This is not a topping or bottoming area. The last signal was a sell 1 period(s) ago. MACD The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence indicator (MACD) gives signals when it crosses its 9 period signal line.

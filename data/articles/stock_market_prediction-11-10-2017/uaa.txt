 When the Seawolves needed a spark to close out Thursday's volleyball match against Western Oregon, outside hitter Leah Swiss answered the call.  The junior hammered two straight kills and provided a solo block on match point to seal UAA's 25-23, 25-21, 25-22 sweep of the Wolves at the Alaska Airlines Center.  The Seawolves (17-9, 12-5 Great Northwest Athletic Conference) received 12 kills and 15 digs from Junior outside hitter Chrisalyn Johnson for her 10th double-double of the season, and Swiss added nine kills, a career-high 21 digs, three aces and two blocks.  UAA jumped out to big leads in the first two sets only to have Western Oregon (6-18, 2-15) fight back each time in a match that was closer than a sweep suggests.  In the first set, UAA led 5-6 before the Wolves began chipping away. Three straight Western Oregon kills made it 22-22, and Swiss was blocked by Leila Holt to give the Wolves a 23-22 lead. Swiss responded with a kill of her own and Hayes smacked back-to-back kills to clinch the set.  After leading 14-6 in the second, UAA saw its lead sliced to 20-18 on a kill from Western Oregon's Katherine Huntington. But the Seawolves answered with a 3-0 run — highlighted by a combo block from Vanessa Hayes and Anais Vargas — to stem the tide and hold on, 25-21.  The third set was the closest with neither team leading by more than three points the whole way. The match was tied at 22-22 before Swiss' back-to-back kills and solo block ended the match.  "That was far from our best effort, but I also give Western Oregon a lot of credit for playing great defense and making things hard for us," UAA coach Chris Green said in a press release. "Luckily some of our veterans stepped up at key points in the match enough to get us the win."  The Wolves were led by outside hitter Alisha Bettinson (15 kills), libero Libbie Hoene (22 digs) and outside hitter Sierra Stultz (5 aces), but they were outhit .173 to .093.  Heading into the week, Green said UAA will likely need to win out to have a shot at the West Region tournament.  The Seawolves have three matches remaining, all at the Alaska Airlines Center, with a 1:30 p.m., Saturday showdown against Concordia next on tap.

In 2010, Alaska’s lawmakers were working to overhaul the state’s criminal justice reform system. At the time, former Governor Sean Parnell was launching his Choose Respect Initiative, a campaign to end the epidemic of domestic violence, sexual assault, and child sexual abuse in the state. His administration tapped the University of Alaska Anchorage’s Justice Center to help provide research and data to measure the effectiveness of the campaign. Many statewide agencies were involved, from criminal justice to health organizations, including the Alaska Mental Health Trust Authority (AMHTA). The AMHTA’s former director, Jeffrey Jessee, now UAA’s vice provost of Health Programs and dean of the College of Health (COH), realized the value of UAA’s Justice Center’s data and research, and reached out to former Justice Center director André Rosay, now the associate dean of Academic and Student Affairs in the COH. The two discussed how the Justice Center could be more involved in providing data to lawmakers to help them make more informed policy decisions regarding criminal justice. Throughout the Choose Respect campaign, Jessee and Rosay worked closely and the idea of an independent center, focused solely on criminal justice data, was formed. The two pooled their resources to bring their idea to fruition and with help from the AMHTA, the Alaska Legislature and the university, the Alaska Justice Information Center (AJiC) was established in 2015. “The Justice Center has a long history of being the independent fact-finder,” Jessee said. “AJiC is just continuing that work.” A need for data Fast forward to 2017 and AJiC has already had a busy first two years, releasing their first big report, the  Alaska Results First Initiative earlier this fall. “I think it’s critically important now and into the future for what we refer to as ‘evidence-based policymaking,’” said Brad Myrstol, interim director of the UAA  Justice Center (or AJiC Director), explaining why AJiC is important not only to UAA but to Alaska as well. “Particularly in the area of criminal justice—but I think in other policy domains as well.” Myrstol said that using data to make evidence-based policy decisions is not just an Alaska trend, but a national one. Lawmakers nationwide are digging deeper to answer questions on social issues, criminal justice reform and the effectiveness of programs supporting these issues. They are complicated topics and take the efforts of multiple government and non-government organizations to answer—answers that often take years when lawmakers are trying to make policy decisions in real-time. “I think historically in Alaska and elsewhere, criminal justice has not been very evidence-based,” Myrstol said. “So policies, like crime control, are developed on gut-feel, rather than sitting back and collecting the best data you can.” For Myrstol, that’s where he believes AJiC is uniquely positioned, to not only provide research in a more timely manner but to help lawmakers make better, more informed decisions when creating policy that affects Alaskans statewide. Building a platform “What we’re really tackling head on this year is building out what we refer to as an ‘integrated justice data platform,” said Myrstol. The idea, he said, is that AJiC will serve as a repository for justice data that is routinely being collected by criminal justice agencies in Alaska. These data, Myrstol explained, will be permanently housed within the new AJiC justice platform. Myrstol and his staff will use these data to take a comprehensive look at current programs, or help answer complicated questions lawmakers may have, regarding criminal justice policy. In the past, Myrstol said that answering what was a seemingly simple policy question about a law or program’s effectiveness, took tremendous effort and was a process that could take years. What’s unique about AJiC’s role, is the center’s ability to quickly access data from different justice agencies and create more real-time reports, so policymakers are better informed and can make evidence-based decisions regarding criminal justice. “The real innovation here is that the data from the different silos of the justice system will be in one place so we can integrate them,” said Myrstol. “That’s important because often times policymakers ask complicated questions that are difficult for any one entity to answer.” Additionally, AJIC will be looking at other statewide organizational data, like healthcare or education, which Myrstol admits, does not seem like it is related to criminal justice, but often, the programs and policies within these organizations have direct implications for criminal justice. An example, Myrstol said, is Alaska’s juvenile justice division, which is under the Department of Health and Social Services. By looking more deeply into early development programs for troubled youth and evaluating their effectiveness, lawmakers can make better decisions on creating or updating programs to help keep youth out of the juvenile court system, and ultimately out of the adult criminal justice system altogether. “Policy is being developed and implemented with an eye toward evidence at each stage,” Myrstol said. “So thinking about what programs we want to establish in criminal justice, healthcare or K-12 to higher education—how can we use data to inform what programs should be established?” Policy-making paradigm shift As criminal justice reform in Alaska and across the nation is moving toward a more evidence-based model of creating policy, Myrstol, Jessee and Rosay believe that AJiC’s contribution will become more important. “The university is uniquely positioned to provide that substantive and technical expertise that the state needs, now more than ever, to inform public policy decisions,” said Myrstol. Jessee echoes Myrstol’s sentiment saying that the establishment of AJiC is important because it is a statewide tool for policymakers and the public to make informed decisions on tough issues like criminal justice. Whether lawmakers are looking at crime rates in the city, programs aimed at helping troubled youth, or looking at domestic violence and sexual assault—AJiC will be able to provide timely, reliable and valid data that specifically speak to those policy challenges. Stemming from the Choose Respect campaign, Jessee and Rosay helped put Justice Center data on the map for Alaska’s legislators, who realized the importance of being able to make informed, evidence-based decisions regarding policy. AJiC’s work in the future will continue to reflect independent, data-driven work that can be used statewide to make policy decisions regarding criminal justice reform. “Our violence against women work is one example where we were able to show how the Justice Center can inform policy and policymaking,” said Rosay. “While we don’t advocate for specific bills or legislation—we can certainly inform legislators and the public about what strategies are effective and which are not.

After previously competing in four games for the regular season, the UAA hockey team made their conference debut last weekend, Nov. 3-4. UAA traveled to Michigan for back-to-back games against Lake Superior State. Prior to the weekend duel, both teams had a total of five loses for the season, with Lake Superior State only leading the Seawolves by one win. However, Lake Superior got a head start with their Western Collegiate Hockey Association games, with one more than UAA. Post-games, both the Seawolves and Lake Superior sit near the bottom of the standings of WCHA standings at eighth and seventh, respectively. At the top of the standings is Bowling Green State University, with three conference wins and one conference loss. Right behind them is Minnesota State and Northern Michigan. The Seawolves got off to an exceptionally slow start on Friday. The first period resulted in no points made by either team. It wasn’t until the last 30 seconds of the second period that UAA took over. Junior forward Nicolas Erb-Ekholm used a power play to score the first UAA goal of the night and his second goal of the season. Erb-Ekholm’s goal wouldn’t have been possible if it weren’t for Nathan and Jonah Renouf assisting the play. The Seawolves maintained their lead for the majority of the second period until Lake Superior’s Anthony Nellis scored at nearly 17 minutes in the second period, bringing the game to a tie. Not long after, a power-play goal took Lake Superior into the lead, early in the third period. UAA’s freshman defenseman Cameron Trott scored late in the third period, with the power-play score tying it up for the rest of the third. Lake Superior’s Max Humitz scored at 3:38 in the first overtime to overtake the Seawolves, and win the game 3-2. UAA came back Saturday to seek redemption. After the Game 1 loss, the Seawolves made a comeback with a win of 4-1. The start of the game resulted in senior forward Tad Kozun being the first to score for the night, barely a minute into the game. His goal served as a rebound from the attempted shot by junior forward Cam Amantea. Tanner Johnson also assisted on the goal. Similar to the first period of the Friday night game, the second period of Saturday’s game stood at a stand still, without either team making a point. It wasn’t until just two minutes into the third period that the Seawolves came back strong. Senior forward Austin Azurdia managed to get his first goal of the night that put UAA up 2-0, assisted by defensemen Eric Sinclair and goaltender Olivier Mantha. For another four minutes, the Seawolves kept their defense up and maintained the 2-0 lead. Six minutes later, Lake Superior’s Jake Hand managed a power play that put the game a 2-1. Quickly after, junior forward Jeremiah Luedtke and Kozun initiated a set-up for Azurdia to successfully make his second goal of the night. The Seawolves regained their two point lead, and had less than 10 minutes in the game. Luedtke still managed to put in one more goal before the end of the night to close out the game win with just two minutes remaining. The win couldn’t have happened without the 34 saves accumulated by senior goaltender Mantha. With one win and one loss for the weekend, the Seawolves currently sit at a tie for eighth in the conference. UAA hockey will be back in action on Nov. 10 and 11 with away games against Alabama-Huntsville. The following weekend the Seawolves will return home to the Sullivan arena to host back-to-back home games versus Michigan Tech.

Under Armour, Inc. (UAA) is an interesting player in the Consumer Goods space, with a focus on Textile – Apparel Clothing. The stock has been active on the tape, currently trading at $11.97, up from yesterday’s close by 0.76%. Given the stock’s recent action, it seemed like a good time to take a closer look at the company’s recent data. Fundamental Analysis No amount of research is complete without a bird’s eye view of the financial data. Under Armour, Inc. (UAA) currently trades with a market capitalization of $5.14 Billion. That value represents a market adjusting for revenues that have been falling by -4.48 % on a quarterly year/year basis as of the company’s last quarterly report. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For UAA, the company currently has $258 Million of cash on the books, which is offset by $297 Million current liabilities. You can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $91.46 Million over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to grow in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $0.19 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 30.83% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors. Technical Analysis We’ve taken a serious look at this stock from a fundamental perspective, but the tale of the tape may offer more hints about what lies under the surface. Looking at the stock’s movement on the chart, Under Armour, Inc. recorded a 52-week high of $33.45. It is now trading 21.48% off that level. The stock is trading $16.06 its 50-day moving average by 4.09%. The stock carved out a 52-week low down at $11.40. In recent action, Under Armour, Inc. (UAA) has made a move of -27.54% over the past month, which has come on weak relative transaction volume. Over the trailing year, the stock is underperforming the S&P 500 by 19.76, and it’s gotten there by action that has been less volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. In terms of the mechanics underlying that movement, traders will want to note that the stock is trading on a float of 14.78% with $370.49 Million sitting short, betting on future declines. That suggests something of the likelihood of a short squeeze in shares of UAA.

https://economicsandmoney.com/2017/11/09/going-through-the-chart-for-under-armour-inc-uaa-3/

Latest evolution in the price of Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE:UAA) stock has been one of the most talked about matter among the interested investors. Many analysts use price trends and patterns to predict future performance, and we can glean some important insights about UAA by examining the chart. How has the stock performed recently? Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE:UAA) in the last month has decreased -27.54%. Shares are now up over the past year, outperforming the broad market by -100% and outperformed a peer group of similar companies by 379%. After the latest session, which saw the stock close at a price of $11.97, UAA sits below its 52-week high. Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE:UAA) has been trading in a bearish manner, based on the relative positions of the stock’s 20 and 200 day moving averages. Momentum indicators 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that UAA may be headed in the future. To do this, analysts often study the speed and magnitude of a stock’s price movements with what are known as momentum indicators. The logic is that as a stock’s momentum slows, it may be nearing key support or resistance levels and possibly the end of a current trend. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for UAA is 28.51%, which suggests that the stock may be primed for a trend reversal or a breakout to the upside. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 8.96%, tells a similar story, and suggests that UAA currently trades in oversold territory. What do the trading volumes reveal? Analysts use volume trends to assess the level of conviction behind a stock’s price changes. When volumes suddenly increase above normal levels, it can be a sign that investors feel very strongly in one way or the other about the future direction of a stock, or may even have access to inside information. Under Armour, Inc. (UAA) average trading volume of 10,014,000 during the past month is 74.53% above its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been more active than usual in the stock in recent times. What do the analysts think? UAA is currently undervalued by -33.76% relative to the average 1-year price target of $18.07 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 3.10, which implies that analysts are generally neutral in their outlook for UAA over the next year. How risky is the stock?  When predicting the future performance for a stock, it’s also important to take into account risk. To do this, analysts often use a stock’s beta, which measures the stock’s volatility relative to the overall market. Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE:UAA) has a beta of 0.05, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are less extreme than the market as a whole. UAA therefore has a below average level of market risk. During the past couple of weeks, UAA average daily volatility was 117.24%, which is -61.04 percentage points higher than the average volatility over the past 100 days.

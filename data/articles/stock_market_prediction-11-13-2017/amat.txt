 Applied Materials, Inc. AMAT is set to report fiscal fourth-quarter 2017 results on Nov 16.  Last quarter, it delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.61%. The company's surprise history has been pretty impressive. It beat estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 2.66%. Notably, on a year-to-date basis, Applied Materials' shares have returned 74.7%, outperforming the industry 's gain of 67.5%.  Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement. Strong Demand for Applied's Services The company has well-differentiated products and high market share, and is efficiently delivering key enabling technology to logic and foundry customers. Service is an important part of Applied's portfolio, which grew significantly in the last quarter. The Applied Global Services (AGS) segment increased 8.6% sequentially and 19.6% year over year. The figure is further expected to increase in the upcoming quarter, driven by improved device and yield performance. The Zacks Consensus estimate for the upcoming quarter for AGS is pegged at $812 million. Strength in Display to Drive Revenues The company has gained considerable success in expanding beyond semiconductors, particularly in display. New display technologies such as OLED are opening new market opportunities for Applied Materials. The available market opportunity is now more than 10 times that of the traditional LCD. In the last quarter, the Display segment was up 4.9% sequentially and 31.0% from the year-ago level. The segment is further expected to perform well driven by significant opportunities coming from investments in areas such as artificial intelligence, big data, cloud infrastructure, Internet of Things (IoT), virtual reality and smart vehicles. The Zacks Consensus estimate for the upcoming quarter for Display segment is pegged at $676 million. However, increasing competition, high fixed-cost structure and customer concentration remain major concerns, which could affect the results in the upcoming quarter. What Our Model Suggests According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP . Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell) stocks are best avoided, especially if these have a negative Earnings ESP. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter . Applied Materials has a Zacks Rank #2 but an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, a combination that does not suggest that the company is likely to beat. Applied Materials, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise   Applied Materials, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Applied Materials, Inc. Quote Other Stocks to Consider We see a likely earnings beat for each of the following companies.

Plug Power Inc. (NASDAQ:PLUG) trades at $2.55 having a market capitalization of $571.1 million. PLUG stock price climbed 88.89% over the past year, yielding a positive weighted alpha of 44.5 percent. Since an alpha above 1 hints at more gains, investors can predict some further rally scope.  Weighted Alpha is used to calculate how much a share has gone up or down over a certain period, normally a year. In general, more thrust is placed on most recent actions by assigning higher weights to it than those assigned to past movements. This assists to give a return figure that has a stronger focus on the most current period and is thus a better measure for short-term analysis. This technique is highly famous among technical analysts. If the stock is up it will have a positively weighted alpha. If the stock price is unchanged its weighted alpha will be smaller. A stock price loss will yield a negatively weighted alpha.  Support is likely to come between $2.51 a share to $2.46 a share level. However, if the PLUG shares go below $2.46 then it would indicate a much weaker market for the company. In that case, its shares would mark a 3.53% decline from the most recent price. The typical day in the last two weeks has seen about a 7.65% volatility. The average volume for Plug Power Inc. (NASDAQ:PLUG) has been 5.41 million shares per day over the past 30 days. PLUG has a 1-week performance of -11.15%. PLUG price is down nearly -25.88% from its 52-week high price of $3.21 a share but is up about 67.45% from its 52-week low price of $0.83 a share.  Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) has seen its price went down by -11.15% over the course of one week. It seems that Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) might see muted action given an ABR of 2.5 or Hold rating. Analysts, on average, seem bullish as they suggest AMAT is worth $3.32 more, giving a target price of $59.68 a share. PLUG share have rallied by 112.5% in percentage terms since the start of the year – and retreated -11.15% in the last month. Volume in the last session has increased compared with PLUG’s average trading volume. We think the increased volume is representative of buyers as it has displayed in many other cases.  AMAT’s Stochastic Oscillator (%D) is at 60.44%. Values of %D line that are above 80 indicate that the security is overbought; prices could well fall in the near future. And the values below 20 that it is oversold indicate prices could very well bounce upwards. The Stochastic Oscillator is a powerful technical tool that is somewhat surprisingly easy to understand. In a basic sense, it is used by technicians to measure the speed or momentum of the price movement. It represents the location of the previous close relative to the price range over a set number of periods. This can be more easily understood, however, by pulling apart the two lines on the stochastic oscillator and explaining the simple underlying mathematical formulas. The first line is called the %K line, which analyzes the actual price movements in the shares and can be defined as: %K = (Current Close – Lowest Low)/(Highest High – Lowest Low) * 100. The second line, the %D line is simple a 3-day moving average of the %K line. There are three primary ways to read the Stochastic Oscillator in search of entry points, but traders should follow the %D line closely because that indicates major trends on the chart.  Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT)’s latest quote $56.36 $0.04 1.59% will find technical support in $55.61 a share and a breakdown below this region would be a significantly bearish signal for Applied Materials, Inc. traders. Any way you dice it, a dip below $54.86 a share would be very bad news for AMAT’s technical picture in the near-term. The $54.86 level represents at least another 2.66% downside for the stock from its current price. If Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) shares can stay above the price resistance around $56.81 a share, that could help propel Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) higher to the next line of resistance at $57.26 a share. The typical day in the last one month has seen about a 1.97% volatility. AMAT is down around 50.14% from its 12-month high of $28.1 notched on Nov 11, 2016 but is 105.7% above its highest point the past 12 months of $-3.21 a share.

 TORRANCE >> The St. John Bosco football team overcame enough self-inflicted wounds to hold off Bishop Amat in a CIF Southern Section Division 1 first-round victory 35-21 on Friday at El Camino College. Bosco (9-2) led 21-0 at halftime, but committed a bevy of penalties and miscues that allowed Amat (5-6) to cut the lead to seven in the second half. However, Bosco quarterback DJ Uiagalelei led two quick touchdown drives in response to clinch the win. “I like the way we respond to tonight,” Bosco coach Jason Negro said. “When they got the momentum and got close, I thought we did a pretty good job of answering. A lot of credit for that goes to our sophomore quarterback in his fifth start.” Uiagalelei completed 18 of his 23 pass attempts for 307 yards and three touchdowns. Three of the incompletions were dropped balls, and the sophomore added a short rushing touchdown in the second half. He has scored 16 touchdowns in the last five weeks. Bosco junior receivers Josh Delgado and Colby Bowman both went over 100 yards receiving. The game started slowly, and played into Amat’s favor because of Bosco mistakes. The Braves were whistled 12 times for over 140 penalty yards. Amat was called for three penalties. “From an officiating standpoint, ultimately I think the game is just too fast for the guys trying to officiate,” Negro said. “We’re not going to change the way we play. You just got to hope you get better officiating as you go through the playoffs. Right now we have to do a better job of cutting down on the mistakes.” A pass interference call put Amat in the red zone for its first touchdown as running back Damien Moore scored from three-yards out. A roughing the kicker penalty extended the Lancers’ second scoring drive, capped by a 4th down touchdown pass from Blake Archuleta to Rueben Murillo. A bad snap on a punt set up Moore’s second touchdown run of the night to cut the Bosco lead to 28-21 early in the fourth quarter. Uiagalelei ran in his touchdowns five plays later to cap the scoring. Not counting the penalty yards, Bosco held Amat under 300 total yards of offense. Archuleta was 15 of 26 for 172 yards. Moore rushed for 96 yards on 19 carries. “We came here to play hard and that’s what we did, it just wasn’t enough,” Amat coach Steve Hegarty said. “Momentum is overrated. We just didn’t execute when we needed to.” Bosco, the No. 3 seed, is defending CIF-SS and CIF State Open Division champion. The Braves will face Rancho Cucamonga in the second round.

The Bishop Amat football team took advantage of almost every opportunity on Friday in the first round of the CIF Southern Section Division 1 playoffs, but ultimately fell to defending champion and third seed St. John Bosco, 35-21, at El Camino College. “We came here to play hard and that’s what we did, it just wasn’t enough,” Amat coach Steve Hagerty said. “Momentum is overrated. We just didn’t execute when we needed to.” After falling behind 21-0 at halftime, Amat (5-6) was able to cut the Bosco lead to seven in the second half while the Braves fell victim to their own penalties and miscues. However, Bosco quarterback DJ Uiagalelei orchestrated two quick touchdown drives in response to clinch the win. “I like the way we responded tonight,” Bosco coach Jason Negro said. “When they got the momentum and got close, I thought we did a pretty good job of answering.

        Morgan Stanley reiterates its Overweight rating for Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and presents a $2K per share bull case that would give the e-commerce giant a $1T market cap.                Analyst Brian Nowak cites the company’s high margins and the forward performance of five segments: first-party ((1P)), third-party ((3P)), AWS, Subscription, and Advertising/Other as the tailwinds for the bull case.                 Nowak’s math is based on estimating sales growth for each of the key segments up to 2022. His estimates put the core 1P business at $600B and AWS at $270B.                 Amazon shares are up 0.38% to $1,129.60.   See all stocks on the move »

Its early November and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is already gearing up for the holidays — and that’s joyful news for AMZN stock. In addition to adding 120,000 temporary workers to help fulfill orders, Amazon is also cutting prices on items sold by third-party sellers, rolling out an Etsy Inc (NASDAQ:ETSY) competitor, and discounting ultra-popular smart home products. All together, the moves set up Amazon to have a dominant holiday 2017 sales showing. Given the already bullish sentiment on AMZN following blowout third quarter numbers, robust holiday 2017 sales numbers should easily propel AMZN stock to new all-time highs. As such, now seems like a great time to get into AMZN stock before the holiday hype gets priced in. Here are the four reasons why I’m bullish on AMZN stock ahead of the holiday shopping season: 1) It’s worth noting that Amazon is hiring 120,000 temporary workers this year to fulfill holiday orders. That is on par with last year’s number and is a sign that Amazon expects yet another strong holiday period. Under-performing retailers like Macy’s Inc (NYSE:M) and Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE:JWN) have seen temporary holiday hire numbers come down in recent years to accommodate for lower holiday sales volume. 2) Amazon is now extending its discounts to products from third-party sellers. Essentially, Amazon plans to list a discounted price for the product on Amazon, pay the full price to the third-party seller, and make up the difference itself. Its called “discount provided by Amazon”. This is a huge move because it will make Amazon the price leading marketplace during the most important time of the year for retail. Marketplaces continue to win out over traditional retail because they offer better prices and a broader selection. Now, Amazon will be the clear price leader in the favorable marketplace sector. Connecting dots, its easy to see how this “discount provided by Amazon” tactic could lead to a huge holiday sales boost for AMZN. 3) Amazon is set for a big boost from the sales of arts and crafts products. Amazon just launched its Handmade Gift Shop, which is a play on the digital arts and crafts market that Etsy dominates. This is a big growth market (revenues are growing nearly 20% year-over-year at Etsy), and Amazon can easily leverage its size, resources, and low-cost base to quickly take market share.

Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) is an interesting player in the Services space, with a focus on Catalog & Mail Order Houses. The stock has been active on the tape, currently trading at $1129.13, down from yesterday’s close by -0.33%. Given the stock’s recent action, it seemed like a good time to take a closer look at the company’s recent data. Fundamental Analysis Money managers are always interested in a company that can find the right recipe of fundamental data because it reflects something important going on underneath the surface. Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) currently trades with a market capitalization of $535.59 Billion. That value represents a market adjusting for revenues that have been growing by 33.72 % on a quarterly year/year basis as of the company’s last quarterly report. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For AMZN, the company currently has $12.77 Billion of cash on the books, which is offset by $6.58 Billion current liabilities. You can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $7.72 Billion over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to grow in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $1.69 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 61.99% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors. Technical Analysis No analysis is ever complete without a thorough survey of a stock’s technical behavior. Looking at the stock’s movement on the chart, Amazon.com, Inc. recorded a 52-week high of $1135.54. It is now trading 6.4099999999999% off that level. The stock is trading $1,003.83 its 50-day moving average by -1128.13%. The stock carved out a 52-week low down at $710.10. In recent action, Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) has made a move of +12.81% over the past month, which has come on Strong relative transaction volume. Over the trailing year, the stock is underperforming the S&P 500 by 19.7, and it’s gotten there by action that has been more volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. In terms of the mechanics underlying that movement, traders will want to note that the stock is trading on a float of 1.35% with $401.33 Million sitting short, betting on future declines. That suggests something of the likelihood of a short squeeze in shares of AMZN.

Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN)'s new feature Amazon Cash allows consumers to add cash to their Amazon account at brick-and-mortar retailers, including thousands of 7-Eleven stores. Customers who still want to use cash to shop online account for 27 percent of all consumers, TechCrunch said in a story.  Loop Capital Markets' Anthony Chukumba maintains a Buy rating on Amazon's stock with an unchanged $1,300 price target. Amazon's new initiative isn't expected to be a "game changer," but is consistent with Amazon's "relentless focus" on making its business platform easier to use for consumers who want to use cash, Chukumba said in a Monday note. (See Chukumba's track record here.)  Amazon should gain market share among consumers with challenged credit, low income and underage consumers, especially ahead of the holiday shopping season, the analyst said.  The process of adding cash to load an Amazon.com balance at 7-Eleven stores was "simple and seamless" and took less than 30 seconds, according to a Loop Capital test of the process. A consumer simply prints their unique Amazon barcode — or hss it available on a smartphone — and pays cash to load the balance. A receipt is then printed for the consumer and an instant e-mail confirmation was delivered. Amazon's stock was trading slightly lower by 0.13 percent early Monday, but is up 50 percent since the start of 2017 and nearly 400 percent over the past five years.

https://amigobulls.com/articles/80458-top-3-earnings-today-amazon-com-inc-microsoft-and-intel-corporation

Shares of Jeff Bezos led Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) have lost momentum ahead of its third-quarter earnings which the company is scheduled to report today after the market close. Amazon stock has been almost in a downtrend since the beginning of last week in spite of having many reasons to climb higher. On top of it, AMZN stock is yet to recover from its post-earnings sell-off in July end. Hence, a lot is riding on the Seattle, Washington based company's Q3 earnings to drive the recovery in Amazon stock and for it resume its uptrend. Investor sentiment is little shaky ahead of earnings on account of the big EPS miss in the last quarter earnings. Coming to Street estimates, analysts expect the eCommerce giant to report a top line of $42.14 billion, which would translate into a good 28.8% YoY revenue growth. While the revenue growth has never been a problem for Amazon, it's the EPS which disappointed investors in the second quarter earnings as the company missed the Street estimate by a massive margin. For the latest quarter, the Street's consensus estimate for EPS is a non-GAAP earnings of 3 cents per share, a drastic drop from the year-ago quarter EPS of  52 cents, implying a 94% YoY decline. There's little doubt in concluding that Amazon stock could see another correction if the company misses on the EPS target again. Though the current earnings whisper for Amazon which is a non-GAAP earnings of 8 cents per share does suggest that it could deliver an earnings beat. Apart from all this, the third quarter earnings would have a special focus on the impact of Whole Foods' acquisition on the online retail giant's financials. Further, the operating income and Q4 guidance are other crucial metrics which could have a big impact on AMZN stock's fortunes. For a detailed preview of the AMZN stock's Q3 earnings and more insights about how to play Amazon stock ahead of earnings, please go through our Amazon earnings preview. The so called 'boring' Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock has outperformed the broader markets with year-to-date returns of nearly 27%. Under the leadership of Satya Nadella, Microsoft has charted new all-time highs and is also presently trading near its all-time highs. MSFT stock has seen a steady rally over the last one month going into earnings, gaining more than 7%. Now, the expectations are really high from the Redmond, Washington-based tech company's Q1 earnings, which it is set to report today after the closing bell. In spite of the recent highs, there are expectations from Q1 earnings to propel the Microsoft stock much higher. Moving on to analyst estimates, Wall Street expects the company to report earnings per share of 72 cents on a revenue of $23.56 billion. The analyst estimates translate to a 5.5% YoY growth in revenue whereas earnings see a decline of 4 cents from the year-ago quarter EPS of 76 cents per share. The recent earnings history has been very good and the earnings whisper for MSFT stock of 76 cents also suggests that the company would deliver a beat and match the last year earnings number. Microsoft stock has run up quite a bit ahead of earnings by its own standards. However, that also elevates the risk in the context of today's earnings announcement. Either way, Microsoft's earnings release promises to be an interesting event today. For those interested, here's a detailed look at what to expect from Microsoft earnings today. The third earnings for the day is of Brian Krzanich led Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), also scheduled after the market close. Shares of the Mountain View, California based semiconductor giant have seen a strong bullish rally after the last quarter earnings and Intel stock is up by nearly 18% over the last three months. This has been very unlike INTC stock from the first half of 2017 when it was largely subdued. The question now is, whether the latest Q3 earnings will set the Intel stock on a new rally or not? First, we shall have a look at the Street estimates. The average analyst EPS estimate for the Chipzilla in Q3 is 80 cents per share same as the last year same quarter EPS number. The chipmaker is expected to deliver a revenue of $15.73 billion which translates to a marginal YoY decline of 0.3%. One of the archrivals of the semiconductor giant, AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) the other day posted strong top line and bottom line numbers. It's been widely discussed AMD is closing down on Intel in the CPU market and mounting a stiff challenge in its near monopoly server market. Now, the onus is on the Chipzilla, to prove that it can fend off the challenge from its much smaller rivals Dr. Lisa Su led AMD. The performance of the CPU and server segment will be closely watched as those are the segments where AMD seems to be gaining traction at the cost of Intel. As we had noted in our recent detailed Intel Q3 earnings preview, while one can expect Intel to deliver another earnings beat, but the chances of any steep gains in Intel stock immediately following the earnings look grim. The earnings whisper number, which is believed to be Street's unofficial view, suggests an EPS of 82 cents, implying a 2 cents earnings beat. Looking for fundamentally strong tech stocks like Apple?

https://qz.com/1113129/amazon-amzn-third-quarter-earnings-shares-soar-after-amazon-beats-expectations/

Amazon has never particularly cared about hitting short-term earnings expectations. But when it does, investors go crazy. Shares of Amazon surged 8% in after-hours trading today (Oct. 26) after the company beat third-quarter expectations. Amazon reported $256 million in profit, roughly comparable to net income in the same quarter a year earlier. It generated $43.7 billion in sales, up 34% year over year and comfortably above the $42 billion in revenue that analysts were expecting. The results mean that Amazon’s sales growth has now accelerated for four straight quarters, a good sign for the company as sales growth in its crucial Amazon Web Services unit has stagnated. AWS, Amazon’s cloud services business and a reliable revenue-generator, contributed $4.6 billion in revenue in the most recent quarter, up 42% from the third quarter of 2017. That’s about the same rate that AWS grew at in the second quarter of this year, and slower than any other quarter in recent years. The main event of Amazon’s third quarter was, of course, the $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods that it completed in August. Amazon said Whole Foods contributed $1.3 billion in sales this past quarter, which ended Sept. 30. Whole Foods reported $3.7 billion in sales in its quarter ended July 2, its last one as an independent public company.

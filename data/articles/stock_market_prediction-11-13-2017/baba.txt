Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE: BABA) has its biggest weekend of the year: Singles Day. While American shoppers are gearing up for Black Friday and Cyber Monday, Chinese shoppers, particularly younger, single shoppers, are celebrating the Chinese version of an anti-Valentine’s Day by snatching up huge deals on Alibaba’s e-commerce platform. Alibaba registered $12 billion in gross merchandise volume in its first two hours of Singles Day sales on Friday, and analysts are expecting this year’s event to be the biggest ever. Citigroup is calling for $23.8 billion in weekend sales, which are expected to peak at a rate of up to 256,000 transactions per second. Those numbers would be huge market movers for most stocks, but Alibaba shares have been on a tear so far in 2017, and expectations are high. Alibaba stock is now up 92.8 percent from its closing price the day before last year’s Singles Day holiday. With those kind of gains already in place, it may take some huge sales numbers to move the stock on Monday, with analysts calling for a roughly 30 percent increase in Singles Day sales. Here’s a rundown of how the stock has traded on Singles Day in the past: For the first time ever, U.S. investors will have a chance to digest the Singles Day numbers over a weekend and watch to see how the Chinese market reacts before the U.S. market opens on Monday.

BABA – Alibaba reports record sales figures for this year’s Singles Day event. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA) on Sunday said its one-day Singles Day sale netted over $25 billion in gross merchandise volume (GMV), smashing last year’s total by a whopping 39%. The vast majority of the sales were generated via BABA’s Taobao marketplace and Tmall brand store. In total, Alibaba saw 1.48 billion transactions during the single 24-hour period. The sales total completely dominates what Black Friday ($3 billion) and Cyber Monday ($3.45 billion) generated in the United States in 2016. The company commented via press release: “More than US$25 billion of GMV in one day is not just a sales figure,” said Daniel Zhang, Chief Executive Officer of Alibaba Group. “It represents the aspiration for quality consumption of the Chinese consumer, and it reflects how merchants and consumers alike have now fully embraced the integration of online and offline retail.” Alibaba Group Holding Ltd shares closed at $186.41 on Friday, up $1.28 (+0.69%). Year-to-date, BABA has gained 112.29%, versus a 17.11% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period. BABA currently has a StockNews.com POWR Rating of A (Strong Buy), and is ranked #1 of 76 stocks in the China category.

WALL STREET: U.S. stocks fell for a second day Friday — the first time that has happened in a record-setting month. Medical device slumped after a Citigroup analyst said Amazon might be on the verge of shaking up their industry by speeding up distribution and cutting prices. Energy companies gave up some recent gains while retailers, media companies and household goods companies moved higher. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index lost 0.1 percent to 2,582.30, finishing the week down 0.2 percent after setting a record Wednesday. The Dow Jones industrial average slid 0.2 percent to 23,422.21. The Nasdaq composite turned higher and rose 0.89 points to 6,750.94. (Source: AP) Top Pick for Monday: Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA) Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA) has grabbed attention from the analysts when it experienced a change of 0.69% in the last trading session to close at $186.41. Alibaba Group Holding Limited on Saturday declared that US$25.3 billion (RMB168.2 billion) of gross merchandise volume (GMV) was settled through Alipay on November 11, 2017, a boost of 39% contrast to 2016. Mobile GMV settled through Alipay accounted for 90% of total GMV. “More than US$25 billion of GMV in one day is not just a sales figure,” said Daniel Zhang, Chief Executive Officer of Alibaba Group. “It represents the aspiration for quality consumption of the Chinese consumer, and it reflects how merchants and consumers alike have now fully embraced the integration of online and offline retail.” A total of 14,952,261 shares exchanged hands during the intra-day trade contrast with its average trading volume of 19.07M shares, while its relative volume stands at 0.78. Relative volume is the comparison of current volume to average volume for the same time of day, and it’s displayed as a ratio. If RVOL is less than 1 it is not In Play on this trading day and Investors may decide not to trade it.  If RVOL is above 2 it is In Play and this is more evidence Investors ought to be in the name.  When stocks are *very* In Play one can see a RVOL of 5 and above.  The higher the RVOL the more In Play the stock is. Day traders strive to make money by exploiting minute price movements in individual assets (usually stocks, though currencies, futures, and options are traded as well), usually leveraging large amounts of capital to do so, therefore they trade on Stocks in Play. In Play Stocks are volatile enough to produce good risk and reward trading opportunities for both bull and bear traders intraday. Most company stocks have very little volatility. They generally move extremely slowly and they only produce big price swings when the company produces good or bad trading results, which may only happen a couple of times a year at best. In deciding what to focus on – in a stock, say – a typical day trader looks for three things: liquidity, volatility and trading volume. Liquidity allows an investor to enter and exit a stock at a good price (i.e. tight spreads, or the difference between the bid and ask price of a stock, and low slippage, or the difference between the predictable price of a trade and the actual price). If a stock does not have good liquidity then it may take some time before a broker is able to negotiate a deal to buy or sell a stock and the broker may not be able to get the sell or buy price that the trader is looking for. This is a problem for day traders and it could mean the difference between a profitable and non-profitable trade. Traders have different rules for what constitutes liquidity and a good guide is the volume of trades and volume of shares that are traded each day. 100,000 shares traded per day would be a minimum for most traders and some require 1,000,000. Trading volume is a gauge of how many times a stock is bought and sold in a given time period (most commonly, within a day of trading, known as the average daily trading volume – ADTV). A high degree of volume indicates a lot of interest in a stock. Often, a boost in the volume of a stock is a harbinger of a price jump, either up or down. Volatility is simply a measure of the predictable daily price range—the range in which a day trader operates. More volatility means greater profit or loss. After a recent check, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA) stock is found to be 1.74% volatile for the week, while 2.26% volatility is recorded for the month. Technical’s Snapshot: The stock has a market cap of $474.15B and the number of outstanding shares has been calculated 2.54B. Based on a recent bid, its distance from 20 days simple moving average is 3.57%, and its distance from 50 days simple moving average is 5.13% while it has a distance of 33.71% from the 200 days simple moving average. The company’s distance from 52-week high price is -2.52% and the current price is 116.73% away from 52-week low price. The company has Relative Strength Index (RSI 14) of 58.61 together with Average True Range (ATR 14) of 4.09. Stock’s Valuation: Past 5 years growth of BABA observed at 58.90%, and for the next five years the analysts that follow this company is expecting its growth at 4.90%. The stock’s price to sales ratio for trailing twelve months is 15.97 and price to book ratio for the most recent quarter is 9.80, whereas price to cash per share for the most recent quarter are 19.07. Its quick ratio for the most recent quarter is 1.70. Analysts mean recommendation for the stock is 1.60.

Alibaba Group Holding (NYSE:BABA) Bulls in Favor Overall, the bias in prices is: Upwards. Short term: Prices are moving. Intermediate term: Prices are trending. Note: this chart shows extraordinary price action to the upside. By the way, prices are vulnerable to a correction towards 173.25. The projected upper bound is: 195.31. The projected lower bound is: 178.10. The projected closing price is: 186.70.  Candlesticks A black body occurred (because prices closed lower than they opened).
During the past 10 bars, there have been 4 white candles and 6 black candles for a net of 2 black candles. During the past 50 bars, there have been 22 white candles and 28 black candles for a net of 6 black candles. A rising window occurred (where the top of the previous shadow is below the bottom of the current shadow). This usually implies a continuation of a bullish trend. There have been 5 rising windows in the last 50 candles–this makes the current rising window even more bullish. A spinning top occurred (a spinning top is a candle with a small real body). Spinning tops identify a session in which there is little price action (as defined by the difference between the open and the close). During a rally or near new highs, a spinning top can be a sign that prices are losing momentum and the bulls may be in trouble. Momentum Indicators Momentum is a general term used to describe the speed at which prices move over a given time period. Generally, changes in momentum tend to lead to changes in prices. This expert shows the current values of four popular momentum indicators. Stochastic Oscillator One method of interpreting the Stochastic Oscillator is looking for overbought areas (above 80) and oversold areas (below 20). The Stochastic Oscillator is 49.5704. This is not an overbought or oversold reading. The last signal was a sell 5 period(s) ago. Relative Strength Index (RSI) The RSI shows overbought (above 70) and oversold (below 30) areas. The current value of the RSI is 59.72. This is not a topping or bottoming area. A buy or sell signal is generated when the RSI moves out of an overbought/oversold area. The last signal was a sell 41 period(s) ago. Commodity Channel Index (CCI) The CCI shows overbought (above 100) and oversold (below -100) areas. The current value of the CCI is 58. This is not a topping or bottoming area. The last signal was a sell 2 period(s) ago. MACD The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence indicator (MACD) gives signals when it crosses its 9 period signal line. The last signal was a buy 8 period(s) ago.

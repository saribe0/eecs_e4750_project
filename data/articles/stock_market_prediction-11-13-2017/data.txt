How brands can use big data without creeping people out Back in the old days, sometime around 1992, the most information that advertisers could glean about you was your age and where you lived. In today's mobile marketplace, that seems almost quaint. Modern media companies and their advertisers can parse each page impression down to almost every single attribute of a viewer. They collect data from across all digital platforms, including phones, tablets, desktops, and televisions, and distill it into specific data groups: "working women over 40 who like tennis and live in the Pacific Northwest"; or "men 18-35 who watch Game of Thrones and pay for online transactions with American Express." Thanks to ongoing digital advancements, you can be sure: Advertisers know you — they really know you. And they can target ads that are personalized just for you and your habits. "When someone visits one of our guides about the best accounting software, we can retarget them on Facebook, Google, and elsewhere with an ad for another piece of content about accounting software, or a direct offer to purchase accounting software," says David Waring, co-founder and editor-in-chief of FitSmallBusiness.com, an online magazine for small business. "This makes the advertising experience much more personalized to the viewer, and can up ad performance substantially." But with big data comes even bigger challenges. Kevin Knight, chief marketing officer of Experticity, says targeted advertising can sometimes freak people out and maybe even turn them off to your product. "You can look at it as the kind of focus that goes into buying a friend the perfect birthday gift," Knight says. "Or you can look at it like the kind of focus a hunter employs when stalking an animal. Too much of today's advertising feels like the latter and unsurprisingly, consumers don't like to feel stalked." That's true. Anyone who's ever Googled a product, or bought something on Amazon, only to have the same product pop up in ads for the next week knows how creepy targeted advertising can feel. Some people are so paranoid about this idea that they believe Facebook is actually listening to their conversations and using the information to serve them ads. Recently the paranoia about this grew to such a fevered pitch that a Facebook executive actually had to come out and publicly deny the rumors. "No, we are not using anyone's microphone to do any of that," said Stan Chudnovsky, vice president of product for Facebook Messenger. "We're also not using the context of your conversations in order to target ads. None of that is happening." Good to know. But as Wired reports, other digital tools, like smart speakers, might not be so innocent. But Knight says not all data leads to creepy personalization, stressing that targeting has to be done in a transparent way. Several platforms, like Hulu and Instagram, regularly ask users which of a given set of ads they prefer. "Self-reported data is generally going to be a better starting point for advertisers than the kind of inferred data that can creep users out," Knight says. "This kind of explicit solicitation of info that helps personalize ads is a win-win." But some companies are hoping big data obtained with the help of the internet will be their magic bullet for instant success. Experts warn ad targeting won't do any good if advertisers don't understand their brand. "Personalization is transactional. Brands are emotional," says Susan Credle, chief global creative officer of global advertising agency FCB. She created Allstate's "Mayhem" campaign and M&M's iconic walking, talking characters. "If you don't get [the branding] right, you should just put everything on hold." Indeed, having so much information about potential customers at their fingertips may actually be making advertisers lazy. If the product isn't any good (or consumers have no interest in it), no amount of target marketing will convince them to buy. Instead of over-relying on big data, brands should allow it to enhance their advertising, not drive it entirely. "Just because we can doesn't mean we should," says Janet Balis, a partner and leader of EY's global advisory media and entertainment group. "We need to lean into our creative side and ask ourselves: Is this an effective storytelling technique? Will it delight, engage, and inform consumers?" Overall, the expert advice to brands testing the personalization waters seems to be this: Take your foot off the gas and think not just about who you want to reach, but why. "If people think they need a fly swatter to get rid of you, that's not how you build a relationship," Credle says. "Amazon, for example, keeps track of all your orders. When I needed a replacement light bulb, I could look at my past orders and find the exact bulb I needed. They use their data to my advantage, not just to their advantage. Once I feel you are using my information for your gain, then you're done."

 For some people, Google controls most of their identity online, and losing access to that critical account could be devastating. A recent study from Google and UC Berkeley examined the various ways accounts are compromised, and determined that phishing attacks – not data breaches – pose the most risk to users when it comes to lost access. Google's study lasted a year, from March 2016 until March 2017, and looked to better understand how attackers take over accounts. While phishing, keylogging, and data breaches impact everyone, Google focused on themselves as the case study. [ Check out these 11 phishing prevention tips for best technology practices, employee education and social media smarts. | Get the latest from CSO by signing up for our newsletters. ] "What we learned from the research proved to be immediately useful," two of the study's authors, Kurt Thomas and Angelika Moscicki, explained. In fact, the data helped secure some 67 million Google accounts before they could be abused.  Google's study includes data taken from 25,000 malicious tools used for phishing and keylogging, which enabled the researchers to identify 788,000 compromised credentials due to keyloggers; 12 million credentials compromised via phishing; and 3.3 billion credentials exposed due to data breaches. Google said the majority of those using phishing kits and keyloggers to compromise credentials are concentrated in Nigeria, followed by the United States, Morocco, South Africa, United Kingdom, and Malaysia. That finding hits close to home. Recently, CSO has been tracking a number of Office 365 phishing attacks, which use compromised accounts to further their reach. Many of the attacks that landed in our inboxes can be sourced back to Nigeria.  While some phishing kits are basic, they serve an essential function; namely, they often lead users to believe there is a problem, and look just convincing enough to fool someone into sharing their password and other identifying information.  Some of the phishing kits observed by Google were collecting additional details, including IP address, device make and model, phone numbers, and location – things Google might request for ID verification. Data collected by Google shows that 80-percent of all the phishing kits observed targeted usernames, passwords, and geolocation; followed by phone numbers and device details. A smaller subset of the phishing kits also targeted secret questions, full names, credit card data, and Social Security Numbers. For this reason, Google explained, it was determined that phishing posed the greatest threat, followed closely by keylogging. Based on the data, Google said that only seven percent of the passwords exposed by a data breach were still being used by their users, compared to 12 or 25-percent of the passwords exposed by phishing or keylogging. As such, in the grand scheme of things, while having a large impact on services where password reuse is common, data breaches ranked last. During the study's timeline, Google determined that, unfortunately, most users who fell victim to a phishing attack remained unaware that their account was at risk. However, one upside to the data collected is that most victims are only impacted once, as only two percent of those in the dataset were successfully phished a second time. Taking all of the data into account, Gmail, followed by Yahoo and Hotmail respectively, were the top three domains for phishing and keylogging victims. A majority of the phishing victims reside in the United States, while the keylogging victims are mostly in Brazil and India. Ranked in order, Google's study shows that Gmail, Yahoo, and Hotmail were the top brands impersonated, followed by workspace email accounts, Dropbox, Google Drive, DocuSign, ZoomInfo, Office 365, and AOL. The study also makes note that while two-factor authentication would help mitigate problems associated with phishing, there are serious hurdles to wide-adoption, including ease of use, recovery from loss, and getting consumers to trust third-parties. Google presented their findings during the Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS), a full copy is available online.  More on phishing: Steve Ragan is senior staff writer at CSO. Prior to joining the journalism world in 2005, Steve spent 15 years as a freelance IT contractor focused on infrastructure management and security.

Nobody wants to become the victim of hackers who compromise online accounts, yet it’s something that 15 percent of internet users have reported experiencing. Following a year-long study by Google and UC Berkeley, we know that data breaches are the most popular method of stealing users’ credentials, but phishing scams are more dangerous because of the extra information that’s exposed. From March 2016 to March 2017, Google and UCB trawled public and private hacker forums and paste sites to search for stolen log-in names, passwords, and other account details. Google said the investigation showed how this information was obtained. It turns out that data breaches are the most common way for user credentials to leak online, which isn’t that surprising, given their regularity and size. Prominent breaches such as those by Yahoo, LinkedIn, and MySpace contributed to 1.9 billion records being leaked, most which were being traded on private forums. 12 million credentials were obtained though phishing kits, while 780,000 credentials came from keyloggers. 12 percent of the records exposed through data breaches used Gmail addresses, and 7 percent of these cases saw the same password used for both accounts. The success rate is higher when using phishing and keyloggers: 12 – 25 percent of passwords obtained using these attacks yielded valid passwords. Around 234,000 valid names and passwords are obtained through phishing every week, whereas keyloggers yielded about 15,000 valid credentials each week.  In terms of risk to the user, phishing was the greatest threat, followed by key loggers then third-party breaches. While the victim of a data breach is ten times more likely to have their account taken over than a random Goole user, someone who falls for a phishing scam is 400 times more at risk. This is because of the way phishing kits obtain information such as secret questions, device identifiers, geolocations, IP addressed, and phone numbers. Over 4000 distinct phishing kits were discovered during the study, the most popular of which emulates Gmail, Yahoo, and Hotmail login pages. Most of the kits originate from African and East-Asian countries, with Nigeria having the highest concentration of operators. While it’s not infallible, two-factor authentication remains the best way to protect your online accounts. If you want even more protection, there's U2F USB security key support for accounts such as Facebook, Google, and Dropbox.

KUALA LUMPUR: CIMB Group Holdings Bhd (CIMB) today announced that several magnetic tapes containing back-up data were lost in transit during routine operations.  Some of these tapes contain customer information of CIMB Bank and its subsidiaries.  The bank said following a thorough and ongoing assessment, there is currently no evidence that any of this information has been compromised.  "The tape data does not contain any authentication data such as PINs, passwords or credit card CVV numbers," CIMB said in a statement today.  It said in adopting a conservative approach to data protection and security, the bank is working with all the relevant authorities and taking all necessary measures to protect its customers.  "As these are back-up tapes, CIMB still has all customer information," it said.  In response to this incident, CIMB has heightened security measures across all channels, including temporarily suspending some services via its call centre such change of address, telephone number and/or email address for banking/credit cards; third party fund transfer or payment for customers without T-Pin; and T-Pin creation or requests.  The bank advised that whilst no action is required on the part of customers, CIMB recommends that customers be extra vigilant and when in doubt, refer only to official CIMB channels such as its website, call centre and branches.  “We take our responsibility to our customers very seriously and we are confident the measures we have put in place will maintain the safety of customer transactions.  "Although this was an isolated incident, we have reviewed and further strengthened our security and internal processes to ensure that we remove the possibility of it recurring,” said CIMB Group Holdings Bhd chief executive officer Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Tengku Aziz.  "We apologise for the inconvenience that our heightened security measures may cause to our customers in the interim.  "Know that we are working very closely with all relevant authorities to mitigate any risk arising from this incident," he said.  In a separate statement, Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) said it is aware of the incident involving the loss of backup tapes in transit by CIMB. BNM was assured by CIMB Bank that necessary precautionary measures and mitigation actions have been taken to manage any possible negative impact arising from the loss of the tapes. Members of the public are advised to continue to be vigilant in safeguarding their personal information, it said.

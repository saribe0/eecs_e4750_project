 I use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of varying growth rates for the company’s cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a more stable growth phase. To begin with we have to get estimates of the next five years of cash flows. For this I used the consensus of the analysts covering the stock, as you can see below. I then discount this to its value today and sum up the total to get the present value of these cash flows.  Present Value of 5-year Cash Flow (PVCF)= $35,413  We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after the five years. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at an annual growth rate equal to the 10-year government bond rate of 2.5%. We discount this to today’s value at a cost of equity of 14.7%.  Terminal Value (TV) = FCF2021 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = $9,993 × (1 + 2.5%) ÷ (14.7% – 2.5%) = $83,403 Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV) = TV / (1 + r)5 = $83,403 / ( 1 + 14.7%)5 = $41,924   The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the cash flows, which in this case is $77,337. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. If the stock is an depositary receipt (represents a specified number of shares in a foreign corporation) then we use the equivalent number. This results in an intrinsic value of $59.17, which, compared to the current share price of $73.46, we see that Gilead Sciences is fair value, maybe slightly overvalued and not available at a discount at this time.   The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don’t agree with my result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. Because we are looking at Gilead Sciences as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighed average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation I’ve used 14.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.631. This is derived from the Bottom-Up Beta method based on comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.   Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn’t be the only metric you look at when researching a company. What is the reason for the share price to differ from the intrinsic value?

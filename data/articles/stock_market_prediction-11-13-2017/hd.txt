https://www.wired.com/2017/11/review-amazon-fire-hd-8-kids-edition-2017/

It happens to every parent. Maybe you’re on the treadmill after work and realize that you’re singing the Chuggington theme song while running. Or you’re at a dinner party, engaging in fluid discourse on the world-building in Zootopia versus Kung Fu Panda. Your family has become a hive mind. Whatever media your children consume, you also consume—and not only is this not a bad thing, it is also probably a hallmark of responsible parenting. The Amazon Fire HD 8 Kids Edition is the affordable tablet that will provide the maximum amount of enjoyment to the most members in your family, which is something to consider if you have children of different ages using the same tablet, or if you, the parent, let yourself get snookered into watching one more episode of Little Baby Bum before bed.  The first difference that you will see between Amazon’s 7- and 8-inch tablets is the larger, clearer HD display. While your toddler might not notice, you and older children will appreciate that extra inch of color and clarity when watching movies or playing games. Minecraft (for older kids) and the Sago Mini games (for younger ones) were bright and immersive, and played without any noticeable lag time.   The second difference is the sound. Unlike the Fire 7 for Kids, the Fire 8 for Kids has two Dolby Atmos speakers, instead of one, and they are not largely obscured by the included puffy child-proof case. The difference in volume and clarity is immediate and shocking. Going from one to the other is like taking cotton balls out of your ears.  The third is the battery life. My run test of watching videos and surfing took a little over the advertised twelve hours to use the entire battery. But twelve hours of battery life is a looooong time, with curfews installed and each child profile—you can set two parents and up to four children per device—limited to one hour of tablet time per day. Three days of toddler usage and parent fiddling barely dented the battery life, which went down to a mere 76%.  Durable. Affordable. Plenty of content to please all ages, even those who are well over 12. Parental controls are strict, but easily adjusted (by the parent). Can easily monitor the usage of multiple kids. Hard to smuggle in non-Amazon content. Camera isn’t very good. And like the Fire 7 for Kids, the Fire 8 for Kids also offers the same two-year worry-free guarantee and a year’s free subscription to FreeTime Unlimited, the subscription platform that gives your child access to a spectacular array of age-appropriate books, games, apps and videos from ages three to twelve. For example, when I created a ten-year-old child profile, every Harry Potter book immediately showed up, as well as Tolkien’s The Silmarillion and other classics like Tron. So I can guarantee that your child will be thrilled, as long as your child is also me.  As with the Fire 7 Kids, however, my main gripe is with the parental controls. Most parents buy the kids editions for their ability to keep their children from running rampant through all the dark and seedy corners of the Internet. The controls are incredibly customizable by accessing settings on your parent profile. You can choose as many or as few restrictions on your child’s FreeTime profile as you like. You can block the camera, block in-app purchasing, and monitor your child’s usage via the FreeTime app on the parent profile or online.  The problem arises when you try to watch or play something that is not part of the Amazon universe. While FreeTime offers an amazing array of content, and you can access even more goodies if you have a Prime subscription—let’s be honest, if you’re looking at a Fire you probably already have one—fighting your way out of Amazon’s clutches is a struggle.  While younger children, and probably most adults, would be happy with Amazon’s content, older kids will want apps like YouTube Kids. It is possible to transfer a lot of things into the child’s FreeTime profile, but prepare to spend some time puzzling through the workarounds, especially if you make the seemingly reasonable assumption that parental controls don’t apply to the parent profiles. Get used to typing your parental password and PIN a lot of times as you install everything twice—first on your profile, then on theirs.  Also, downloading everything necessary to get the Google Play store up and running took up a significant proportion of the 26.57 GB of usable internal storage. If you have multiple children downloading movies and games, you will probably need to buy an SD card.  Finally, the camera is still not good. Pictures were fuzzy, which is even more noticeable on the larger screen. But it does have a mic, and grandparents on Skype probably won’t mind that that those tiny little faces aren’t as clear as they might otherwise be. Even the strictest of parents has to admit that there is some basic injustice being done to our tiny people, who watch us check Twitter all day on our portable screens as we tell them, hey, play with this little wooden car. The Fire HD 8 Kids Edition is a useful compromise of a device—durable, enjoyable, and at $130, way cheaper than an iPad mini (Amazon is also fond of putting these on sale frequently, so check often for deals).  And as far as parenting goes, it is probably better in the long run that the nannyware is harder, rather than easier, to get around. Who needs a billion KIDZ BOP videos anyway? Just read The Silmarillion instead! No? Really? When you buy something using the retail links in our product reviews, we earn a small affiliate commission. Read more about how this works.

https://www.slashgear.com/irig-mic-hd-2-review-12507678/

There are likely tons of reasons you’d want a dedicated microphone. If you’re podcasting or producing voice-overs for YouTube videos, they’re a must have item. But there are still other reasons to get one, and the iRig Mic HD 2 might just be the best of the bunch. While it has its limitations, it builds atop the company’s already solid reputation, and does so with aplomb. 
  iRig made a point to craft a professional-grade mic this time around. While its predecessor was plastic, the HD 2 has a metal body. It inspires even more confidence in-hand than the original, and keeps its classic microphone form-factor. Because we’re now moving into a world of port ubiquity, the HD 2 also has an audio input, and volume control. It’s analog, though, so if you’ve already migrated to Lightning or USB-C, you’re out of luck. Wirelessly connecting to your iPhone or iPad may be the best bet, here. iRig also thought to include a stand alongside its mic holster this year, and it’s a very solid – if basic – option. The all metal design helps keep the mic steady out of the box, which helps get you up and running straight away. You’ll also get two cables (Lighting to micro-USB and USB-A to micro-USB) and a carrying pouch. Under the hood, it’s impressive. From iRig: iRig Mic HD 2 delivers incredible performance giving you the ability to record your instruments or vocal performances with 24-bit resolution and sample rates up to 96kHz. It utilizes a high-quality, gold-sputtered electret condenser capsule that ensures exceptional transient and frequency response (20 Hz – 20 kHz, -3 dB) along with enhanced durability, and the integrated low-noise preamp lets you dial in just the right amount of gain for the optimum signal level. Able to withstand a maximum sound pressure of 125dB, iRig Mic HD 2 will stand up to recording even very loud sources and the cardioid pickup pattern will help reject unwanted sounds from back side of the microphone.  While using micro-USB for connectivity is likely a legacy holdover from the original, it feels dated. Unfortunately, the only other realistic option would have been USB-C, which needs a bit of time to mature before accessory makers accept it widely. As-is, connecting the iRig Mic HD 2 to an iPhone is a single-cable connection, and there’s no fussing with hardware. You just plug it in and go. You can choose the amount of gain, which is like saying you can choose how sensitive the mic will be. If you’re in a quiet environment and plan to do some voice-over work, more gain might be good. If you’re in an area with a bit of background noise, gain will pick that up. That said, iRig has done a good job of making sure more gain doesn’t equal picking up noise you didn’t hear. Some do, and it’s frustrating. The iRig Mic HD 2 is sitting on my desk a few feet from me, and picks up my voice just fine. The audio input can also be used to re-route to a recorder, mixer or PA system.  I’d like the iRig Mic HD 2 a lot more if it were wireless. Unfortunately, that wouldn’t meet the demands of its target audience, which is where we distill the verdict to. This thing is aimed at pros and pro-sumers. There also needs to be overlap with those who rely on mobile for their recording needs. That’s not a huge market, but this is probably the best kit available for those in that Venn diagram overlap. I chime into the occasional podcast, and use an app called Just Press Record for dictated notes as it does a great job of transcribing. When I do interviews for articles, I tend to use a dedicated microphone. The iRig Mic HD 2 has outperformed expectations on all fronts. If you really need to get serious about recording, iRig has an entire suite of mobile apps that undoubtedly meet your needs – but it’s stellar as a straightforward tool, too. If I have one realistic gripe, it’s that iRig doesn’t provide a hard case for the Mic HD 2. Its bag fits the mic, stand and wires easily, but I’d much rather see this arrive with a small hard case. Forget the presentation packaging and give me a mini case, iRig. But it’s hard not to love the iRig Mic HD 2. It’s better than the original, which was already really good. The iRig Mic HD 2 is on sale directly from iRig for $129 if you’re anxious.

There are likely tons of reasons you’d want a dedicated microphone. If you’re podcasting or producing voice-overs for YouTube videos, they’re a must have item. But there are still other reasons to get one, and the iRig Mic HD 2 might just be the best of the bunch. While it has its limitations, it builds atop the company’s already solid reputation, and does so with aplomb. 
  iRig made a point to craft a professional-grade mic this time around. While its predecessor was plastic, the HD 2 has a metal body. It inspires even more confidence in-hand than the original, and keeps its classic microphone form-factor. Because we’re now moving into a world of port ubiquity, the HD 2 also has an audio input, and volume control. It’s analog, though, so if you’ve already migrated to Lightning or USB-C, you’re out of luck. Wirelessly connecting to your iPhone or iPad may be the best bet, here. iRig also thought to include a stand alongside its mic holster this year, and it’s a very solid – if basic – option. The all metal design helps keep the mic steady out of the box, which helps get you up and running straight away. You’ll also get two cables (Lighting to micro-USB and USB-A to micro-USB) and a carrying pouch. Under the hood, it’s impressive. From iRig: iRig Mic HD 2 delivers incredible performance giving you the ability to record your instruments or vocal performances with 24-bit resolution and sample rates up to 96kHz. It utilizes a high-quality, gold-sputtered electret condenser capsule that ensures exceptional transient and frequency response (20 Hz – 20 kHz, -3 dB) along with enhanced durability, and the integrated low-noise preamp lets you dial in just the right amount of gain for the optimum signal level. Able to withstand a maximum sound pressure of 125dB, iRig Mic HD 2 will stand up to recording even very loud sources and the cardioid pickup pattern will help reject unwanted sounds from back side of the microphone.  While using micro-USB for connectivity is likely a legacy holdover from the original, it feels dated. Unfortunately, the only other realistic option would have been USB-C, which needs a bit of time to mature before accessory makers accept it widely. As-is, connecting the iRig Mic HD 2 to an iPhone is a single-cable connection, and there’s no fussing with hardware. You just plug it in and go. You can choose the amount of gain, which is like saying you can choose how sensitive the mic will be. If you’re in a quiet environment and plan to do some voice-over work, more gain might be good. If you’re in an area with a bit of background noise, gain will pick that up. That said, iRig has done a good job of making sure more gain doesn’t equal picking up noise you didn’t hear. Some do, and it’s frustrating. The iRig Mic HD 2 is sitting on my desk a few feet from me, and picks up my voice just fine. The audio input can also be used to re-route to a recorder, mixer or PA system.  I’d like the iRig Mic HD 2 a lot more if it were wireless.

SAM McGinnisken needed a tough all-rounder for his cropping farm at Bungalally, in western Victoria, and picked up a New Holland T7.290 HD.  Sam says it has been a winner for its versatility across high and low horsepower jobs, and economy. The full story on the New Holland T7.290 HD appears in Crop Gear, where we also look at how precision farming has the potential to double crop yield and an Australian-designed film layer, which is boosting cotton crops. Plus there’s a round-up of 100hp tractors and a weighing up of direct heading versus windrowing canola. Crop Gear magazine is free in The Weekly Times this week.

 About a month has gone by since the last earnings report for JP Morgan Chase & Co JPM  . Shares have added about 1.6% in that time frame, outperforming the market. Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.  JPMorgan Q3 Earnings Beat Despite Trading Weakness  makeArticleAd();  Amid an expected trading slump, rising rates and loan growth drove JPMorgan third-quarter 2017 earnings of $1.76 per share, which easily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.67. Also, the figure reflects an 11% rise from the year-ago period. Notably, the results included a legal benefit of $107 million.    Solid loan growth (driven mainly by improved credit card loans) and higher interest rates supported net interest income. Further, rise in advisory fees supported top-line growth. A slight fall in operating expenses acted as a tailwind.    As expected, fixed income and equity trading slumped during the quarter. Likewise, underwriting fees (both equity and fixed income) witnessed a fall. Also, a decline in mortgage banking income, due to higher funding costs and fall in mortgage origination volume, was a headwind.    Apart from these, results were adversely impacted by an increase in provision for credit losses, mainly due to reserve build in Card portfolio.    The overall performance of JPMorgan's business segments, in terms of net income generation, was decent. All segments, except Corporate & Investment Bank, reported a rise in net income on a year-over-year basis.    Among other positives, both credit card sales volume and merchant processing volume grew 13%. Further, both Commercial Banking average loan balances and Asset Management average loan balances rose 10%.   Trading Slump Offset by Higher Rates & Loan Growth, Costs Down    Managed net revenues of $26.2 billion in the quarter were up 3% from the year-ago quarter. Also, it compared favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $25.7 billion. Rising rates and loan growth were the primary reasons for the top-line improvement. These were partially offset by lower trading revenues, investment banking fees and mortgage banking fees.    Non-interest expenses (on managed basis) were $14.3 billion, down 1% from the year-ago quarter. The fall was primarily driven by lower marketing costs and stable compensation expenses, partially offset by technology, communications and equipment costs.   Credit Quality Worsens    Provision for credit losses increased 14% year over year to $1.5 billion, primarily due to reserve build in Consumer loan portfolio. Also, net charge-offs were up 13% year over year to $1.3 billion.    However, as of Sep 30, 2017, non-performing assets were $6.2 billion, down 21% from the year-ago period.   Strong Capital Position    Tier 1 capital ratio (estimated) was 14.3% as of Sep 30, 2017 compared with 13.6% as of Sep 30, 2016. Tier 1 common equity capital ratio (estimated) was 12.6% as of Sep 30, 2017, up from 12.0% as of Sep 30, 2016. Total capital ratio came in at 16.1% (estimated) as of Sep 30, 2017 compared with 15.1% as of Sep 30, 2016.    Book value per share was $66.95 as of Sep 30, 2017 compared with $63.79 as of Sep 30, 2016. Tangible book value per common share came in at $54.03 as of Sep 30, 2017 compared with $51.23 as of Sep 30, 2016.   Outlook    For 2017, the company projects NII to increase about $4 billion. Management expects margin expansion to continue over the next several quarters driven by higher rates and deposit re-pricing.    Expect card, commerce solutions and auto division, CCB segment revenue in the fourth quarter 2017 is expected to be relatively flat sequentially as higher net interest income will be offset by the anniversary net impact of Sapphire reserve.    With no change expected in the overall volatility in the fourth quarter, Markets revenues are projected to decline year over year.    Management expects investment banking (IB) fees in the second half of 2017 to be down y/y, as the company had the highest IB fees on record in third quarter 2016. Nonetheless, overall sentiment remains positive with the company expecting equity issuance to continue (given the stable market backdrop) and the M&A backlog to be healthy with conditions remaining beneficial for refinancing activities.    For 2017, management expects adjusted expenses to be nearly $58 billion.    The company expects expenses in CB segment to remain relatively stable on a sequential basis.    Management projects average core loan growth to be around 8% in 2017 that will be funded from strong deposit balance.    For 2017, JPMorgan expects NCOs rate to be relatively flat across all businesses except Cards (up due to continued loan growth and the seasoning of newer vintages) and CIB (down on absence of energy related NCOs). Notably, NCOs are projected to be around $5 billion (excluding NCOs related to the student loan portfolio write-down in the first quarter 2017), driven by loan growth.    Management expects credit card charge-offs to be slightly below 3% for 2017 and in the higher end of 3-3.25% in 2018.    Consumer allowance for credit losses will likely increase $300 million in 2017, owing to growth across businesses, partly offset by allowance releases for the residential real estate portfolio. Further, wholesale allowance for credit losses (excluding energy and metals & mining portfolios) is expected to rise modestly. Management expects potential reserve releases in energy portfolio in the upcoming quarters, reflecting stabilizing  oil prices  .  How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?  It turns out, fresh estimates flatlined during the past month. There has been one revision higher for the current quarter compared to one lower.

Photographer: Michael Nagle/Bloomberg It took Jennifer Sharkey more than eight years to get a trial over her dismissal from JPMorgan Chase & Co. A Manhattan jury needed only five hours to find the former wealth manager was fired illegally and award her $1.13 million in damages. Then, it took just an hour for a Manhattan judge to upend the verdict and send the whole case back to square one. A jury of five women and three men found that the bank retaliated by firing Sharkey after she recommended the dumping of a client whom she suspected of fraud and money laundering. The panel rejected the bank’s claim that Sharkey was dismissed because she lied to her boss on multiple occasions. Sharkey was awarded $563,000 in back pay and $563,000 for emotional damage. That was before lunch on Tuesday. A little more than an hour later, U.S. District Judge Denise Cote said she’ll likely order a new trial if the two sides don’t hammer out a settlement because the verdict is "substantially flawed." "The award of emotional damages says to me that the jury was prejudiced against the bank," Cote said after JPMorgan Chase asked her to throw out the jury verdict. "That undermines the entire verdict." Both sides declined to comment after the hearing. Sharkey claimed she was let go in 2009 after telling her superiors she planned to recommend that JPMorgan Chase end its relationship with a client who had about $14 million at the bank. She testified she was worried the diamond seller who had also founded a phone calling-card business might have been involved in fraud and money laundering. “I was fired the next day,” Sharkey testified in Manhattan federal court. The case marked a rare trial of Sarbanes-Oxley whistle-blower claims in a dispute that got its start in the months following the discovery that Bernard Madoff used JPMorgan Chase bank accounts in his Ponzi scheme. Because of a pretrial ruling by the judge, Sharkey wasn’t allowed to testify about client-screening procedures at JPMorgan Chase in the wake of the Madoff fraud. "Of course I’m very happy -- 8 1/2 years," Sharkey said before the jury’s verdict was thrown into question by the judge. Sharkey got her day -- a week, actually -- in court after years of delays, including two appeals that reinstated her claims. A judge who said at a pretrial hearing that he’d “do anything to get rid of this case” withdrew from the case and was replaced with Cote. Jurors were forced to contend with an alphabet soup of letters that stood in for the names of people and companies. The client who raised Sharkey’s suspicions, for example, was referred to as Client A to protect his identity. Other characters in the story were given the names Client H, Manager T and Client BW. Sharkey’s former boss, Leslie Lassiter, testified that she lied numerous times when asked if she’d contacted the office of another client and that was the reason for her firing. The client’s office manager called to complain that Sharkey hadn’t returned calls and asked whether the wealth manager was just “a phantom," according to Lassiter. The trial quickly turned into a personal battle between Sharkey’s story and Lassiter’s. Each side accused the other’s star witness of lying. Two JPMorgan Chase executives, Joe Kenney and Adam Green, were found by the jury not liable, conclusions the judge said she would leave intact. Cote said she believed the fact the jury awarded the same amount in emotional damages as in back pay meant they were in fact trying to award punitive damages, against her instructions. She said she believed the evidence showed that Sharkey was fired for lying and that a rational jury couldn’t have found that she reasonably believed the diamond broker violated any laws, such as money laundering or fraud, spelled out in the Sarbanes-Oxley protections. "It’s with sadness that I make these findings because I know you have all been engaged in a very long journey here," Cote said. The bank’s legal team reacted with hugs and backslaps. The case is Sharkey v. JPMorgan Chase & Co., 10-cv-03824, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

JPMorgan Chase & Co. urged a judge to throw out a stunning $8 billion jury     verdict  over a mismanaged inheritance, saying the family deserves nothing. “The law and evidence do not support any claim against JPMorgan, much less the unprecedented multi-billion-dollar punitive damage award, which the heirs have already admitted is unconstitutionally excessive,” the bank said in a filing in Dallas probate court. Two children of     Max Hopper, a former     American Airlines executive who died in 2010, have already asked that the damages for them and their father’s estate be reduced to about     $74 million , while his widow has yet to weigh in with any adjustment to the ninth-largest verdict in U.S. history. More from Bloomberg.com: Everything You Need to Know About the Senate GOP Tax Plan JPMorgan said the jury “accepted to the penny, the extraordinary invitation” of the family’s legal team to award the $8 billion without doing any ”independent analysis,” according to Thursday’s filing. The bank previously said it was “highly confident” the verdict wouldn’t stand under Texas law. Hopper, who    pioneered a reservation system for the airline, died unexpectedly with assets of more than $19 million but without a will, according to court records. JPMorgan was hired to administer the estate and the bank should have divided the assets and released them to Jo Hopper and her stepchildren, according to the lawsuit. Instead, her lawyers said in a statement, “the bank took years to release basic interests in art, home furnishings, jewelry, and notably, Mr. Hopper’s collection of 6,700 golf putters and 900 bottles of wine. Some of the interests in the assets were not released for more than five years.’’ More from Bloomberg.com: China Gave Trump a Win on Trade and He Didn’t Even Know It The plaintiffs alleged that bank representatives failed to meet financial deadlines for assets under their control, stock options were allowed to expire, and Mrs. Hopper’s wishes to sell stock were ignored. The step children, Stephen Hopper and Laura Wassmer, also claimed that the bank cut them out of decisions and kept them uninformed in order to curry favor with their stepmother. Jo Hopper initially sued the bank, alleging breach of fiduciary duty. JPMorgan paid legal fees to defend this out of the estate account, depleting it by more than $3 million, the plaintiffs’ said in court filings. More from Bloomberg.com: Elon Musk’s Most-Liked Instagram Post Touches a Nerve in Turkey In September, a probate court jury awarded punitive damage awards of $2 billion each to Jo Hopper, the Hopper estate, Stephen Hopper and Laura Wassmer. JPMorgan denied any wrongdoing, saying it acted in good faith on the Hopper estate. “The crux of the lawsuit is whether sparring survivors of a decedent may blame an independent administrator for seeking judicial guidance on a distribution issue about which the survivors disagree,” the bank said in Thursday’s filing.

JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) has asked a judge to throw out an $8B jury verdict over a mismanaged inheritance, and says it's confident that the verdict won't hold up under Texas law. It's the ninth-biggest verdict in U.S. history. The family in the case deserves nothing, the firm said: “The law and evidence do not support any claim against JPMorgan, much less the unprecedented multi-billion-dollar punitive damage award, which the heirs have already admitted is unconstitutionally excessive.” Even some heirs -- two children of a former American Airlines exec who died in 2010 without a will -- have asked for damages to be reduced to around $74M, though the exec's widow hasn't weighed in yet. The bank was charged with taking several years to release even basic interests in the exec's estate. JPMorgan responds that it was acting in good faith. Now read: Best Financial Stocks: JPMorgan »

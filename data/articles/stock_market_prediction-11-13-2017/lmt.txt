					Posted by David Steele on Nov 13th, 2017 // No Comments  Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) was upgraded by Zacks Investment Research from a “sell” rating to a “hold” rating in a note issued to investors on Wednesday, October 25th.  According to Zacks, “Lockheed Martin's third-quarter 2017 earnings as well as revenues missed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, year-over-year results were impressive. Being the largest defense contractor in the world, Lockheed Martin witnesses strong demand for its high-end military equipments in both domestic as well as overseas markets. The latest $3.8 billion deal signed with the Bahrain government is expected to strongly boost its growth. However, the F-35 program, despite being a prime defense project for the U.S. government, has been facing criticism for being overtly expensive, for past few years. Moreover, the company's limited commercial exposure and almost full government dependency may prove fatal in maintaining its margins and bottom line. The company underperformed the broader industry over a year.” Several other research firms have also recently commented on LMT. BidaskClub cut Lockheed Martin Corporation from a “buy” rating to a “hold” rating in a research note on Tuesday, June 27th.

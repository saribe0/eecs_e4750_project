TSLA – Tesla’s biggest bear issued some scathing commentary on the company, its stock, and its CEO last week. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has become America’s largest automaker by market cap despite failing to launch a single mass market vehicle. The electric car company has issued enormous amounts of debt lately to fund its operations, and has largely gotten away with its money-losing practices due to the investing public buying ito CEO Elon Musk’s grand vision for an autonomous driving future. Billionaire investor Ron Baron believes he can still generate 20 times his money on Tesla shares, but Gabe Hoffman of Candens Capital says such notions are “ridiculous.” CNBC has more commentary from Tesla’s biggest bear: “Tesla already has a $50 billion diluted market cap. To say that it is going to $1 trillion is unbelievable.” Hoffman said recently issued Tesla bonds are “trading in junk territory and will get downgraded to junk.” He also said that the Model 3 will be a “complete disaster” both in quality and safety, and that autonomous cars are at least 10 years away, based on what he reads from autonomous technology engineers. Hoffman said Musk is “full of it” on Tesla’s timeline for autonomous cars. “Elon Musk makes Donald Trump look like an angel,” Hoffman said. Hoffman has a vested interest in Tesla’s downfall. He holds TSLA’s largest short position, and thus stands to benefit greatly if the stock plunges. Tesla Inc shares closed at $302.99 on Friday, unchanged on the day. Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 41.79%, versus a 17.11% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period. TSLA currently has a StockNews.com POWR Rating of B (Buy), and is ranked #6 of 24 stocks in the Auto & Vehicle Manufacturers category.

TSLA – Bernstein analyst who test drove the Model 3 this week came away with a very tepid impression. The Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) Model 3 is arguably the most hyped car in Wall Street history, but its actual fit and finish doesn’t live up to people’s lofty expectations. That’s according to Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi, who came away unimpressed after a recent test drive. CNBC has more details on the negative view: “We had the opportunity to see and test drive the Model 3 at Tesla’s showroom in Red Hook Brooklyn, NY … Fit and finish on the two demo cars we saw – perhaps not surprisingly – was relatively poor,” Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi wrote in a note to clients Friday. “While we doubt that it would impact (or even be noticed by) most prospective buyers, we do worry that poor overall initial quality could undermine Tesla’s brand and potentially overwhelm its service network.” Sacconaghi found shortcomings with the car’s glass roof, body panel gaps, misaligned seams on the interior ceiling of the car, and rubber trim issues around windows. Tesla acknowledged the flaws but said the Model 3 was much further along at this point than the Model S or Model X were. Accordingly, the firm reiterated its market perform rating and $265 price target on Tesla shares. That target suggests a 12.5% downside to current levels.

Tesla’s earnings numbers were not welcome news for investors. Today, the company said it delivered 26,137 cars during the third quarter, but only 222 of those were Model 3s. That’s far below the 1,500 Tesla was hoping to have delivered by this time. Overall, the company posted a loss of $619 million on sales of $2.98 billion. Tesla shares dropped by as much as 5.4% on the news in after-hours trading, before recovering slightly. Overall, the company’s stock is up by about 50% for the year. Tesla CEO Elon Musk had warned there would be bumps in the road as Tesla entered “production hell” for the Model 3, and in August warned of “production bottlenecks.” In a Nov. 1 letter to investors (pdf), Tesla clarified that the primary production constraint is the battery module assembly line in its Gigafactory 1 outside Reno, Nevada. Tesla said it was redesigning two parts of the battery assembly process, “key elements of which were done by manufacturing systems suppliers,” to streamline its automated manufacturing process. Musk says he’s camping out at the factory until the problems are resolved. In describing the struggle to get manufacturing back on track, he made an allusion to the nine circles of hell in Dante Alighieri’s Inferno. “We were in level nine, and we’re now in level eight and close to exiting level eight,” said Musk, “I thought we’d be more like level seven. I was really depressed three or four weeks ago.” Musk said that Tesla’s reliance on a small number of robotic stations to automate construction of the vehicle, rather than human workers, means that any problems on the line can slow assembly dramatically. The company’s fortunes are riding on the Model 3, which has a base price of $35,00. Tesla is betting its first mass-market car will elevate it to become the first automaker to join America’s famous “Big 3” in more than 50 years. Tesla has already surpassed all of them in market value at one time (GM put Tesla back in second place earlier this year), but the electric carmaker has yet to prove its staying power.  So far, it’s been a rough ride. Musk must coordinate a sprawling supply and production chain, including two factories where cars are assembled in Fremont and the Gigafactory where Model 3 battery packs and drive units are made. Tesla notes that its manufacturing process is more automated than most carmakers, and therefore takes longer to establish. The company said it plans to make 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week by about March 2018 (a quarter later than initially predicted) and then 10,000 units per week sometime after that. The company has about $3.5 billion in cash entering the fourth quarter to make it happen.

Tesla earnings (Shutterstock photo) Tesla (TSLA), which has ambitions of being more mainstream, will report third quarter fiscal 2017 earnings results after Wednesday's closing bell. But investors would feel much better if the luxury electric vehicle company had ambitions of being more profitable. Tesla shares have taken a massive beating over the past couple of weeks, falling as much as 18% from its all-time high of $386.99 reached in June to a recent low of $316.66 — the stock’s lowest level since early August. A combination of factors has impacted TSLA stock. But the biggest concern rests with Tesla’s money-making capabilities, particularly as it relates its highly-anticipated Model 3 sedan — the company’s first attempt at producing a mass market electric vehicle. Tesla reportedly spends some $80,000 to build each Model 3, which will retail for $35,000 — or about half the price of Tesla's next-cheapest car, the Model S. The company believes the lower price point would enable it to emerge from a niche market to better compete with Detroit heavyweights General Motors (GM) and Ford (F). On Wednesday the Street will want to get a sense of not only how realistic Tesla’s Model 3 delivery goals are, but also how much cash it will take to meet those goals. Earlier this month the company spooked investors when announcing that its third-quarter Model 3 delivery totals would be 220 vehicles. Though that marked a 4.5% increase year over year, it’s below the 1,260 vehicles analysts expected and well below the company’s year-end production targets of 20,000 Model 3s a month by December. On Friday analysts at Evercore downgraded TSLA stock from Buy to Neutral, advising their clients to be “more cautious” on Model 3 production. The Model 3 is “the most important piece of the Tesla investment story in coming quarters,” Evercore warned. In terms of overcoming production hiccups, which CEO Elon Musk recently described at “manufacturing hell,” Evercore noted, “We suspect that Tesla won’t have 100% visibility on the ramp until they hit more than 1,000 Model 3 units per week.” As such, the firm reduced its price target on TSLA stock to $312, from $330, implying a 3% downside to Friday’s closing price of $320.87. In the three months that ended September, Wall Street expects the Palo Alto, Calif.-based company to post a per-share loss of $2.29 on revenue of $2.94 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when the company lost 71 cents per share on $2.3 billion in revenue. For the full year, ending in December, the loss is expected to be $6.67 per share, compared to a loss of $2.87 a year ago, while full-year revenue of $11.84 billion would rise 69.2% year over year. All told, with the 1,000 Model 3 units per week benchmark expected to be reached toward the end of November, Tesla has a lot to prove Wednesday if it wants to keep its shares from driving in reverse. From my vantage point, however, these shares, which I now own, are not as risky as they were three months ago. I’ve said this before, Tesla’s main problem — if you can call it that — is that the company must overcome too much demand for its products. And that’s a business I want a piece of.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) unveiled its quarterly results Wednesday, posting a loss that was wider than any previous quarter in the company’s history. The company has been having trouble keeping up with the demand for its electric vehicles, prompting it to cut production of two vehicles. One such car is the Model X and the other is the Model S. All in all, Tesla will reduce the production of these cars by 10% in the fourth quarter in order to reallocate these resources into improving its Model 3. For the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the company plans on producing 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week. As far as the company’s earnings are concerned, Tesla posted an adjusted loss per share of $2.92 per share, significantly wider than the loss of $2.23 per share that Wall Street predicted. Revenue was a stronger point for the automotive company, coming in at $2.98 billion, ahead of the $2.39 billion that analysts called for. Tesla’s free cash flow fell to -$1.4 billion versus the -$1.2 billion projected by analysts. “While we continue to make significant progress each week in fixing Model 3 bottlenecks, the nature of manufacturing challenges during a ramp such as this makes it difficult to predict exactly how long it will take for all bottlenecks to be cleared or when new ones will appear,” Tesla said in a statement. TSLA shares fell 3.8% after the bell Wednesday. Article printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2017/11/tesla-inc-tsla-2/. ©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC

  It’s a well known fact that Elon Musk is against hydrogen fuel-cell technology. In fact, in numerous occasions the head of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has called the concept of hydrogen-powered cars a silly move, claiming that as a form of gas, hydrogen it’s not a source of energy but rather an energy storage mechanism. Musk believes that when it comes to battery electric vehicle space, the tech is simply inefficient and nothing more than a marketing ploy for automakers. “Fuel cells should be renamed ‘fool cells,’ they are so stupid,” Musk once said. So imagine what his reaction must have been after the announcement of Stefan Holthausen, the founder of Dutch gas supplier Holthausen Group, that a Tesla car had been converted to a hydrogen fuel cell powertrain. “We managed to hack a second-hand Tesla so that it can drive on hydrogen. With this we can more than double the action range,” said Holthausen, adding “[t]he hydrogen-powered Tesla Model S was dubbed the “Hesla.” Holthausen’s Hesla success makes his company the first in the world to do so. The way they approached their conversion project was by initially having the Group’s engineers neither touch nor replace Model S’ built-in battery. What they did next was add a second layer of charging connected to a hydrogen power source. Inside the fuel cell, electrons stripped from hydrogen gas were then passed through a circuit into the original battery to give the additional charge. Once the polarized hydrogen atoms react with oxygen to make water, they exit the fuel cell.

Inserting a hydrogen tank and fuel cell into the car’s system though was not an easy feat. Engineer Max Holthausen called Tesla’s model S engineering system “a big maze.” But despite the challenges in the end, they managed to successfully complete their Hesla Project, claiming that the modification had boosted the mileage of the electric vehicle (EV) to 1,000 km (620 miles) on a full battery charge and hydrogen supply. This is almost double the best range seen in the Tesla Model S line—the 100D version officially runs only up to 539 km (335 miles) on a single charge. Like Tesla’s cars, vehicles equipped with hydrogen fuel cells also run on electricity. The main difference is that the former store electricity in a battery while the latter generate their electricity with hydrogen and oxygen. It should be noted that the one advantage fuel cell vehicles have over EVs is that their refueling takes only a few minutes while charging electric cars takes longer. Ideally, if one could take only the best features these systems offer and efficiently combine them into one model, then we’d obviously be able to create a much better car range-wise. That said, US Tesla S owners before considering a hydrogen fuel cell conversion should know that Holthausen’s package costs $58,000. At the same time, a brand new Tesla S costs around $80,000. Holthausen claims however, that there’s already interest in the product, saying the company has “already received a lot of requests from home and abroad.” Another aspect to consider is that there are very few hydrogen refueling stations—only 39 in the US, with 25 of them concentrated on the West Coast. When one compares that number with 16,000 public charging stations for electric cars, running on rechargeable batteries alone is still a much more convenient and far cheaper option. There are two schools of thought about this new development. Critics say inserting a hydrogen tank defeats an electric car’s purpose of not relying on an external power source. Still, advocates welcome this idea as a mileage extender given the new approach will be less worrisome for electric car owners in terms of thinking when the nearest sign of a charging station will appear. Despite the setbacks from high conversion costs and scarcity of stations, Holthausen, who is also involved with hydrogen stations, sees a niche for hydrogen alongside pure battery-powered systems. He intends to improve his prototype and collect further data as the need for nonpetroleum power sources keeps on growing. Should things advance adaptability and efficiency-wise, the conversion could create an additional market for hydrogen-refueling infrastructure and hydrogen fuel cells, something Toyota and several other automakers, including GM and Honda, would love to see happening as they push for the commercialization of fuel-cells as a zero emission technology. Additionally, according to a Global Market for Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles report, fuel cells could sell more than 20 million vehicles by year 2032, generating up to $1.2 trillion in revenue for the auto industry.

https://investorplace.com/2017/10/tsla-stock-shock-somebody/

In June, I discussed the reasons why I thought Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) could hit $1,000. At the time, TSLA stock was trading around $360. Since then it’s taken a small step backward.  I gave what I thought was an honest analysis of what has to go right for TSLA to hit one million vehicles produced annually by 2020; should the company do that, hitting $1,000 is anything but impossible—but it has to get to a million.  Nearing the end of October, Tesla’s got 38 months to hit that production number. To hit $1,000, TSLA stock has to grow at 43% compounded annually over the next three years; a 48% return in 2018 would get it to $500. A 48% decline would drag it down to $176, but I’ve rounded it up to $200 for simplicity’s sake. Which does TSLA stock hit in 2018? $200 or $500? The heavy hitter wrote a very unflattering letter to clients Oct. 24 about Tesla. Of course, what’s Einhorn going to say when he’s got a significant short position in the company’s stock. In August I acknowledged Einhorn’s short, concluding my article by suggesting that Tesla’s stock would be overvalued if it doesn’t hit monthly production of 20,000 Model 3s by the end of the year. “The Wall Street Journal reported that the much-hyped Model 3 was indeed in production — by hand,” wrote InvestorPlace’s Lawrence Meyers discussing Tesla’s instance valuation recently. “Another source even says that the Model 3 is still being developed. Wasn’t this the car Musk said would be delivered in 2016?” That doesn’t sound like a company ready to produce 20,000 vehicles per anytime soon, does it? Einhorn certainly doesn’t think so. “Given the performance of certain stocks, we wonder if the market has adopted an alternative paradigm for calculating equity value,” wrote Einhorn in his letter to clients. “What if equity value has nothing to do with current or future profits and instead is derived from a company’s ability to be disruptive…?” That describes Tesla to a tee.  Unfortunately, David, the value placed on any stock is merely a number both the buyer and seller can agree to. One man’s gold is another man’s garbage; Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, yadda, yadda, yadda.    Bottom line: Einhorn might be right that TSLA stock isn’t worth the paper it’s written on but until a majority of investors come to this conclusion, TSLA will continue to trend higher.

Ahead of  Tesla Inc  (NASDAQ: TSLA)'s  third-quarter results,  Baird analyst Ben Kallo said he'd buy the shares on any weakness. Though cautious into the quarter, Baird remains a long-term buyer, Kallo said in a Wednesday note.  Tesla is scheduled to release its results after the market close Wednesday, Nov. 1.  The firm maintained its Outperform rating and $411 price target for Tesla.  At the time of writing, shares of Tesla were slipping 3.29 percent to $326.24. Baird Lowers Estimates Baird lowered its estimates for Tesla to reflect lower absorption from the  Model 3,  which Kallo said will impact margins, and potentially lower ASPs on the Model S and Model X vehicles.  The firm projects Tesla's third-quarter revenues at $2.879 billion; gross margin of 16.3 percent; and a loss per share of $2.78. This represents a scale down from Kallo's earlier expectations for revenues of $3.058 billion, a gross margin of 18.4 percent and a loss per share of $2.21. Despite the Model 3 ramp being one to two months behind schedule, Tesla will successfully ramp production and meet intermediate production targets, Kallo said. If production challenges continue through April 2018, the production ramp will become a larger issue, given the potential need for  additional capital, Kallo said.  Tesla's upcoming semi-truck unveiling Nov. 14, should serve as a positive catalyst, Kallo said. The continued ramp of the Model 3 and progress toward becoming cash flow positive are Tesla's two largest catalysts, the analyst said. Here's Baird's take on the biggest catalysts for Tesla stock:  Related Links:  The Model 3, Cash Burn And Autonomous Tech: What To Listen For On Tesla's Q3 Call  Tesla Reportedly Close To Operating Its Own Manufacturing Facility In China Photo courtesy of Tesla.

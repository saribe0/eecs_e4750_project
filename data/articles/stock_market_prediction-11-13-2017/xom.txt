http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/peak-oil-majors-arent-buying-into-the-threat-from-renewables-2432679.html

Two decades ago, BP set out to transcend oil, adopting a sunburst logo to convey its plans to pour USD 8 billion over a decade into renewable technologies, even promising to power its gas stations with the sun. That transformation - marketed as "Beyond Petroleum" - led to manufacturing solar panels in Australia, Spain and the United States and erecting wind farms in the United States and the Netherlands. Today, BP might be more aptly branded "Back to Petroleum" after exiting or scaling back its renewable energy investments. Lower-cost Chinese components upended its solar panel business, which the firm shed in 2011. A year later, BP tried to sell its US wind power business but couldn't get a buyer. "We made very big bets in the past," BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley told Reuters in an interview. "A lot of those didn't work. We're not sure yet what will be commercially acceptable." The costly lesson of the biggest foray yet by an oil major into renewable energy was not lost on rival firms. Even as governments and environmentalists forecast a peak in oil demand within a generation - and China and India say they may eventually ban gasoline and diesel vehicles - leaders of the world's biggest oil firms are not buying the argument that their traditional business faces any imminent threat. A Reuters analysis of clean energy investments and forecasts by oil majors, along with exclusive interviews with top oil executives, reveal mostly token investments in alternative energy. Today, renewable power projects get about 3 percent of USD 100 billion in combined annual spending by the five biggest oil firms, according to energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie. BP, Chevron, Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell and Total are instead milking their drilling and processing assets to finance investor payouts now and bolster balance sheets for the future. They believe they can enter new energy sectors later by acquiring companies or technologies if and when others prove them profitable. "There is no sign of peak demand right now," said Chevron CEO John Watson, an economist by training, who is retiring in early 2018. "For the next 10 or 20 years, we expect to see oil demand growth." For a graphic showing BP's fossil fuel and renewable energy forecasts, see: http://tmsnrt.rs/2h4vGHd The International Energy Agency forecasts a 10 percent rise in oil demand through 2040, reflecting the consensus among oil firms. The earliest estimate for peak oil demand from any oil company is late next decade, by Shell CEO Ben van Beurden. History shows energy transitions - from wood to coal to oil - take a long time. Coal's contribution to world energy consumption peaked recently at 28 percent and remains above the share from natural gas, though just below oil's one-third. Profit, if any, from the majors' decades-long interest in renewable energy ventures is unclear. None of the largest oil companies disclose earnings from their solar, wind or biofuels ventures. Investors such as Alasdair McKinnon, portfolio manager at Scottish Investment Trust, believe oil will sustain shareholders far into the future. "There isn't a viable alternative to fossil fuels on the horizon," he said. "We're not buying into the long-term demand destruction for oil." The confidence in oil's future relies largely on rising consumption from emerging economies. Exxon forecasts that transportation will require 25 percent more fuel by 2040, propelled by growth in Asia. Chevron's analysis of the India and Nigeria markets, meanwhile, concludes that infrastructure needed for electric cars is unlikely to be built. Cars account for about a fifth of oil consumption, BP estimates. So if electric vehicles do eventually capture mass markets, oil firms would still expect growing demand from the air, rail and trucking industries. Natural gas - now a smaller business than oil for most majors - can grow to nearly a quarter of all energy used by displacing coal in power generation and through expanded uses in chemicals, these companies forecast. Natural gas can also fuel the power needed for electric cars. Although Shell forecasts peak oil demand coming earlier than its rivals, it is preparing for that prospect mostly with massive natural gas investments. The firm last year spent $54 billion acquiring BG Group, which derives half its production from gas. Chevron, Exxon and Shell recently have spent billions of dollars on new liquefied natural gas projects across the globe. Exxon declined to comment for this article. SHORT-SIGHTED STRATEGY? Critics of oil majors' cautious renewable strategy - including some big investors - say the firms are being short-sighted in their trust that change will come slow, or that one fossil fuel will gradually replace another. Just as cheap natural gas is supplanting coal, even cheaper wind or solar eventually will displace gas, they argue. South Australia is soon to become a proving ground for a project could pave the way for renewable power to supplant fossil fuels for peak electricity - a combined wind farm and grid-scale battery storage facility, by electric-car maker Tesla Inc and operator Windlab Ltd. Fossil fuel companies need to quickly reorient themselves to the low returns of the solar and wind industries, said Jules Kortenhorst, a former Shell executive who runs the Rocky Mountain Institute, a nonprofit energy research organization. "You cannot flip a switch on a Monday morning from being one to another," he said. "Paychecks in the oil and gas industry are based on fundamentally believing that the world cannot see economic growth without fossil fuels." To achieve the same share of the renewables market that the largest publicly-traded oil companies now hold in oil and gas would require an investment of about USD 350 billion over the next 18 years, estimates consultancy Wood Mackenzie. Such spending would cut into the generous dividends that oil firms' shareholders have come to expect. "We think it will be a real challenge for these companies to change their business model," said Nathan Fabian, director of policy at Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), a United Nations-backed group. PRI has guidelines calling for investment analysis that weighs environmental, social and governance issues. Its principles have been adopted by investors with $70 trillion in assets under management. SMALL SCALE RENEWABLES INVESTMENTS Oil companies have made relatively modest investments a wide range of renewable technologies. Chevron has a smattering of mostly small wind and solar ventures; Shell invests in sugar-cane ethanol in South America, wind farms in the United States and electric-car charging stations in Europe; and BP still owns the US wind farms it once tried to sell. John Browne - who as BP's CEO two decades ago helped launch the early investments in renewables - said he still believes the renewable power will grow. "It will take time," he said in an interview with Reuters last month. "And they have time." Shell pledged to invest up to USD 1 billion a year by 2020 in what it calls "new energies." Total said this year it would spend USD 500 million annually on developing alternatives. But soon after that announcement, it unveiled its USD 7.5 billion acquisition of Maersk Oil, part of a plan to pump more crude from Norway's North Sea. Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne in October explained the focus on economics at an October oil conference in London. "When you ask our customers what their priority is, either in developed economies or in emerging countries, price comes first," he said. A hasty shift to renewables, he said, "could bring great economic and social damage to our 6 billion customers." Exxon Mobil is backing research into biofuels, joining with gene modification firm Synthetic Genomics to coax algae to produce more lipids, an oil substitute. It hasn't detailed its investment but said the effort remains far from commercialization. By comparison, Exxon this year spent USD 5.6 billion on US shale oil assets. BATTERY-POWERED CARS, PLANES Some of the oil industry's largest customers are planning a shift to renewable alternatives, especially in transportation, which accounts for about a quarter of annual energy consumption. Ford Motor Co earlier this fall disclosed it would aim, by 2030, to derive a third of its sales from battery-powered cars and another third from gas-electric hybrids. A startup backed by Boeing Co and JetBlue Airways Corp recently announced plans for a small hybrid jet by 2022, using batteries from Tesla and battery supplier Panasonic Corp. Yet oil firms continue to forecast aggressive growth in liquid fuels. Exxon predicts 90 percent of the transportation industry will rely on petroleum through 2040. BP projects the world's auto fleet doubling to 1.8 billion vehicles by 2035, with only 75 million of those powered by electricity.

Shares of Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) observed rebound of 9.06% since bottoming out on Aug. 31, 2017. Meanwhile, due to an ongoing pressure which caused a decline of almost -0.29% in the past five days, the stock price is now down -8.11% so far on the year — still in weak territory. In this case, shares are down -11.02% , the 52-week high touched on Dec. 13, 2016, but are collecting gains at -4.72% for the past 12 months.  Brokerage houses, on average, are recommending investors to hold Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM)’s shares projecting a $84 target price. Analysts‟ target price forecasts are a prediction of a stock‟s future price, generally over the 12 months following the release date (Asquith et al., 2005). This forecast is a point estimate that provides investors with a benchmark against which to directly compare stock price in the short run.Target prices made by analysts employed by large brokers, who have access to a greater resource pool, are more likely to be met over the 12-month forecast period.  XOM’s revenue has declined at an average annualized rate of about -14.1% during the past five years. However, the company’s most recent quarter increase of 13.5% looks attractive. The sales growth rate for a stock is a measure of how the stock’s sales per share (SPS) has grown over a specific period of time. It tells an investor how quickly a company is increasing its revenues. The sales growth rate helps investors determine how strong the overall growth-orientation is for a stock or portfolio.   The best measure of a company is its profitability, for without it, it cannot grow, and if it doesn’t grow, then its stock will trend downward. Increasing profits are the best indication that a company can pay dividends and that the share price will trend upward. Creditors will loan money at a cheaper rate to a profitable company than to an unprofitable one; consequently, profitable companies can use leverage to increase stockholders’ equity even more. Profitability ratios compare different accounts to see how efficiently a business is generating profits. These ratios show how well income is generated through operations, and are important to both creditors and investors. They help determine the company’s ability to continue operating. Currently, Exxon Mobil Corporation net profit margin for the 12 months is at 5.5%. Comparatively, the peers have a net margin 6.06%, and the sector’s average is 99.13%. In that light, it seems in weak position compared to its peers and sector. The profit margin measures the amount of net income earned with each dollar’s worth of revenue. It shows the percentage of sales that remain after all of the company’s expenses have been paid. The higher the ratio, the better.  Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM) is another stock that is grabbing investors attention these days. Its shares have trimmed -7.62% since hitting a peak level on Oct. 27, 2017. Thanks to an increase of almost 1.22% in the past one month, the stock price is now outperforming with 19.78% so far on the year — still in strong zone. In this case, shares are 31.22% higher, the worst price in 52 weeks suffered on Jan. 23, 2017, and are keeping their losses at 5.75% for the past six months.  The good news is there’s still room for Humana Inc. (HUM) to grow. At recent closing price of $244.39, HUM has a chance to add $21.55 or 8.82% in 52 weeks, based on mean target price ($265.94) placed by analysts.The analyst consensus opinion of 2 looks like a hold. It has a 36-month beta of 0.87 , so you might not be in for a bumpy ride.  For the past 5 years, Humana Inc.’s EPS growth has been nearly -13.6%. Sure, the percentage is discouraging but better times are ahead as looking out over a next 5-year period, analysts expect the company to see its earnings go up by 11.87%, annually.  Humana Inc. (HUM)’s ROE is 16.56%, while industry’s is 16.11%. The average ROE for the sector stands at 15.56%. The return on equity (ROE), also known as return on investment (ROI), is the best measure of the return, since it is the product of the operating performance, asset turnover, and debt-equity management of the firm. If a firm can borrow money and use it to achieve a higher return than the cost of the debt, then the leveraging creates additional revenue that accrues to stockholders as increased equity.  Humana Inc.’s ROA is 5.97%, while industry’s average is 5.15%. As with any return, the higher this number the better. However, it, too, needs to be taken into the context of a company’s peer group as well as its sector. The average return on assets for companies in the same sector is 11.09. The return on assets (ROA) (aka return on total assets, return on average assets), is one of the most widely used profitability ratios because it is related to both profit margin and asset turnover, and shows the rate of return for both creditors and investors of the company. ROA shows how well a company controls its costs and utilizes its resources.

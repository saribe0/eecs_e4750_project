It has a clientele base who are absolute fanatics about its products and they don’t mind over paying for it. I do have bones to pick. First is with the current leader.

It does have a lot of cash, but just because rates are low doesn’t mean I should burden myself with debt. Especially when I am not putting it towards generating new growth. When Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) issues debt, it’s because it needs to enter new markets. The company just did it to buy Whole Foods. By now, you might be upset because I’m not worshiping at the Tim Cook altar, but this is nothing against AAPL stock. It is an awesome company and it has a rosy future. Therein lies my opportunity to go long today, even if it is near its all-time high. Being as high as ever is not the same as saying it’s expensive. From a valuation perspective, AAPL stock has a price-to-earnings ratio one third smaller than Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and half that of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). So there is no doubt that I am investing in value today. Technically, the story is a little different. Investors are uneasy at risking $175-per-share to buy a stock when it’s at an all time high. It is natural to think that there could be slightly better entry points in the near future.

After staying quite for a long time Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares have recently been behaving interestingly to keep investors awake. Analysts often use price and volume data to predict future stock performance. In the case of AAPL, the chart has some interesting things to say about where the stock might be headed. How has the stock performed recently? Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the last month has increased +11.26%. Shares are now up over the past year, outperforming the broad market by -100% and outperformed a peer group of similar companies by 290%. After the latest session, which saw the stock close at a price of $174.67, AAPL sits below its 52-week high. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been trading in a bullish manner, based on the relative positions of the stock’s 20 and 200 day moving averages. Momentum indicators 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that AAPL may be headed in the future. To do this, analysts often study the speed and magnitude of a stock’s price movements with what are known as momentum indicators. The logic is that as a stock’s momentum slows, it may be nearing key support or resistance levels and possibly the end of a current trend. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for AAPL is 69.78%, which suggests that the stock is not particularly expensive or cheap, and not predisposed to a reactive price movement based on this measure. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 96.97%, tells a different story, and suggests that AAPL currently trades in overbought territory. What do the trading volumes reveal? In addition to price, analysts use volume trends to predict future performance. The level of trading activity in a stock is often a good proxy for the level of interest and enthusiasm for the name within the investment community. A sudden increase in activity can be a sign that investors are trading in anticipation of a catalyst. Apple Inc. (AAPL) average trading volume of 30,102,650 during the past month is 10.09% above its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been more active than usual in the stock in recent times. What do the analysts think? AAPL is currently undervalued by -6.26% relative to the average 1-year price target of $186.34 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 1.80, which implies that analysts are generally bullish in their outlook for AAPL over the next year. How risky is the stock?  When analyzing a stock’s price performance, it’s essential to take risk into account. Beta, which measures a stock’s volatility relative to the overall market, can be used to gauge the level of systematic risk associated with a particular stock. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has a beta of 1.21, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are more extreme than the market as a whole. AAPL therefore has a above average level of market risk. During the past couple of weeks, AAPL average daily volatility was 19.42%, which is -0.57 percentage points higher than the average volatility over the past 100 days.

https://www.benzinga.com/media/cnbc/17/11/10764879/heres-why-apple-will-be-worth-1-trillion-by-the-end-of-2017

Many investors are saying it's merely a matter of when, not if, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) will exceed the $1 trillion valuation mark. TradingAnalysis.com's founder Todd Gordon. To take advantage of Apple's momentum, Gordon recommends buying the December monthly 180-strike call and sell the December 185-strike call for a maximum profit of $377. Apple's stock chart has been signaling "very strong" momentum dating back as far as summer 2016, Gordon said during a recent CNBC "Trading Nation" segment. Specifically, by drawing a parallel channel line on Apple's stock, the technical analysis would place Apple's stock within reach of $200 per share by the end of 2017, which would give it a valuation north of $1 trillion. Apple's stock escaped Thursday's volatile session almost unscathed as opposed to the major indices which saw notable losses, including a triple digit decline in the Dow Jones and a 0.6 percent decline in the Nasdaq composite index. "Apple's showing some pretty good relative strength in this pretty good pocket of volatility we're seeing here," he said. However, at $200 per share, the technical analysis tools used by Johnson also implies that Apple's stock would be overbought. Shares of Apple closed Friday at $174.67, which is within reach of its all-time high of $176.24.

https://investorplace.com/2017/11/apple-pushing-content-look-out-netflix/

We’ve all known that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) would eventually make a push into content. It already has, although admittedly, it’s been a toe-dip at best. AAPL stock is down slightly thanks to the broader market pullback Thursday. But let’s not overlook the new deal it just announced. A new drama series featuring Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston is in the works. While we don’t know the terms of the programming deal, costs could run in excess of $10 million per episode. For a company like Apple, that’s less than a drop in the bucket — this company generated $10.7 billion in net income last quarter alone. Reportedly, Apple beat out Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and CBS Corporation’s (NYSE:CBS) Showtime for the “highly sought after show.” We’ve seen a big shift in retail thanks to e-commerce, led by Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Well that very shift is happening in content consumption, too. It shows why AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) wants Time Warner Inc (NYSE:TWX) for its content and HBO assets. It shows why Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) may be trying to buy Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (NASDAQ:FOX). AT&T already owns DirecTV, which is feeling cord-cutting pressure. Disney wants to bulk up its content and studio offerings. After all, content is king. But my question has always been, what happens to these guys — and Netflix, which is spending as much as $8 billion on content next year — when Apple gets involved? What happens when Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) gets involved with its Watch platform? To an extent, we’ve seen it with Amazon, but there haven’t been any repercussions. But I ask about FB and AAPL simply because of their size. For example, if they wanted to control live sports content, they could. Movies, TV and originals, too. Maybe they’ll be content with just being the distribution platform — iPads, iPhones and Facebook’s Watch. But if its content they want, it could have big implications for content and distribution companies. I don’t know how long it will take to see this shift or even if it will ultimately happen. But in my eyes, Apple just took its first real step toward joining the content game. Should it get more involved, it will raise plenty of questions. It obviously has a huge ecosystem to leverage, be it mobile devices or at-home devices like Apple TV. With almost a billion iTunes users, it also has the customer preference and credit card data it needs. I think this is why Netflix is spending so much on content. It’s producing its own shows and movies because others with far deeper pockets are looming. Even if FB or AAPL don’t meaningfully get into the game, others like HBO and Disney are looking to their own solutions. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) also has a pretty solid $35/month offering for YouTubeTV. But it’s unclear if YouTubeTV is a threat or a complement to Netflix at this point. It is clear, though, that everyone is chasing Netflix right now.

Many investors are saying it's merely a matter of when, not if, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) will exceed the $1 trillion valuation mark. TradingAnalysis.com's founder Todd Gordon.

Getty  A week before Apple released the iPhone X, its most important new product launch in years, CEO Tim Cook flew hundred of miles away to the middle of the country.  He made the trip to attend the opening of a new "flagship" Apple store in Chicago.  The Chicago store showcased the new design Apple is rolling out across its network of retail outlets, a massive revamp that includes bigger spaces with sweeping balconies and leather seating balls, an upgraded title (retail stores are now "Apple's biggest product") and opening day fanfare reminiscent of an iPhone launch. The store makeovers are great fodder for press releases that tout "town squares" and space for community building. But the store redesigns also serve a more critical function, by providing a much-needed overhaul of Apple's customer support system, the Genius Bar — a signature feature of Apple's retail business that has struggled to keep up with the times. According to numerous blue-shirted "geniuses" that Business Insider spoke to, a rising tide of store visitors and on-the-job performance expectations have pushed the system to the breaking point.  "The customer service model is about ready to pop," says one Apple "genius" who has worked at the company for seven years and requested anonymity because employees are not permitted to talk to the press. "That is the issue and the employees are feeling it," the person says. Apple's effort to ease the strain on its stores and its tech support system is especially important as ecommerce is changing the face of retail in the United States. Because it's more convenient to order an iPhone from retailers online, Apple needs to lean on the other advantages physical stores offer more than at any time since it opened its retail stores, say analysts. "The thing you're really want to go after is the experience, that's the thing that's going to set you apart, because you can just buy a product online," says Above Avalon analyst Neil Cybart. "The changes reflect where retail is headed, it's not just selling a product, it's about going beyond the product."  AppleWhen Apple first opened its retail stores in 2001, the company was still a niche player with a less than 4% share of the US PC market. Today, Apple is the world's most valuable company, with a staggering $900 billion market cap, thanks in large part to the success of the iPhone. Apple makes over $5000 per square foot, according to an Emarketer estimate. That's higher than any other retailer, even luxury stores like Tiffany's, says Nicholas Pitsis, research analyst at Emarketer. That kind of efficiency — and the foot traffic that Apple draws — means that malls want to attract Apple as an "anchor," Pitsis said.   With all that success comes crowds. Apple now has over 85 million iPhone users in the United States, according to a recent estimate. That means more Apple users per store than ever before, and more people walking through the doors with everything from cracked phone screens to problems logging into iTunes.  Retail employees notice that the stores are packed. One says that his store can't keep up. "We haven’t been able to keep up with traffic since I started 8 years ago," a senior Genius at a small store in the Midwest that has yet to be redesigned told Business Insider. "I wouldn’t even walk in the store because of how crowded it gets. During Christmas [season] you can hardly move."   Even consumers who purchased their phones through their wireless carriers now increasingly turn to the Apple store as their de-facto service center. In some cases, the arrangement is deliberate: T-Mobile earlier this year started bundling AppleCare, Apple's warranty and service program, into its own device insurance program, funneling its own customers to Apple for service.  "The carriers have always kind of seen the support side as a cost they'd rather not carry at retail and done their best in last few years to shift support to online and phone channels, and get it out of stores," analyst Jan Dawson said. "I think Apple is very welcoming, they encourage you to come into their stores and ask for help, it's quite different in that sense from anything else that's out there."  Cramer's ShirtOne Genius who worked on the West Coast said that he felt the pressure to service an increasing number of customers, and received pressure from his supervisors to get people out of the store quickly, especially if he took more than the 10 minutes allotted for an iPhone appointment.  "It's turning into a reality that the system Apple has in place is not able to keep up with the volume of people and demand," he said.  Apple retail employees use a system called Net Promoter for People, or "NPP," and the number of customers an Apple employee helps per day is tracked."We're challenged on those metrics to get them in and out of fast as possible," he continued. The elimination of perks, like flying newly-hired Geniuses to Apple's Cupertino headquarters for training, has also lessened the job's allure. "For the past five years they've been trying to keep up with the 'victim of their own success' problem, switching now to larger stores to accommodate more techs. More Geniuses. That's been a trend that's very clear," Loup Ventures founder Gene Munster said.  In 2016, Apple introduced a new repair role, named Technical Expert, which can do iPhone repairs and replacements for customers, but can't repair Macs. The new Technical Expert roles seem to be doing a better job accommodating people who walk in with broken iPhones without appointments. AppleWith the new store design, Apple is rethinking the concept of the Genius Bar itself. Although new stores still have the traditional scheduled appointments for customers, the system has shifted to what Apple calls the "Genius Grove," in which roving techs can service customers in a large tree-lined part of the store.  "You see a lot of design changes, moving away from a Genius Bar, it really is basically the whole store, you just kind of walk in and you don't wait in one specific spot, you just talk to anybody," Cybart said. "The goal is kind of to answer your question, take your product from you, and have you move on and not have lines." If it works as intended, the process will be a win for both customers and Apple staffers. The redesigns are so important that Apple appears to have slowed its retail expansion in the US to focus on them. Apple's total number of retail stores in the US was flat at 270 stores in Apple's fiscal 2017 year, the first year without new stores in at least three years according to research firm eMarketer. (The new Chicago store opened in Apple's fiscal 2018).   And Apple is trying to make the most of its existing space, adding square footage to alleviate the overcrowding.  "They actually expand the literal footprint of their stores. And so they've been remodeling some of the smaller stores to make it almost twice as large. It's not necessary just to fit more product in, it's just to really have people move around," Cybart said.  The idea is to let customers do things in-store that aren't possible to do online, whether that's getting a technical problem solved or taking the free photography and programming classes Apple offers in its stores.  Apple's Cook said at the Chicago store opening that selling products is only a "small part" of what its spaces are for. Now it's up to the new retail spaces to prove it.  Email the author at kleswing@businessinsider.com  NOW WATCH: Unboxing the iPhone X: Here's everything inside and what you'll need to get See Also: SEE ALSO: How Apple decides to replace or repair your iPhone

Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA) has had an impressive run. BABA stock is up 112% so far this year, but I, like many analysts, don’t think the ride is over yet. As we draw closer to the beginning of 2018, it’s hard to imagine BABA stock price dropping. In fact, the firm looks poised to have a bumper 3rd quarter. There are many growth catalysts on the horizon for Alibaba, and that suggests that the firm’s share price will push above $200 within the next few months. Here’s a look at three reasons BABA stock has the potential to rise above $200 by the end of January: It’s impossible to mention Alibaba right now with out talking about Singles Day, a massive shopping holiday in China where people are encouraged to spend money on themselves. Think ‘Black Friday’ on steroids. Singles Day always takes place on November 11, and this year Alibaba did $25.3 billion in sales during the made-up holiday. To put that into perspective, Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) had its annual Prime Day sale and was estimated to have moved $1 billion worth of goods, and last year’s Black Friday weekend only totaled about $8 billion. If that doesn’t add some fire to BABA’s stock price, I’d be very surprised. Alibaba practically invented Singles Day and its massive success is a testament of BABA’s ability to influence Chinese consumers. It also is a sign that China’s middle class is ready to spend some if its disposable income, which is something I have questioned in the past. Perhaps the biggest reason to get excited about Singles Day is the second reason BABA stock is likely to climb in the months ahead- Ling Shou Tong, or “connect retail.” Alibaba founder Jack Ma has been looking to expand BABA’s reach through cloud computing and logistics businesses and Ling Shou Tong is his answer. Ahead of Singles Day, Alibaba made its way into about 600,000 convenience stores, or 10% of the total number of independent convenience stores in the country, by upgrading their computer systems and acting as a kind of inventory management system. BABA allows the stores to manage procurement and sales, but the company’s Ling Shou Tong app uses customer data to help the stores determine which goods to stock and how to display them. Alibaba then ships the goods itself to fill stores’ orders.

https://investorplace.com/2017/11/reasons-baba-stock-heading/

Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA) has had an impressive run. BABA stock is up 112% so far this year, but I, like many analysts, don’t think the ride is over yet. As we draw closer to the beginning of 2018, it’s hard to imagine BABA stock price dropping. In fact, the firm looks poised to have a bumper 3rd quarter. There are many growth catalysts on the horizon for Alibaba, and that suggests that the firm’s share price will push above $200 within the next few months. Here’s a look at three reasons BABA stock has the potential to rise above $200 by the end of January: It’s impossible to mention Alibaba right now with out talking about Singles Day, a massive shopping holiday in China where people are encouraged to spend money on themselves. Think ‘Black Friday’ on steroids. Singles Day always takes place on November 11, and this year Alibaba did $25.3 billion in sales during the made-up holiday. To put that into perspective, Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) had its annual Prime Day sale and was estimated to have moved $1 billion worth of goods, and last year’s Black Friday weekend only totaled about $8 billion. If that doesn’t add some fire to BABA’s stock price, I’d be very surprised. Alibaba practically invented Singles Day and its massive success is a testament of BABA’s ability to influence Chinese consumers. It also is a sign that China’s middle class is ready to spend some if its disposable income, which is something I have questioned in the past. Perhaps the biggest reason to get excited about Singles Day is the second reason BABA stock is likely to climb in the months ahead- Ling Shou Tong, or “connect retail.” Alibaba founder Jack Ma has been looking to expand BABA’s reach through cloud computing and logistics businesses and Ling Shou Tong is his answer. Ahead of Singles Day, Alibaba made its way into about 600,000 convenience stores, or 10% of the total number of independent convenience stores in the country, by upgrading their computer systems and acting as a kind of inventory management system. BABA allows the stores to manage procurement and sales, but the company’s Ling Shou Tong app uses customer data to help the stores determine which goods to stock and how to display them. Alibaba then ships the goods itself to fill stores’ orders.

 AMZN JD BABA QCOM GE AVGO  Monday, November 13, 2017Early news to start the week ahead of today’s opening bell begins with a dividend cut to one of the U.S.'s biggest companies: General Electric (GE  -  Free Report)	 has announced it is slashing its dividend in half, to 12 cents per share. This comes as a surprise to much of the market, although under new leadership — CEO John Flannery replaced Jeff Immelt on August 1st of this year — we see number-crunchers at the company Thomas Edison once helped found seeing too much capital going out the door when it ought to be put to use internally.An investor meeting at GE commences at this hour to discuss this move, which had actually put GE shares in the green by roughly 1.5% this morning before reversing trend and sending the stock down 1.6%. Year to date, GE shares are down almost 33%. Also, guidance for full-year 2018 have been ratcheted down, from $1.16 per share previously to a range of $1.00-1.07 today.Singles Day OutperformsOver the weekend, while Americans celebrated Veterans Day (mostly by watching football and drinking beer), China procured the “single” largest shopping day in history: Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report)	 alone brought in $25.3 billion on Saturday, with other Chinese online merchants such as JD.com (JD  -  Free Report)	 now joining in the fun. Compare this with Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report)	 Prime Day, which most recently brought in a record amount of revenue for its 30-hour sale: $1 billion.What began as more or less a protest against commercial holidays like Valentine’s Day, “Singles Day,” which began in 2009, is now more broadly known the world over as the “Global Shopping Festival.” As this marketing bonanza continues to grow year after year, we also see some truly remarkable figures, such as 90% — NINETY PERCENT — of Singles Day purchases having been made via mobile. If this doesn’t inspire retailers to go strong into mobile sales from this point forward, they’re clearly just not paying attention.Markets Lower on Asia WeaknessIndexes in Asia overnight sold off, including in Japan and South Korea. We also see selling pressure on the British pound as Brexit processes make their way through the python. Calls for U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May to step down after just a year at 10 Downing Street — with the re-emergence of “fringier” characters on the British political scene like former Mayor of London Boris Johnson — now illustrate the possible reality of a “hard Brexit” analysts had been fearing since the surprise EU secession vote a year and a half ago.Japan’s sell-off continues from what looks essentially like a technical move, following multi-year highs in its market tapping out late last week. The Nikkei index fell by the largest amount since early April, without much to assign blame to but profit-taking and valuation correction. The Japanese yen is increasing in value against virtually al other major currencies, which may create market headwinds as Japanese products and services grow more expensive on the global market.Qualcomm Rejects BroadcomAs widely expected, Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report)	 has rejected rival chip-maker Broadcom’s (AVGO  -  Free Report)	 offer to buy the similarly-sized company for $70 per share. Qualcomm naturally considers the offer too low, and also cited present regulatory uncertainties as reasons for the thumbs-down to Broadcom. We await a follow-up move from Broadcom, but without any indication whether the company will make a more generous offer or simply let this go.Mark VickerySenior EditorToday's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE: BABA) has its biggest weekend of the year: Singles Day. While American shoppers are gearing up for Black Friday and Cyber Monday, Chinese shoppers, particularly younger, single shoppers, are celebrating the Chinese version of an anti-Valentine’s Day by snatching up huge deals on Alibaba’s e-commerce platform. Alibaba registered $12 billion in gross merchandise volume in its first two hours of Singles Day sales on Friday, and analysts are expecting this year’s event to be the biggest ever. Citigroup is calling for $23.8 billion in weekend sales, which are expected to peak at a rate of up to 256,000 transactions per second. Those numbers would be huge market movers for most stocks, but Alibaba shares have been on a tear so far in 2017, and expectations are high. Alibaba stock is now up 92.8 percent from its closing price the day before last year’s Singles Day holiday. With those kind of gains already in place, it may take some huge sales numbers to move the stock on Monday, with analysts calling for a roughly 30 percent increase in Singles Day sales. Here’s a rundown of how the stock has traded on Singles Day in the past: For the first time ever, U.S. investors will have a chance to digest the Singles Day numbers over a weekend and watch to see how the Chinese market reacts before the U.S. market opens on Monday.

Source: Shutterstock Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) has been on fire over the past year, but you wouldn’t know it by the last few days. BAC stock price is down about 5% this week. Time to take profits and hit the road? Not so fast. Let’s take a look at three reasons to stay long BAC Stock. Whether they’re moving up rapidly or not, interest rates are at least moving higher. For years we were stuck at zero or near-zero rates, because the economy lacked oomph. Well, now we’ve got some oomph and this time it really feels sustainable. All of that has led to higher interest rates over the last 15 months. However, we’re still a ways away from “normal rates.” So they should continue to climb over the next few years. The Federal Reserve has been telegraphing that a December rate hike is on the table. That has since become the expectation. While the Fed would like to hike two to three more times in 2018, Wall Street isn’t overwhelmingly confident that will happen. We will see, but the trend is up. Why do rates matter for Bank of America? With one of the largest collections of customer deposits in the country, higher rates allows BAC to earn more money on those deposits. It’s essentially risk-free income. BAC isn’t the only winner, as JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C), Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE:WFC), and other banks benefit too. That brings us to our second point. While BAC stock price is up tremendously over the last 12 months, up 40%, it’s still reasonably priced. Trading with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 13.9 and a forward P/E ratio of 12.4, this is still a really cheap stock. Sales are forecast to grow 5.7% this year and just 3.7% in 2018. However, earnings are expected to grow about 20% in each of those years. Using its trailing P/E ratio and 2018 estimates, it’s not crazy to think BAC stock could trade at $33 to $35 by fiscal year-end 2018. That’s about 25% to 30% upside from current levels and even more if we get a pullback. In August, BAC upped its quarterly dividend to 12 cents per share, a 60% boost from its prior payout. That follows a 50% increase from the following year. Management is no slouch on the buyback, either. Alongside a dividend hike, the company approved a 140% year-over-year increase in the buyback program from $5 billion to $12 billion. This follows a collective $13 billion in buybacks from 2013-2015. Massive? No, not when you consider that BAC stock now sports a $265 billion market cap. But it’s not totally insignificant. No one will ever be like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), but that doesn’t mean buybacks aren’t worthwhile.

After staying quite for a long time Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) shares have recently been behaving interestingly to keep investors awake. Analysts often use price and volume data to predict future stock performance. In the case of BAC, the chart has some interesting things to say about where the stock might be headed. How has the stock performed recently? Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) in the last month has increased +2.63%. Shares are now up over the past year, outperforming the broad market by -100% and outperformed a peer group of similar companies by 225%. After the latest session, which saw the stock close at a price of $26.51, BAC sits below its 52-week high. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) has been trading in a bullish manner, based on the relative positions of the stock’s 20 and 200 day moving averages. Momentum indicators 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that BAC may be headed in the future. To do this, analysts often study the speed and magnitude of a stock’s price movements with what are known as momentum indicators. The logic is that as a stock’s momentum slows, it may be nearing key support or resistance levels and possibly the end of a current trend. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for BAC is 51.28%, which suggests that the stock is not particularly expensive or cheap, and not predisposed to a reactive price movement based on this measure. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 45.54%, tells a similar story, and suggests that BAC currently trades in neutral territory. What do the trading volumes reveal? Analysts use volume trends to assess the level of conviction behind a stock’s price changes. When volumes suddenly increase above normal levels, it can be a sign that investors feel very strongly in one way or the other about the future direction of a stock, or may even have access to inside information. Bank of America Corporation (BAC) average trading volume of 63,033,168 during the past month is 19.74% below its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been less active than usual in the stock in recent times. What do the analysts think? BAC is currently undervalued by -5.96% relative to the average 1-year price target of $28.19 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 2.10, which implies that analysts are generally neutral in their outlook for BAC over the next year. How risky is the stock?  Absolute price performance isn’t the only thing analysts consider when predicting future performance: volatility matters as well. Beta, which measures the stock’s volatility relative to the overall market, is a simple but effective metric for assessing risk. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) has a beta of 1.32, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are more extreme than the market as a whole. BAC therefore has a above average level of market risk. During the past couple of weeks, BAC average daily volatility was 15.87%, which is 2.85 percentage points lower than the average volatility over the past 100 days.

http://kfgo.com/news/articles/2017/nov/14/us-financial-giants-create-consortium-to-vet-third-party-suppliers/

By Dan Freed (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp , JPMorgan Chase & Co , Wells Fargo & Co  and American Express Co , have created a company called TruSight to standardize the work of vetting third party suppliers and partners, according to an announcement Tuesday by the newly-formed consortium. Increasing innovation in financial services has led to more partnerships and more risk events, which are increasingly sophisticated, according to Abel Clark CEO of TruSight and a former Thomson Reuters executive. "There really is a challenge here that is best responded to by a joined-up industry effort," Clark said.    Financial institutions currently vet potential suppliers by sending them questionnaires with hundreds of questions. They then have to work with the supplier to be sure it understood the questions and provided accurate and detailed answers, according to Clark. The banks then have to verify the accuracy of the suppliers' claims through various means, including onsite visits. It is an expensive and time-consuming process with immense potential for banks and suppliers to benefit by sharing best practices and avoiding duplication, Clark said. While TruSight currently has just four backers, Clark said "a small number" of other financial companies may be invited to invest in it in the future. Clark TruSight will begin working on behalf of clients early next year. Clark declined to disclose how much its backers have invested in the company.  (Reporting by Dan Freed in New York)

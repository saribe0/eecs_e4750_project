Biotech stocks are given to high volatility, given several risks confronting the sector, namely FDA decisions, clinical trial results, competitive pressure and drugs falling off patents.  Gilead Sciences, Inc.  (NASDAQ: GILD) — which has made a name for itself in the HIV and hepatitis C treatment spaces —has risks surrounding its outlook, according to Argus.  Argus analyst David Toung issued a downgrade, lowering the firm's rating on Gilead's shares from Buy to Hold. Sales of Gilead's hepatitis C products are deteriorating faster than anticipated, Toung said in a Monday note. (See Toung's track record here.) Fewer patient starts and the  competitive impact  from the launch of a pan-genotype hepatitis C drug by  AbbVie Inc  (NYSE: ABBV) have created headwinds for sales of Epclusa, Toung said. The analyst also projects an accelerated decline in Harvoni and Sovaldi sales.  Gilead's HIV products are plateauing, Toung said. Hepatitis C and HIV products account for 68 percent of Gilead's sales, according to Argus.  "More than two-thirds of Gilead's revenue is on a flat-to-down trajectory," Toung said.  See also:  Attention Biotech Investors: Here Are November PDUFA Catalysts On The Horizon  Gilead faces operating margin pressure in 2018 from declining revenues, as well as higher R&D expenses to support development of the CAR-T  program,  acquired  as part of Gilead's purchase of Kite Pharma Inc  (NASDAQ: KITE), according to Argus.  Argus lowered its adjusted earnings per share estimates for Gilead in 2017 from $8.60 to $8.50 and from $7.50 to $7 in 2018. Gilead was trading down about 1 percent at $73.05 at the time of publication.  Gilead Sciences shares have been up 3.49 percent since the start of the third quarter, outperforming the  iShares NASDAQ Biotechnology Index (ETF)  (NASDAQ: IBB), which has been up 0.68 percent. For the year-to-date period, Gilead has gained only 2.29 percent compared to the iShares NASDAQ Biotechnology Index's 17.64 percent rally Related Link:   A Big Biotech ETF Is About To Get Cheaper

By Chris Lange November 13, 2017 1:30 pm EST

 Gilead Sciences Inc. (NASDAQ: GILD) saw its shares take a step back on Monday after an independent research firm downgraded the stock. Many investors have hoped that the shares will pull out of their holding pattern with some M&A, but this boost only proved temporary. As a result more analysts are taking a more sideline approach to this stock. Argus downgraded Gilead to a Hold rating from Buy based on concerns about a steepening decline of the company’s hepatitis C products and flattening of HIV sales, which account for 68% of revenue. The combination of declining revenue and higher R&D to support development of CAR-T program (acquired in Kite Pharma deal) is expected to pressure the operating margin in 2018. The independent research firm is also lowering its adjusted EPS estimates to $8.50 from $8.60 for 2017 and to $7.00 from $7.50 for 2018 based on its assessment of the company’s slower growth prospects for HIV and hepatitis C drugs. In its report, Argus addressed the recent M&A: Putting behind the euphoria of the Kite Pharma acquisition, we assess the growth drivers for the company in the context of continuing declines in Gilead’s antiviral drugs for HIV and hepatitis C. First of all, as promising and revolutionary is the CART gene-therapy regimen for treating certain blood cancers (acquired in the Kite deal), Gilead does not expect this acquisition to be earnings accretive for at least three years after the close in October 2017. In terms of its declining sales, the slide in hepatitis C sales is due to fewer patient starts as the bulk of sicker patients have been treated. Sales of Epclusa, a pan-genotypic version of the hepatitis C drug, had a strong launch but its growth rate appears to have flattened out. Further, Epclusa faces competition in the pan-genotype space from AbbVie’s Mayvret, which was launched recently in the United States. As for the HIV space, Gilead has brought to the market several newer drugs that have better safety profiles than older drugs. Still, Gilead’s total HIV sales declined 9% in the third quarter, falling from a +2% performance in the second quarter. Total hepatitis C sales fell 34%. As mentioned, HIV and hepatitis C together account for 68% of revenue. Shares of Gilead were last seen down 1.5% at $72.64, with a consensus analyst price target of $84.90 and a 52-week range of $63.76 to $86.27. By Chris Lange

Biotech stocks are given to high volatility, given several risks confronting the sector, namely FDA decisions, clinical trial results, competitive pressure and drugs falling off patents.  Gilead Sciences, Inc.  (NASDAQ: GILD) — which has made a name for itself in the HIV and hepatitis C treatment spaces —has risks surrounding its outlook, according to Argus.  Argus analyst David Toung issued a downgrade, lowering the firm's rating on Gilead's shares from Buy to Hold. Sales of Gilead's hepatitis C products are deteriorating faster than anticipated, Toung said in a Monday note. (See Toung's track record here.) Fewer patient starts and the  competitive impact  from the launch of a pan-genotype hepatitis C drug by  AbbVie Inc  (NYSE: ABBV) have created headwinds for sales of Epclusa, Toung said. The analyst also projects an accelerated decline in Harvoni and Sovaldi sales.  Gilead's HIV products are plateauing, Toung said. Hepatitis C and HIV products account for 68 percent of Gilead's sales, according to Argus.  "More than two-thirds of Gilead's revenue is on a flat-to-down trajectory," Toung said.  See also:  Attention Biotech Investors: Here Are November PDUFA Catalysts On The Horizon  Gilead faces operating margin pressure in 2018 from declining revenues, as well as higher R&D expenses to support development of the CAR-T  program,  acquired  as part of Gilead's purchase of Kite Pharma Inc  (NASDAQ: KITE), according to Argus.  Argus lowered its adjusted earnings per share estimates for Gilead in 2017 from $8.60 to $8.50 and from $7.50 to $7 in 2018.

 The top gainer with a security that increased in price during today’s trading was Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD). Gilead Sciences, Inc. had a higher price at the close than it did at the open. The company holds a market cap of 96.34B with a P/E of 8.4 indicating whether its share price properly reflects its performance. Fundamentalists and value investors are seeing the low ratio of 3.51 as more positive – demonstrating that the company has a great deal of revenue with a fair price. However, technicians believes that a higher ratio would indicate the likelihood of a constant augmentation of the company’s share price. Gilead Sciences, Inc.’s P/B is valued at 3.88 exhibiting the investor sentiment on the value of the stock to its actual value. A higher P/B ratio of Gilead Sciences, Inc. is signposting that the investors have either overvalued it , or that its accountants have undervalued it. The P/B figure is also providing some ideas on whether the shareholders are paying too much for what would be left if the company went bankrupt immediately – but to consider that the company ought to have a lower P/B value. As of now, the increased share price of Gilead Sciences, Inc. makes it a lucrative buy for investors. A change of 1.03% in the price clearly indicates a strong asset performance for the corporation, , bearing in mind the total returns from its investment and dividends or distributions obtained from the investment. The ROA of Gilead Sciences, Inc. is currently valued at 19.40% indicating how profitable the company is in regards to its total assets. The figure tells us what earnings were generated from invested capital of Gilead Sciences, Inc.. It gives investors a clue on how effective the company is in converting the money it has to invest into net income. Gilead Sciences, Inc.’s ROI is valued at 31.00% relatively measuring the profitability on the investment. It evidently points out how profitable and preferable it is for the investors. The company has a current ratio of 3.7 gauging towards its ability in paying short-term and long-term obligations. With the existing current ratio, Gilead Sciences, Inc. is more than equipped to confront its liabilities with its assets. Gilead Sciences, Inc. has a quick ratio of 3.6 measuring its ability to meet its short term obligations with its most liquid assets. The high quick ratio specifies its better liquidity position on the credit terms the company has negotiated from its suppliers. The EPS growth this year is at -16.50% demonstrating an EPS growth of -20.81% in the coming year. This defines the most likely future of the stock price of Gilead Sciences, Inc.. With this high EPSGR it is predicted that growth rate will rise faster as compared to its competitors in the same industry. As it upholds an amended rate with more EPSGR it is prone to be a good target. Gilead Sciences, Inc.

Big fans of Amazon will like this tablet’s beautiful screen, good performance, and long battery life for a low price. Everyone else won’t like the strong ties to this retailer that are baked in. Amazon Fire HD 10 The Amazon Fire HD 10 is this company’s biggest and most powerful tablet, but it’s still less than $150. That budget price gets a 10.1-inch, high-resolution display, much better performance than its predecessors, and twice as much memory. But what sets it apart from the crowd is hands-free support for the Alexa personal voice assistant. Read our in-depth review to see if this Amazon slate lives up to its potential. The bezels on this tablet’s 10.1-inch screen modernly sized, so the length and height of this tablet isn’t much larger than its display: 10.3 by 6.3 inches.  Premium devices tend to be very slim and light, so the 0.4 inch thickness and 1.1 pound heft make it clear this is a budget model. It’s not terribly bulky, but it is thicker and heavier than more expensive options. A plastic casing with rounded edges and corners covers the sides and back. Shoppers can choose from black, blue, and red options. Silver buttons add a touch of class, and are easy to see. A large Amazon logo is on the back. Build quality is fine, with the external parts coming together nicely. And the Fire HD 10 feels solid. Our test unit flexed only marginally when we attempted to bend it, though there was a slight creaking noise. The plastic casing is moderately easy to scratch, however. The 10.1-inch screen has a 1920 x 1200 resolution, resulting in 224 pixels per inch.  In layman’s terms, that’s a very nice display, with more pixels crammed into each square inch than most of its rivals; only the most expensive tablets have more. The screen is quite bright. We found the 2017 version of the Fire HD 10 quite easy to use outside, if not in direct sunlight. And colors are vivid. Combined with the high pixel density, all the video, images, and text we looked at in our testing appeared bright and clear. This tablet offers wide viewing angles; wide enough that two people can watch a movie or TV show together. Amazon chose a 16:10 aspect ratio, which means that, in landscape mode, it’s shaped like a widescreen TV. In portrait mode, it’s much thinner than a piece of letter paper.  The Fire HD 10 doesn’t offer side-by-side multitasking. There’s no way to display two applications on screen at the same time. This is a feature available on more expensive models, and it’s too bad it’s missing from this one, as it works well on screens with this aspect ratio. On the top edge of this computer is a micro-USB port, used for charging the battery, but also much more. We recommend investing $5 or $10 in an adapter to convert micro-USB to regular USB Type-A, as this will allow the Fire HD 10 to access standard thumbdrives, keyboards, and mice. We successfully tested the tablet with a USB hub and all three of those types of peripherals simultaneously.  Amazon didn’t leave out a microSD removable memory card slot. This supports up to 256 GB cards, though we only tested our unit with a 64 GB one. There’s a 3.5 mm speaker port, which is good because the built-in speakers don’t have much power. More on this in the next section. As mentioned, the buttons on the Fire HD 10 are silver to make them easier to see. There are only two of them, both on the top edge: one is for Power, the other is a volume rocker. The front-facing VGA camera is adequate for video conferencing. The 2 MP rear-facing camera can do 720p HD video recording.  A pair of speakers can be found on the left edge of this tablet. Rotating the device to landscape to watch video puts the speakers on the top edge. This isn’t front facing, but at least they aren’t on the back of the device like far too many tablets. These speakers put out a moderate amount of sound. In our testing, we could easily hear the audio from a movie while sitting 3 feet away in a somewhat noisy room. However, that required turning the speakers up all the way. Listening to music or  a podcast from the other side of a room required hooking up an external speaker. These include Dolby Atmos, so that movies that also support this technology can mimic surround sound. The 2017 version of the Amazon Fire HD 10  has a quad-core processor made by MediaTek. Two of these cores run at 1.81 GHz for more performance, or the tablet can switch to dual 1.4 GHz cores to save power.  We tested it with Geekbench 4 to see how well it stacked up against the current competition:  Amazon promised that this device is 30% faster than its immediate predecessor. Based on the benchmark scores, it more than surpasses that goal. The Fire HD (2017) also performs better than all the similarly-priced models we compared it against. It was solidly beaten by the latest 9.7-inch iPad, but that costs about twice as much. This tablet includes 1.77 GB of RAM. While minimal, this is adequate, especially as this tablet can’t run two applications side-by-side. Buyers have a choice between 32 GB and 64 GB of storage, twice as much as earlier FIre models. In addition, users can store items on microSD cards, and Amazon offers free unlimited cloud storage for content purchased from this retailer (movies, books, games, etc.) Amazon has an unusual strategy for its tablets. According to this company, the latest Fire HD 10 runs Fire OS 5.6, which will surely leave most people scratching their heads. The “Fire OS” is just a skin covering Google’s Android OS. So, under the hood, the Fire HD 10 is actually running Android 5.6. What this whole “Fire OS” business really means for users is that Amazon has replaced Google’s standard home screen with one that heavily emphasizes all its products. And it has stripped out Google’s app store and put in its own. Plus, Google Maps, Google Docs, Gmail, etc. aren’t available under Fire OS. Among the other results, the use of Fire OS makes this a very consumer-oriented device. Most notably, there’s no versions of Word, Excel, etc. in the Amazon App store, though OneDrive is available. Amazon does provide basic replacements so it’s possible to, for example, edit a Word document emailed from the office while on vacation. But this isn’t something that practical on a daily basis. The news isn’t all bad. Amazon was able to build hands-free support for Alexa in the Fire HD 10 (2017). This means that, from across the room, one can just say something like “Alexa, what’s the weather forecast?” and the tablet will read out current conditions. And because this is a tablet, visuals for many of the requests are shown on screen as well. This service is very powerful, and getting better all the time. Optional third-party services can tie into Alexa (called “Skills”) to add new features like a daily Jeopardy mini-game. Just be aware that Alexa is listening all the time, not just when you’re making requests. Amazon makes it clear that it is recording and saving as much of this  audio as it wants to. Fortunately, Alexa Hands-Free can be easily toggled on and off. Amazon promises 10 hours of battery life, so of course we put this to the test. We set up our unit to play video streamed over Wi-Fi with the screen set at 50%. The Amazon Fire HD 10 (2017) lasted 11 hours and 36 minutes in this torture test, That’s a fine amount, if not as long as many rival devices. It’s a solid day of heavy use. Battery life comparison chart (listed in minutes):
 We were concerned that always-on Alexa would be a drain on the battery, as it requires the device to be constantly listening, but that’s not really the case. We left this tablet sitting unplugged for 24 hours, making only infrequent Alexa requests and using it for nothing else, and the battery was at 81% at the end of this test. In our testing with the wall plug and cable bundled with this device, one hour of charging resulted in the battery going up 28%, so plan for 3 to four hours to recharge the Fire HD 10, depending on how depleted it is. While faster charging is always better, at least you can count on a complete recharge overnight. Budget tablets are generally focused on consumers, and the Fire HD 10 (2017) has an even narrower focus: consumers who are big fans of Amazon. But those who are in this group will find that this device has a beautiful screen, good performance, and long battery life for a low price. Everyone else could easily find that this model, like all the Fire tablets, is too tied to Amazon to suit them. As discussed, the base model Fire HD 10 is $149.99. This comes with 32 GB of storage. The 64 GB variant is $189.99. Getting these prices requires accepting Amazon advertisements on the unlock screen and in the notifications, however. Either version costs an additional $15 to leave off these “Special Offers”. These aren’t onerous, so saving the $15 is probably worth it. Another way to look at this device is that it can do everything an Amazon Echo Show can do, plus more, and at a lower price. In addition, Amazon is offering folio cases with built-in stands in a variety of colors. These sell for $39.99. Pros: Cons:

https://www.wired.com/2017/11/review-amazon-fire-hd-8-kids-edition-2017/

It happens to every parent. Maybe you’re on the treadmill after work and realize that you’re singing the Chuggington theme song while running. Or you’re at a dinner party, engaging in fluid discourse on the world-building in Zootopia versus Kung Fu Panda. Your family has become a hive mind. Whatever media your children consume, you also consume—and not only is this not a bad thing, it is also probably a hallmark of responsible parenting. The Amazon Fire HD 8 Kids Edition is the affordable tablet that will provide the maximum amount of enjoyment to the most members in your family, which is something to consider if you have children of different ages using the same tablet, or if you, the parent, let yourself get snookered into watching one more episode of Little Baby Bum before bed.  The first difference that you will see between Amazon’s 7- and 8-inch tablets is the larger, clearer HD display. While your toddler might not notice, you and older children will appreciate that extra inch of color and clarity when watching movies or playing games. Minecraft (for older kids) and the Sago Mini games (for younger ones) were bright and immersive, and played without any noticeable lag time.   The second difference is the sound. Unlike the Fire 7 for Kids, the Fire 8 for Kids has two Dolby Atmos speakers, instead of one, and they are not largely obscured by the included puffy child-proof case. The difference in volume and clarity is immediate and shocking. Going from one to the other is like taking cotton balls out of your ears.  The third is the battery life. My run test of watching videos and surfing took a little over the advertised twelve hours to use the entire battery. But twelve hours of battery life is a looooong time, with curfews installed and each child profile—you can set two parents and up to four children per device—limited to one hour of tablet time per day. Three days of toddler usage and parent fiddling barely dented the battery life, which went down to a mere 76%.  Durable. Affordable. Plenty of content to please all ages, even those who are well over 12. Parental controls are strict, but easily adjusted (by the parent). Can easily monitor the usage of multiple kids. Hard to smuggle in non-Amazon content. Camera isn’t very good. And like the Fire 7 for Kids, the Fire 8 for Kids also offers the same two-year worry-free guarantee and a year’s free subscription to FreeTime Unlimited, the subscription platform that gives your child access to a spectacular array of age-appropriate books, games, apps and videos from ages three to twelve. For example, when I created a ten-year-old child profile, every Harry Potter book immediately showed up, as well as Tolkien’s The Silmarillion and other classics like Tron. So I can guarantee that your child will be thrilled, as long as your child is also me.  As with the Fire 7 Kids, however, my main gripe is with the parental controls. Most parents buy the kids editions for their ability to keep their children from running rampant through all the dark and seedy corners of the Internet. The controls are incredibly customizable by accessing settings on your parent profile. You can choose as many or as few restrictions on your child’s FreeTime profile as you like. You can block the camera, block in-app purchasing, and monitor your child’s usage via the FreeTime app on the parent profile or online.  The problem arises when you try to watch or play something that is not part of the Amazon universe. While FreeTime offers an amazing array of content, and you can access even more goodies if you have a Prime subscription—let’s be honest, if you’re looking at a Fire you probably already have one—fighting your way out of Amazon’s clutches is a struggle.  While younger children, and probably most adults, would be happy with Amazon’s content, older kids will want apps like YouTube Kids. It is possible to transfer a lot of things into the child’s FreeTime profile, but prepare to spend some time puzzling through the workarounds, especially if you make the seemingly reasonable assumption that parental controls don’t apply to the parent profiles. Get used to typing your parental password and PIN a lot of times as you install everything twice—first on your profile, then on theirs.  Also, downloading everything necessary to get the Google Play store up and running took up a significant proportion of the 26.57 GB of usable internal storage. If you have multiple children downloading movies and games, you will probably need to buy an SD card.  Finally, the camera is still not good. Pictures were fuzzy, which is even more noticeable on the larger screen. But it does have a mic, and grandparents on Skype probably won’t mind that that those tiny little faces aren’t as clear as they might otherwise be. Even the strictest of parents has to admit that there is some basic injustice being done to our tiny people, who watch us check Twitter all day on our portable screens as we tell them, hey, play with this little wooden car. The Fire HD 8 Kids Edition is a useful compromise of a device—durable, enjoyable, and at $130, way cheaper than an iPad mini (Amazon is also fond of putting these on sale frequently, so check often for deals).  And as far as parenting goes, it is probably better in the long run that the nannyware is harder, rather than easier, to get around. Who needs a billion KIDZ BOP videos anyway? Just read The Silmarillion instead! No? Really? When you buy something using the retail links in our product reviews, we earn a small affiliate commission. Read more about how this works.

It happens to every parent. Maybe you’re on the treadmill after work and realize that you’re singing the Chuggington theme song while running. Or you’re at a dinner party, engaging in fluid discourse on the world-building in Zootopia versus Kung Fu Panda. Your family has become a hive mind. Whatever media your children consume, you also consume—and not only is this not a bad thing, it is also probably a hallmark of responsible parenting. The Amazon Fire HD 8 Kids Edition is the affordable tablet that will provide the maximum amount of enjoyment to the most members in your family, which is something to consider if you have children of different ages using the same tablet, or if you, the parent, let yourself get snookered into watching one more episode of Little Baby Bum before bed.  The first difference that you will see between Amazon’s 7- and 8-inch tablets is the larger, clearer HD display. While your toddler might not notice, you and older children will appreciate that extra inch of color and clarity when watching movies or playing games. Minecraft (for older kids) and the Sago Mini games (for younger ones) were bright and immersive, and played without any noticeable lag time.   The second difference is the sound. Unlike the Fire 7 for Kids, the Fire 8 for Kids has two Dolby Atmos speakers, instead of one, and they are not largely obscured by the included puffy child-proof case. The difference in volume and clarity is immediate and shocking. Going from one to the other is like taking cotton balls out of your ears.  The third is the battery life. My run test of watching videos and surfing took a little over the advertised twelve hours to use the entire battery. But twelve hours of battery life is a looooong time, with curfews installed and each child profile—you can set two parents and up to four children per device—limited to one hour of tablet time per day.

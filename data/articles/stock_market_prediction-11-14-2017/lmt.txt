 Defense behemoth Lockheed Martin Corp. 's LMT Rotary Mission Systems business division secured a modification contract, to support the AEGIS weapon system (AWS). Work related to this deal is expected to be over by November 2018. Details of the Deal Valued at $60.2 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C. Per the terms of the agreement, Lockheed Martin will conduct  ship integration and test of the AWS for AWS baselines through Advanced Capability Build 12. Majority of the work will be executed in Camden, NJ; Norfolk, VA; Pascagoula, MS; and Moorestown, NJ.  Fiscal 2012 and 2013 shipbuilding and conversion; fiscal 2017 and 2018 other procurement; and fiscal 2018 operations and maintenance funds will be used to partly finance the deal. A Brief-Note on AWS Lockheed Martin's AWS is the world's premier naval air defense system and the sea-based element of the United States' Ballistic Missile Defense System. It is a seamlessly integrated radar and missile system, which has the capability to provide protection against advanced air, surface and subsurface threats. A key component of the AWS is the SPY-1 multi-function phased array radar - the world's most advanced and versatile maritime radar. Our View Lockheed Martin's Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) business carries out some of the company's high-profile programs, including the Aegis Combat System, Littoral Combat Ship, MH-60 helicopter avionics along with military and commercial orders. At present, Lockheed Martin's Aegis system is a sought-after maritime weapon system for nations like Australia, Japan, Norway and Spain. In the third quarter the RMS unit's revenues witnessed a year-over-year improvement. Going ahead, the latest contract for the AWS is expected to provide further impetus to this unit's growth. Additionally, the recently passed fiscal 2018 defense policy, authorizing the United States' defense spending worth $700 billion, has enhanced the prospect of increased order flow from Pentagon for major defense contractors like Lockheed Martin, Raytheon Company RTN , Northrop Grumman Corporation NOC , The Boeing Company BA and others. Price Performance Shares of Lockheed Martin have rallied 17.7% over a year underperforming the industry 's 31% gain. This could be because the earlier budget cuts might have put pressure on the top line.    Zacks Rank Lockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) stock took a hit today with the release of its earnings report for the third quarter of 2017. Source: Praveer Sharma via Flickr Lockheed Martin Corporation’s earnings report for the third quarter of year started off bad with earnings per share of $3.24. This is down from its earnings per share of $7.93 from the same time last year. It also wasn’t able to reach Wall Street’s earnings per share estimate of $3.26, which isn’t good news for LMT stock. Revenue of $12.17 billion for the third quarter of 2017 also didn’t do LMT stock any favors. Analysts were looking for Lockheed Martin Corporation to report revenue of $12.81 billion during the quarter. Still, it was an increase over its revenue of $11.55 billion from the third quarter of 2016.

The earnings cycle is sending some mixed signals for the first time this quarter as three more widely watched stocks provided just “OK” earnings results for the quarter. With the major indices trading at their all-time highs, “OK” results are usually likely to cause traders to start hitting the “sell” button, as we’re seeing on a few stocks today. Today’s three big stock charts analyze the price patterns of Biogen Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) and McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) as two out of three of these companies are trading lower in the wake of their earnings results creating potential buying opportunities.  Biogen shares traded strongly right into their earnings report, suggesting that the company needed to nail their earnings report to avoid a “sell the news” situation that would take BIIB stock back into its trading range. The report didn’t blow investor’s hair back, so let’s see what the chart says now:  Defense stocks have been among the groups of stocks posting strong, low volatility rallies, you know, the kind everyone likes. The problem happens when a company like that misses earnings, the way that Lockheed Martin did. This quarter’s results missed expectations, although management did guide forward earnings higher, which is the saving grace right now. So, is LMT stock a buy on this dip?

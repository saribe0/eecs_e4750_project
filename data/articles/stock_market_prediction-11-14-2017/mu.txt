 Marshall Allen, one of the youngest of the original 11 members of the Concerned Student 1950 group, on Monday evening asked for the recently enacted speech codes at the University of Missouri to be viewed from the perspectives of those protesters.In the fall of 2015, along with blocking the Homecoming parade to send a message to then-UM System President Tim Wolfe and camping out on Traditions Plaza to support Jonathan Butler's hunger strike, Concerned Student 1950 demonstrators protested at the financial aid office and in the office of interim Vice Chancellor Chuck Henson.Now the speech codes prohibit entering offices with vital university records, protests in or outside official meetings and camping on campus.“The reason why we can claim these and promote these as reactionary is because each of these have direct correlation to the events and activities that occurred in the fall of 2015,” he said.Yet on Friday, at a meeting of the Board of Curators, three white demonstrators quietly unfurled signs asking the university to divest from fossil fuel companies. Curators Chairman Maurice Graham and President Mun Choi spoke to the demonstrators and, in a brief comment to the Tribune, Graham affirmed the system’s commitment to free speech.Allen, who was a sophomore in 2015 and is now a senior, questioned that in light of the new policies that would otherwise have forbidden it.“You are officially acting against and in violation of university policy,” Allen said. “Who exactly do these policies apply to?”Allen spoke at an event sponsored by the MU Department of Black Studies called “Two Years After …” intended to measure how much has changed – and how much hasn’t – since Wolfe resigned Nov. 9, 2015. The audience that packed Wrench Auditorium saw Spike Lee’s movie about the protests, “2 Fists Up,” and heard Allen question whether university and state policies enacted since have been properly viewed from a black perspective.Along with students and faculty, the event drew President Mun Choi, Curator David Steelman and other university leaders. Afterward, Choi said the discussion made him proud because it shows the university is willing to look at issues that are important to students, faculty and staff.“There were comments during the presentation and afterward, if the new policies on protests are going to apply to all students or all faculty regardless of their background or experience,” Choi said. “They will, and I truly want to emphasize that.”Along with questioning the new university policies, Allen raised issues with the new state law on discrimination claims that generated a travel warning for Missouri from the NAACP. Before the change, he said, it was difficult to prove discrimination under the standard that it was a “contributing factor” to a prohibited job or housing action. The new standard is that it is the “motivating factor.”“When you couldn’t prove it before, now it is impossible,” Allen said.When the Tiger football team joined the protests in the first week of November by threatening to boycott a game, the media spotlight, already on the campus because of the demonstrations, became intense. After Wolfe resigned and Columbia campus Chancellor R. Bowen Loftin was forced out, a backlash began that included condemnation from then-presidential candidate Donald Trump.“I think it’s disgusting,” Trump said. “I think the two people who resigned are weak, ineffective people. I think when they resigned they set something in motion that is going to be a disaster for a long period of time.”The university has lost 13 percent of its enrollment and while it has protected promised support for diversity and inclusion amid budget cuts, it has not met the goal for black faculty in the Concerned Student 1950 demands.Stephanie Shonekan, chair of the Black Studies Department, said the event Monday was to show how much progress has been made on the issues identified by the protesters. She noted the presence of Choi. One of the major ways Wolfe angered the Concerned Student 1950 group was by ignoring them when they blocked his car during the parade.“Our role also on this campus is to serve as the intellectual side of black life at the University of Missouri,” she said. “Tonight we want to talk about how far we have come. And we wanted to push back against the other president who said we would be a disaster. We have not been a disaster. He’s wrong.”Among the audience were several current and prospective students who have arrived in Columbia since the protests.Clodwige Meginord, 28, arrived in Columbia in August and is planning to enter MU in pursuit of a post-graduate degree. She was born in Haiti and came to U.S. 25 years ago.“I think for anyone who would like to be part of an institution that has history and have people who are willing to stand for the truth, you should be here,” she said. “Because you can be the next voice, the next phase of the truth, whatever the truth is for you.”Johanna Milord, a doctoral student in counseling psychology, said the events of 2015 drew her to MU after attending a psychology conference with student and faculty presenters from the university.In 2015, she said, the protests against blacks dying at the hands of police received no discussion on the campus she attended.“I remember feeling frustrated and silenced and not knowing really where to go,” she said.The conference showed her that at MU, faculty and students work together on issues.“I think that this is a place where the conversation is happening and that is more than I have been exposed to in the past,” she said.rkeller@columbiatribune.com573-815-1709  Marshall Allen, one of the youngest of the original 11 members of the Concerned Student 1950 group, on Monday evening asked for the recently enacted speech codes at the University of Missouri to be viewed from the perspectives of those protesters.

   Minister of State for Higher and Technical Education Ravindra Waikar on Monday announced that Mumbai University students could be allowed to take supplementary answer sheets in their exams. The MU had earlier banned students from taking supplements as it led to mistakes in the online assessment marking system.  Mr. Waikar said, “Problems arose when teachers gave separate bar codes for supplement sheets and main answer sheets. This led to confusion and many students lost marks for their supplements. The marks ended up being given to other students. I have directed teachers to give the same bar codes for main and supplement answer sheets. Students cannot be stopped from asking for supplement papers beyond the 40 pages in the main answer sheets.” However, teachers have been asked to check if students had left any blank pages in the main pages before asking for supplement sheets.  Mr. Waikar said from the next semester, the results would be declared within 45 days of the exams. He said, “In May, teachers were not handed over answer sheets until three months after the exams, thereby delaying results. This time, the November 8 exam papers have already reached teachers for correction.”  The Minister directed MU officials to clear bottlenecks in the online assessment system to ensure results are declared within 45 days.  Meanwhile, president of the Students’ Law Council, Sachin Pawar, has sought postponement of the first semester exams of the five-year Bachelor of Business Administration and Bachelor of Law courses scheduled for November 20, as the rule of a minimum of 90 days of academic instruction before exams was not met.  Activists of the Yuva Sena, youth wing of Shiv Sena, accompanied Mr. Waikar when he visited the Fort campus.

http://www.columbiatribune.com/news/20171110/consultant-harsh-report-not-meant-to-end-mu-greek-system

 The need for the consulting report that recommends banning freshman from living in fraternity houses, stronger supervision of parties and a more engaged administration at the University of Missouri was apparent soon after Gary Ward added student affairs to his duties.During a town hall Friday on the findings and recommendations of the Dyad Strategies report, Ward said he had been on the job for a day in May when hundreds of emails started flooding his inbox. Ward, who retains his previous duties as vice-chancellor for campus operations, said he was astonished.“There were two things I realized,” Ward said. “First, I was scared to death. I was hearing very disturbing things that put me in concern for the university. The second thing was the amount of passion.”Afterward, Ward declined to give specifics about the events that disturbed him, only saying it was happening in parties in fraternity houses. The report found evidence of coerced drinking by underage students, hazing and an oversight office with no “overarching goals, objectives or priorities."Gentry McCreary, the consultant who wrote the report, spent most of two hours going over the findings and recommendations, and answering submitted questions. He began by assuring the gathering of about 150, including Greek chapter members and alumni who act as advisors or corporate board members, that his report wasn’t intended to end fraternity and sorority life on campus.“One of the things I have heard is, ‘Oh, gosh, this is the first step in the university getting rid of Greek life,’” McCreary said. “I have heard that feedback and I have heard that sentiment. Let me tell you from the outset that if I had thought that were true, I would never have agreed to do this job.”McCreary also apologized for not reviewing chapter grade reports available online. The report originally included information that freshmen who live in fraternity houses do worse academically than their classmates who live in dormitories. That sentence was removed after a Columbia Missourian report questioning its accuracy.Along with online reports, Dyad received data before it began its study showing that fraternity and sorority members who have entered MU since 2009 have higher retention and graduation rates than their non-Greek classmates. That data, provided to the Tribune under a Sunshine Law request, shows 71 percent of fraternity members and 83 percent of sorority members graduate within five years, compared to 60 percent of non-Greek students.“There are people who have wanted to discredit my entire report because of one inaccurate statement and if that is your prerogative it is certainly your right to feel that way,” McCreary said. “It didn’t change any of the recommendations.”Fraternities and sororities on campus are divided into four groups. The oldest, dating to 1869, are traditionally white fraternities and sororities of the Interfraternity Council and the Panhellenic Association, which today are required to be inclusive in their membership. There is also the National Panhellenic Council, which governs traditionally black fraternities and sororities, and the Multicultural Greek Council, the newest group, with some organizations that are open to all students and others targeting particular campus communities.The riskiest behavior identified in the report — parties with hard alcohol, freshmen being hazed, freshmen allowed to drink while underage and lack of older students in the chapter houses — is in the Interfraternity Council chapters, McCreary said.Sororities generally don’t allow freshmen to live in their chapter houses and the other governing groups typically don’t have chapter houses and recruit students in their second or third year on campus, he said.“So this was taking about freshmen living in houses and that was geared more specifically to the IFC,” McCreary said. “They certainly are involved in the behavior that seems to be the highest risk.”Since the report was issued Oct. 24, the public response from Greek organizations has been muted. Those contacted have turned down requests for interviews. A series of private discussions, held by invitation only, will begin Monday.Devin Tarantino, president of the Interfraternity Council, was reluctant to state any views on the report after the meeting.“We don’t want any misinformation going out to the media so we want to make sure what we have going out is correct,” Tarantino said. “I think it would be more difficult for the public to get misinformation and have us unwind it.”The report is being taken seriously by the fraternities, said Trevor Beshear, vice president of public relations for the council.“When you look at it, this report, some of the things may be tough to hear but it is about moving forward and making our community one of the best in the country, and the safest,” he said.Ward and Dean of Students Jeff Zeilenga emphasized that the goal is a safer, more academically-minded system for fraternities and sororities. The chapters raise large sums for charities and spearhead the annual blood drive that collects thousands of units of blood for the Red Cross, Ward said.“We are going to be the nation’s model for Greek life,” Ward said. “I don’t know how we define that but we are going to do that together.”rkeller@columbiatribune.com573-815-1709 The need for the consulting report that recommends banning freshman from living in fraternity houses, stronger supervision of parties and a more engaged administration at the University of Missouri was apparent soon after Gary Ward added student affairs to his duties.

The chapters raise large sums for charities and spearhead the annual blood drive that collects thousands of units of blood for the Red Cross, Ward said. “We are going to be the nation’s model for Greek life,” Ward said. “I don’t know how we define that but we are going to do that together.” rkeller@columbiatribune.com 573-815-1709

 The University of Missouri School of Medicine hopes to help blunt the opioid abuse health crisis with a new course to teach health care providers across the state about the dangers of the painkilling drugs.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, overdose deaths in Missouri from synthetic opioids increased 63.2 percent between 2014 and 2015. Opioids are painkilling drugs such as morphine, codeine, heroin and fentanyl.The Show-Me ECHO program, Missouri’s chapter of the nationwide program, began in 2015 and is run through the Missouri Telehealth Network at the MU School of Medicine. School officials said MU recognized the need to educate health care providers about opioid addiction and abuse.“We became increasingly aware of the crisis,” said Karen Edison, medical director of the Show-Me ECHO program. “We’ve been doing a chronic pain ECHO since the beginning, so we see the chronic pain” class “as the prevention and the opioid use disorder” class “as the treatment.”Show-Me ECHO began its opioid program on Sept. 8. With more than 100 users registered, the program meets virtually on the second and fourth Friday of each month from 11:45 a.m. to 1 p.m.Show-Me ECHO also offers sessions on asthma, autism, child psychology, chronic pain management, community health, dermatology, health care ethics and hepatitis C.The goal of the opioid use disorder program is to spread knowledge to parts of Missouri that don’t have as much access to health care.“You’re going to be getting specialty information out to all areas of Missouri, the rural, underserved, uninsured and underinsured,” said Misty Jordan, ECHO’s coordinator for opioid use disorder.Each session begins with an introduction of the experts. For the opioid use disorder class, the team consists of two addiction psychiatrists, a pharmacist, a social worker, a clinical psychologist, a primary care addictionologist and a health literacy expert.“In that ECHO, we teach a medication-first strategy to decrease” disease and death, Edison said. “We also teach evidence-based principles that reduce harm and encourage recovery and support. We teach compassionate, patient-centered care for individuals who are addicted to opioids. Our whole approach is aimed at keeping people alive.”The experts go over the specific topic planned for each section. For the opioid use disorder class, topics include reducing barriers to treatment for opioid use disorder, the neuroscience of addiction and strategies to prevent relapse in addicts.Participants can present anonymous cases to discuss, ask questions and receive recommendations.Megan Cates, a doctor of osteopathic medicine at Family Health Center in Columbia, attends the opioid sessions. She has also taken the chronic pain management course and will begin the child psychology session soon.“The ECHOs are” a “great learning opportunity,” Cates said. “The opioid use disorder in general is a big issue. We’ve all heard of the opioid epidemic and I wanted to hear more about it. It’s a great way to learn more from people who are treating it.”The opioid class will last until March.Jordan said health care providers will not be experts after completing a session, but the increased knowledge will help them and their patients.“You’re educating yourself,” Jordan said. “It’s going to get wait times shorter and make the whole medical system more efficient.”   The University of Missouri School of Medicine hopes to help blunt the opioid abuse health crisis with a new course to teach health care providers across the state about the dangers of the painkilling drugs.

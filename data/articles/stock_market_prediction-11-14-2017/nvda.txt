A successful investor understands the importance of adding well-performing stocks to the portfolio at the right time. NVIDIA Corporation NVDA is one such technology stock that has been on a healthy growth trajectory of late. Shares of this California-based graphic chip behemoth have rallied nearly 5% since its reported solid third-quarter fiscal 2018 results. Moreover, the stock has been clocking solid returns in the last year and has soared 158.4%, outperforming the industry's gain of 60.3% over the same period. The stock has an estimated long-term earnings growth rate of 11.2%. With solid prospects, this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock is an attractive pick at the moment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Stellar Performance in Q3 NVIDIA posted earnings of $1.33 per share on non-GAAP basis, up nearly 60.2% year over year. Non-GAAP earnings also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 94 cents per share. The year-over-year rise in the bottom line mainly stemmed from significant revenue growth along with gross margin and operating margin expansion. Revenues surged 31.5% year over year to $2.636 billion.  The figure also comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.364 billion as well as management’s projection of $2.35 billion (+/-2%). The year-over-year jump is primarily attributable to growth across all the platforms — the GPUs gaming platform, Professional Visualization, datacenter and Tegra automotive platforms. Further, NVIDIA continued to gain strength in the artificial intelligence (AI) space, which positively impacted the quarter’s revenues. Raised Guidance For fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, NVIDIA expects revenues of approximately $2.65 billion (+/-2%), which is much higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.44 billion. For fiscal 2018, the company continues to expect returning $1.25 billion to its shareholders in the form of cash dividends and share repurchases. Estimates Northbound Estimates for NVIDIA have moved up in the past seven days, reflecting the optimistic outlook of analysts. Earnings estimates for the current quarter have jumped 5.1% while that of next quarter moved up 3.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is $2.44 billion for current quarter, displaying 12.3% year-over-year growth. Revenues for fiscal 2018 are estimated to be $8.99 billion, reflecting 30% annual growth. For the current quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.03, depicting year-over-year growth of 3.5% while that for fiscal 2018 of $3.66 displays a rise of 42.6%. Positive Earnings Surprise History NVIDIA has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, delivering a positive average earnings surprise of 33.5%. Growth Drivers The company’s sustained focus on introducing fast and innovative products as well as agreements with leading PC game makers have been driving its Gaming GPU business. During the quarter, NVIDIA announced the launch of the new high end graphic card, GeForce GTX 1070 1070 Ti. Available from Nov 2, the card was released to take down AMD’s $400 Radeon Vega 56. We believe this will take the gaming experience to a new level. Hence, the launch of this product will enable NVIDIA to increase its customer base and help in garnering additional revenues. NVIDIA also collaborated with Square Enix to unveil Final Fantasy XV Windows Edition for PC in Gamescom 2017, which is aimed at bringing an enhanced gaming experience to PCs. This deal is a positive for NVIDIA, as it will help the company gain market share among gaming content developers.  Moreover, it joined forces with Activision to bring Destiny 2 online game to the PC for the first time. The company’s Volta-based V100 accelerator was the most notable launch of late. The Volta V100 GPU provides 10 times more deep learning power to the company’s year-old predecessor, Pascal generation GPUs. Recently, Alibaba, Baidu BIDU and Tencent announced that they are adopting NVIDIA Volta GPUs in their datacenters and cloud server, joining Amazon, Facebook, Alphabet’s GOOGL Google and Microsoft MSFT. Demand for NVIDIA’s HGX AI supercomputer also remained high as more organizations are keen on building AI-enabled applications. The company stated that Huawei, Inspur and Lenovo will be using its Volta HGX architecture to build AI systems for datacenters. During the quarter, NVIDIA launched TensorRT programmable inference acceleration platform, thereby improving the performance and reducing the cost of AI inferencing. Notably, more than 1,200 companies are already using this inference platform, including Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, Google, Alibaba, Baidu, Hi Vision and Tencent. The company also unveiled a new AI supercomputer chip designed for self-driving cars called Pegasus at its GPU Technology Conference in Europe. This new technology helps to drive fully autonomous robotaxis which can handle the concept of Level 5 self-driving vehicles and uses NVIDIA’s DRIVE PX 2 platform, trained on deep neural networks. Per the company, the new system is capable of delivering 320 trillion operations per second of performance, which is more than 10 times compared with its predecessor. To Conclude We expect these factors to help the company sustain strong momentum and stay afloat amid difficult times. Consequently, we suggest that investors buy the stock for the time being. Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?  Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge. With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research. It's not the one you think.

Source: Shutterstock Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has had a banner 2017. The NVDA stock price has doubled so far this year, and it has more than tripled in the last 12 months. NVDA news seemingly has been nothing but positive. Even in a very strong market for large-cap tech, NVDA stock has been a star. But the stock hasn’t been without its skeptics. It seems like ages ago, but as recently as early March NVDA had pulled back more than 15% and dipped below $100 on a pair of analyst downgrades. I’ve expressed some concerns along the way as well, citing potential competition from rivals like improving Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and an awakened Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). At this point, however, the bear case for NVDA stock seems shattered. The company posted another earnings blowout last week. Artificial intelligence adoption is gaining speed. The valuation looks high – but NVDA news is nothing but good and there are years of growth ahead of the company. Over the past few years, Nvidia has made fools of bearish observers (myself included). At this point, it’s silly to keep fighting the tape and Nvidia’s growth. Nvidia’s fiscal Q3 earnings were something close to flawless. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.33 beat consensus expectations by 38 cents. Revenue, too, beat analyst expectations, rising 32% year-over-year. Gross profit expanded 50 bps year-over-year, and the company guided for a 60% non-GAAP figure in Q4, which simply is a huge number for a chipmaker. And this isn’t a case where the headline numbers are masking weakness within the business. A closer look shows strength across the board. Gaming revenue rose 25% year-over-year. Cryptocurrency demand has helped, but per the Q3 conference call sales actually fell quarter-over-quarter. Still, Nvidia’s strong growth in the category continued. In that area, NVDA news looks much better than that of AMD, whose cryptocurrency reliance was flagged by analysts coming out of its Q3 report. More broadly, the combination of revenue growth and gross margin strength suggests that AMD’s Vega isn’t taking much, if anything, in the way of share from Nvidia and that AMD isn’t able to undercut the company on pricing. Datacenter growth continued to be torrid, rising 109% year-over-year after 180% growth in the first half. That category now is on pace to generate over $2 billion in sales. The Volta GPU is seeing huge and quick adoption from all of the major cloud providers, including Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and even Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NASDAQ:BABA).

NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) is an interesting player in the Technology space, with a focus on Semiconductor – Specialized. The stock has been active on the tape, currently trading at $216.14, up from yesterday’s close by 5.27%. Given the stock’s recent action, it seemed like a good time to take a closer look at the company’s recent data. Fundamental Analysis It’s important to get a feel for how any stock is actually valued on the market based on its core numbers. NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) currently trades with a market capitalization of $129.04 Billion. That value represents a market adjusting for revenues that have been growing by 31.54 % on a quarterly year/year basis as of the company’s last quarterly report. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For NVDA, you can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $1.97 Billion over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to fall in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $1.14 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 66.95% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors. Technical Analysis We’ve taken a serious look at this stock from a fundamental perspective, but the tale of the tape may offer more hints about what lies under the surface. Looking at the stock’s movement on the chart, NVIDIA Corporation recorded a 52-week high of $212.90. It is now trading -3.24% off that level. The stock is trading $187.92 its 50-day moving average by -28.22%. The stock carved out a 52-week low down at $66.76. In recent action, NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) has made a move of +11.07% over the past month, which has come on weak relative transaction volume. Over the trailing year, the stock is underperforming the S&P 500 by 19.43, and it’s gotten there by action that has been more volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. In terms of the mechanics underlying that movement, traders will want to note that the stock is trading on a float of 2.23% with $573.18 Million sitting short, betting on future declines. That suggests something of the likelihood of a short squeeze in shares of NVDA.

Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) trades at $60.4 having a market capitalization of $33.18 billion. TGT stock price lost -15.35% over the past year, yielding a negative weighted alpha of -13.3 percent. A weighted alpha below 0 suggest additional declines. Therefore, there is certainly still some pain for investors who want to avoid this falling stock.  Weighted Alpha is used to calculate how much a share has gone up or down over a certain period, normally a year. In general, more thrust is placed on most recent actions by assigning higher weights to it than those assigned to past movements. This assists to give a return figure that has a stronger focus on the most current period and is thus a better measure for short-term analysis. This technique is highly famous among technical analysts. If the stock is up it will have a positively weighted alpha. If the stock price is unchanged its weighted alpha will be smaller. A stock price loss will yield a negatively weighted alpha.  Support is likely to come between $59.72 a share to $59.03 a share level. However, if the TGT shares go below $59.03 then it would indicate a much weaker market for the company. In that case, its shares would mark a 2.27% decline from the most recent price. The typical day in the last two weeks has seen about a 3.18% volatility. The average volume for Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) has been 6.57 million shares per day over the past 30 days. TGT has a 1-week performance of 1.87%. TGT price is down nearly -31.34% from its 52-week high price of $79.33 a share but is up about 19.6% from its 52-week low price of $48.56 a share.  NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has accumulated 1.87% over the course of one week. It seems that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) might see weakness given an ABR of 3 or Sell rating. Analysts, on average, seem bearish as they suggest NVDA is worth $-38.19 less, giving a target price of $174.44 a share. TGT share have plunged by -16.38% in percentage terms since the start of the year – and retreated -0.74% in the last month. Volume in the last session has decreased compared with TGT’s average trading volume. We think the decreased volume is representative of sellers as it has displayed in many other cases.  NVDA’s Stochastic Oscillator (%D) is at 67.44%. Values of %D line that are above 80 indicate that the security is overbought; prices could well fall in the near future. And the values below 20 that it is oversold indicate prices could very well bounce upwards. The Stochastic Oscillator is a powerful technical tool that is somewhat surprisingly easy to understand. In a basic sense, it is used by technicians to measure the speed or momentum of the price movement. It represents the location of the previous close relative to the price range over a set number of periods. This can be more easily understood, however, by pulling apart the two lines on the stochastic oscillator and explaining the simple underlying mathematical formulas. The first line is called the %K line, which analyzes the actual price movements in the shares and can be defined as: %K = (Current Close – Lowest Low)/(Highest High – Lowest Low) * 100. The second line, the %D line is simple a 3-day moving average of the %K line. There are three primary ways to read the Stochastic Oscillator in search of entry points, but traders should follow the %D line closely because that indicates major trends on the chart.  NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s latest quote $212.63 $-1 -1.62% will find technical support in $210.7 a share and a breakdown below this region would be a significantly bearish signal for NVIDIA Corporation traders. Any way you dice it, a dip below $208.78 a share would be very bad news for NVDA’s technical picture in the near-term. The $208.78 level represents at least another 1.81% downside for the stock from its current price. If NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares can stay above the price resistance around $215.86 a share, that could help propel NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) higher to the next line of resistance at $219.1 a share. The typical day in the last one month has seen about a 2.18% volatility. NVDA is down around 63.08% from its 12-month high of $78.5 notched on Nov 14, 2016 but is 137.31% above its highest point the past 12 months of $-79.33 a share.

U.S. stock futures are trading broadly lower this morning, as Wall Street worries about a deepening decline. Both the S&P 500 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average are coming off their first weekly losses in two months, as stocks retreat from lofty valuations. Washington remains front and center, as Congressional Republicans continue to flounder over a tax reform deal that has grown increasingly unpopular among constituents. Against this backdrop, Dow futures are down 0.34%, S&P 500 futures are down 0.28% and Nasdaq-100 futures have shed 0.39%. On the options front, puts gained in popularity on Friday, with about 16.5 million calls and 15.3 million puts crossing the tape. On the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio arrived at 0.66, with the 10-day moving average ticking higher to 0.64. As for Friday’s options activity, Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) drew heavy call volume in the wake of blowout third-quarter earnings. Meanwhile, JD.com Inc(ADR) (NASDAQ:JD), which also reported earnings this morning, and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA) were active ahead of Singles Day, the biggest shopping day of the year in China.  Nvidia said Friday morning that it earned $1.33 per share in the third quarter, blowing past the consensus estimate for 95 cents per share. Revenue came in at $2.64 billion, up 32% year-over-year and handily beating expectations for $2.37 billion. “We had a great quarter across all of our growth drivers,” said CEO Jensen Huang in the company’s press release. NVDA stock jumped more than 5% following the news, and options traders loaded up on calls while chasing the rally. Volume leapt to 484,000 contracts, nearly quadrupling the stock’s daily average. However, calls only made up 56% of the day’s take. This lack of enthusiasm from options traders is reflected in the November put/call open interest ratio, which now rests at 0.94 for NVDA. Despite the strong showing in the earnings confessional, options traders appear to be betting on a retreat for NVDA heading into Friday’s November options expiration.

Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and NVIDIA Corporation NVDA may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report. That is because NVIDIA is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for NVDA in this report. In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 95 cents per share for NVDA, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 94 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for NVDA, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.71% heading into earnings season. NVIDIA Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   NVIDIA Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | NVIDIA Corporation Quote Why is this Important? A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here). Given that NVDA has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for NVIDIA, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report. Wall Street’s Next Amazon  Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

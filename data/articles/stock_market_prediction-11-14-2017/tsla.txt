Tesla (Shutterstock photo) Even before the race for fully-autonomous cars — those that can actually drive themselves from point A to B without passenger intervention — have been won by the nation’s automakers, a battle is brewing to see who can produce the first driverless truck. Seen as highly disruptive to the global economy, which is worth an estimated $30 billion, Tesla (TSLA) wants to take lead in the commercial transport market. And on Thursday investors will get a chance to see how realistic the company’s ambition might be. CEO Elon Musk on Sunday tweeted that an unveiling will take place Thursday and will be broadcasted on the company’s site. The consummate sales agent, Musk, who had previously called the vehicle a "beast" and "unreal," on Sunday added that the sight of the electric semi truck "will blow your mind clear out of your skull and into an alternate dimension.”  Tesla, which has been putting self-driving technology into electric trucks, until recently has been only testing prototypes. Not much has been shared about the vehicle beyond soft mentions in April and September. Morgan Stanley analysts Ravi Shankar and Adam Jonas noted in September noted that Tesla could force other truck manufacturers to play catch up and come up with their own commercial truck plans. The industry that has also attracted interest from Alphabet’s (GOOG , GOOGL) Waymo and Uber, among others. But Musk, who has had to postpone the unveiling on multiple occasions, now believes the company is ready for primetime, calling the truck “seriously next level.” His confident words has re-ignited Tesla stock, which rose more than 4% Monday. Autonomous technology enthusiasts believe the long-haul trucking industry can benefit immensely from these trucks. Aside from the cost savings that can be realized in terms of fuel charges, self-driving electric trucks will also allow drivers to rest more, and thus attract more driving candidates. Tesla’s battery-powered rig is said to have a driving range of 200 to 300 miles on a single charge, according to Reuters. While that driving range would be much smaller than trucks operating on conventional diesels, which can travel up to 1,000 miles on a single tank of fuel, fleet operators such as Scott Perry, an executive at Miami-based Ryder, are willing to give Tesla time to develop longer-range technology. “I’m not going to count them out for having a strategy for longer distances or ranges, but right out of the gate I think that’s where they’ll start,” said Perry, according to Reuters. After disappointing the Street recently with not only reporting a wider-than-expected third-quarter loss, the company also pushed back its previous production targets for its highly-anticipated mass-market Model 3 vehicle, Musk has gotten investors excited again. Now, to the extent that the truck’s unveiling on Thursday’s will “blow my mind,” that remains to be seen. At the time of publication, Saintvilus held shares in Tesla.

Shares of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) have broken the bullish trend line following an earnings report that missed on nearly every metric. TSLA is still up a staggering 45% so far this year as faith and belief, not revenue or earnings, had taken shares to fresh all-time highs before the recent pullback. Faith and belief can only go so far, though, and I look for Tesla to have trouble heading appreciably higher for the foreseeable future. In my previous post on TSLA from Oct. 24, I felt that Tesla stock had topped out and was headed to $303, which proved to be the case. In a recent CNBC interview, noted TSLA bear Gabe Hoffman of Candens Capital highlights numerous issues surrounding the Model 3, autonomous driving and cash burn. He also says Tesla CEO Elon Musk makes Donald Trump look like an angel. While it certainly may be his short position in Tesla shares talking, many of the points made are absolutely valid. 
Click to Enlarge TSLA stock has suffered some serious damage from a technical perspective. Both the 50- and 200-day moving averages have been broken with conviction. A major head-and-shoulders double top has formed with the $320 neckline having been obliterated. The 200-day moving average of $320.42 also coincides with this major resistance area. TSLA is now down 20% from the all-time high near $390, which is indicative of a bear market. This all points to serious upside push back at the $320 level going forward for Tesla shares.

After having delayed the debut of its semitruck to focus on Model 3 hiccups and Puerto Rico’s energy needs, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) will unveil the electric truck Thursday. But it may not drive the sales investors want, according to Bernstein.  Bernstein analysts Toni Sacconaghi Jr. and David Vernon, who respectively cover the technology sector and logistics and transportation stocks, maintained a Market Perform rating on Tesla with a $265 price target. Expecting a Class 8 truck with a 300- to 450-mile range, Bernstein considers Tesla’s addressable market limited to less than half of the 940,000-unit-per-year semi market. Many drivers log 600 miles per day and may be disincentivized to delay deliveries with charging interruptions, the analysts said. A doubling of range would expand Tesla’s TAM to 100 percent, according to Bernstein.  Tesla may also face headwinds in relatively low fuel prices and uncertainty around charging rates, charge cycles and the role of autonomy, but its net present value may lend an edge, Sacconaghi and Vernon said.  Based on initial performance expectations, Bernstein projects a 3-percent market share over five years to contribute 7 percent of Tesla’s 2025 revenue forecasts. “On net, despite a potentially compelling value proposition, we do not see the Tesla Semi opportunity as a thesis changing initiative for the company, at least initially,” Sacconaghi and Vernon said, proposing a release date in mid-2019. “It is somewhat unclear why the company needs another major initiative (beyond Model 3, forthcoming Model Y, battery production, solar roofs and energy storage) on its already full plate.” Tesla is up 60 percent year-over-year but down 16 percent month-over-month. The firm posted a bottom-line quarterly miss Nov. 1 and has been dragged by Model 3 mishaps and EV tax credit uncertainties. At the time of publication, shares were trading up 1.3 percent at $307.

Tesla (NYSE:TSLA) Racial Bias Lawsuits ‘Tearing Down Tesla’ $TSLA Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) is being accused of allowing its California production plant to become a “hotbed for racist behavior.” A racial discrimination lawsuit, filed Monday in California Superior Court in Oakland, said Black employees were addressed by racial slurs and company management ignored their complaints. The lawsuit is the 3rd filed this year against Tesla alleging racial discrimination at its Fremont, California, factory. Monday’s lawsuit, filed by former Tesla employee Marcus Vaughn, said Mr. Vaughn was routinely called the “N-Word” by supervisors and coworkers after he began working at the factory in April. He says he complained in writing to human resources officials, but those complaints were never investigated. Mr. Vaughn says he was fired in October for “not having a positive attitude.” The lawsuit seeks class-action status and unspecified damages under California anti-discrimination law. The lawsuit is the latest in a growing number of lawsuits accusing Tesla of discrimination. In March, another Black employee alleging he was sexually harassed, racially harassed and racially discriminated against at the Fremont facility. A trio of former employees made similar claims in a lawsuit filed against the company in October.

https://qz.com/1117933/elon-musks-timeline-stays-true-to-form-as-tesla-tsla-posts-its-largest-quarterly-loss/

Tesla’s earnings numbers were not welcome news for investors. Today, the company said it delivered 26,137 cars during the third quarter, but only 222 of those were Model 3s. That’s far below the 1,500 Tesla was hoping to have delivered by this time. Overall, the company posted a loss of $619 million on sales of $2.98 billion. Tesla shares dropped by as much as 5.4% on the news in after-hours trading, before recovering slightly. Overall, the company’s stock is up by about 50% for the year. Tesla CEO Elon Musk had warned there would be bumps in the road as Tesla entered “production hell” for the Model 3, and in August warned of “production bottlenecks.” In a Nov. 1 letter to investors (pdf), Tesla clarified that the primary production constraint is the battery module assembly line in its Gigafactory 1 outside Reno, Nevada. Tesla said it was redesigning two parts of the battery assembly process, “key elements of which were done by manufacturing systems suppliers,” to streamline its automated manufacturing process. Musk says he’s camping out at the factory until the problems are resolved. In describing the struggle to get manufacturing back on track, he made an allusion to the nine circles of hell in Dante Alighieri’s Inferno. “We were in level nine, and we’re now in level eight and close to exiting level eight,” said Musk, “I thought we’d be more like level seven. I was really depressed three or four weeks ago.” Musk said that Tesla’s reliance on a small number of robotic stations to automate construction of the vehicle, rather than human workers, means that any problems on the line can slow assembly dramatically. The company’s fortunes are riding on the Model 3, which has a base price of $35,00. Tesla is betting its first mass-market car will elevate it to become the first automaker to join America’s famous “Big 3” in more than 50 years. Tesla has already surpassed all of them in market value at one time (GM put Tesla back in second place earlier this year), but the electric carmaker has yet to prove its staying power.  So far, it’s been a rough ride. Musk must coordinate a sprawling supply and production chain, including two factories where cars are assembled in Fremont and the Gigafactory where Model 3 battery packs and drive units are made. Tesla notes that its manufacturing process is more automated than most carmakers, and therefore takes longer to establish. The company said it plans to make 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week by about March 2018 (a quarter later than initially predicted) and then 10,000 units per week sometime after that. The company has about $3.5 billion in cash entering the fourth quarter to make it happen.

Tesla earnings (Shutterstock photo) Tesla (TSLA), which has ambitions of being more mainstream, will report third quarter fiscal 2017 earnings results after Wednesday's closing bell. But investors would feel much better if the luxury electric vehicle company had ambitions of being more profitable. Tesla shares have taken a massive beating over the past couple of weeks, falling as much as 18% from its all-time high of $386.99 reached in June to a recent low of $316.66 — the stock’s lowest level since early August. A combination of factors has impacted TSLA stock. But the biggest concern rests with Tesla’s money-making capabilities, particularly as it relates its highly-anticipated Model 3 sedan — the company’s first attempt at producing a mass market electric vehicle. Tesla reportedly spends some $80,000 to build each Model 3, which will retail for $35,000 — or about half the price of Tesla's next-cheapest car, the Model S. The company believes the lower price point would enable it to emerge from a niche market to better compete with Detroit heavyweights General Motors (GM) and Ford (F). On Wednesday the Street will want to get a sense of not only how realistic Tesla’s Model 3 delivery goals are, but also how much cash it will take to meet those goals. Earlier this month the company spooked investors when announcing that its third-quarter Model 3 delivery totals would be 220 vehicles. Though that marked a 4.5% increase year over year, it’s below the 1,260 vehicles analysts expected and well below the company’s year-end production targets of 20,000 Model 3s a month by December. On Friday analysts at Evercore downgraded TSLA stock from Buy to Neutral, advising their clients to be “more cautious” on Model 3 production. The Model 3 is “the most important piece of the Tesla investment story in coming quarters,” Evercore warned. In terms of overcoming production hiccups, which CEO Elon Musk recently described at “manufacturing hell,” Evercore noted, “We suspect that Tesla won’t have 100% visibility on the ramp until they hit more than 1,000 Model 3 units per week.” As such, the firm reduced its price target on TSLA stock to $312, from $330, implying a 3% downside to Friday’s closing price of $320.87. In the three months that ended September, Wall Street expects the Palo Alto, Calif.-based company to post a per-share loss of $2.29 on revenue of $2.94 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when the company lost 71 cents per share on $2.3 billion in revenue. For the full year, ending in December, the loss is expected to be $6.67 per share, compared to a loss of $2.87 a year ago, while full-year revenue of $11.84 billion would rise 69.2% year over year. All told, with the 1,000 Model 3 units per week benchmark expected to be reached toward the end of November, Tesla has a lot to prove Wednesday if it wants to keep its shares from driving in reverse. From my vantage point, however, these shares, which I now own, are not as risky as they were three months ago. I’ve said this before, Tesla’s main problem — if you can call it that — is that the company must overcome too much demand for its products. And that’s a business I want a piece of.

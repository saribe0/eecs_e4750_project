After splitting the games against Lake Superior State during their conference debut Nov. 3-4, the Seawolves went to Alabama to register a similar outcome versus the University of Alabama Huntsville at the Von Braun Center in Huntsville on Nov. 10-11. Senior forward Austin Azurdia continued his scoring streak by registering a goal during Friday’s match against UAH. Azurdia’s lone team goal of the match, at 7:06 in the second period, makes it four team-leading goals on his record. Junior forward Jeremiah Luedtke and senior forward Tad Kozun each recorded assists. The Alabama-Huntsville’s Chargers were led by Brennan Saulnier, who scored twice, in the 5-1 win over the Seawolves. Saulnier scored at 2:18 of the first period with a power-play and added another goal at 4:52 of the second period. Christian Rajic scored another goal for UAH at 10:30 of the second period followed by his teammate Levi Wunder at 16:49. Madison Dunn sealed the win for UAH with his empty-net goal at 18.08. Overall, the Chargers outshot UAA 40-17. During his 100th game for the Seawolves, senior goaltender Olivier Mantha registered 35 saves versus UAH’s goaltender’s 16 saves. “We struggled to find our rhythm and our opponents were there from the start,” David Trinkberger, sophomore defenseman, said. “The long drive and entire week cost us a lot energy and you could feel it. Overall, we had a hard time to play our best and Alabama-Huntsville won rightfully.” After their upset on Friday, the Seawolves returned to the ice on Saturday with a new tactic. In front of 3,072 attendees, the team scored three power-play goals in the second period. With an assist from Jonah Renouf, Nicolas Erb-Ekholm was able to respond to UAH’s first goal at 14:03 of the first period — producing a 1-1 tie. Erb-Ekholm’s goal was followed by Azurdia’s power-play goal at 17:57, assisted by Renouf as well as freshman forward Joe Sofo. Azurdia’s goal further extended his scoring streak to a team-leading five goals. Renouf registered his third assist of the night during Kozun’s power-play goal at 19:53. “The goal for today was to be there from the start of the game,” Trinkberger said. “We accomplished that relatively well and headed into the last period with a 3-1 lead.” Josh Kestner of UAH registered his second goal of the night at 4:36 of the third period, followed by Connor Merkley’s goal during the final minute of the period. Alabama-Huntsville pulled their goalie for a six-on-four advantage to secure the 3-3 tie. Luedtke’s goal in combination with Olivier Mantha’s saves during the shootout secured the win for the Seawolves. Overall, Mantha registered another 35 saves that night. “The Chargers were able to tie with us in the last minute of the third period, which resulted in overtime,” Trinkberger said. “Both teams had good chances, but the shootout brought the final decision. Our win of the shootout secured the tie and gave us an extra point in the WCHA standings.” UAA eared five points in its four WCHA games of the season and is currently tied for last place in the 10-team league with UAF and Lake Superior State who have played two more WCHA games than UAA. The Seawolves will
return to the Sullivan Arena on Nov. 17-18 to host a match
against WCHA rival Michigan Technological University. Michigan Tech currently

 KORS UAA  Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Under Armour, Inc. (UAA  -  Free Report)	, which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further confirms weakness in UAA.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen 19 estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from 37 cents a share a month ago to its current level of 21 cents.Also, for the current quarter, Under Armour has seen 17 downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 2 cents a share from 21 cents over the past 30 days.   The stock has also seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 24.4% in the past month.

     Welcome to the sixth episode of Full-Court Finance, a podcast from Zacks Investment Research focused on the intersection of sports, business, and the stock market. On this week's episode, we take an in-depth look at Under Armour's UAA  climb from startup to multibillion-dollar sports apparel powerhouse, and why its fortunes changed so quickly. Shares of Under Armour have fallen off a cliff in 2017, and Kevin Plank's company recently posted its first quarterly sales decline since going public more than a decade ago. The reasons behind Under Armour's third-quarter slump range from shifting domestic shopping habits, to declining sales at sports retailers such as Foot Locker FL  and Dick's Sporting Goods DKS  , as well as consumers' newfound love for athleisure. On top of a need to bolster direct-to-consumer sales and add more non-competitive apparel options, it seems that having stars such as Tom Brady and Steph Curry on its roster, and sponsoring college powerhouses like UCLA and Notre Dame, has not been enough to propel Under Armour to the heights many predicted. Under Armour also faces increased competition from Adidas ADDYY  in North America, while the company still struggles to compete with Nike NKE  in nearly every business segment. However, the company's recent downturn has forced Under Armour to make some changes-that investors should take note of-in order to get back on track. Make sure you listen to the entire episode of Full-Court Finance if you want to find out more about Under Armour's recent woes and what the sports apparel company might do to turn things around going forward.

 ATHM TTD ACXM ORCL  The Trade Desk Inc. (TTD  -  Free Report)	 reported third-quarter 2017 earnings of 35 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9 cents. Moreover, the figure improved 45.8% from the year-ago quarter.Total revenues were $79.4 million, up 50% from the year-ago quarter. The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $77 million. The strong growth reflects improving contribution from mobile (In-App, Video and Web), which accounted for 40% of total customer spending.Based on the solid results, management raised 2017 guidance, which however, failed to appease investors. Shares have declined more than 18.4% in the last two trading sessions.We believe that the downside reflects management’s cautious approach regarding lower spending from some large advertisers. However, Trade Desk noted that the advertisers have become selective in spending their ad-dollars. Their growing preference for programmatic advertising bodes well for the company in the long run.      The Trade Desk Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | The Trade Desk Inc. Quote   Nonetheless, the selectiveness can delay spending, which doesn’t augur well for Trade Desk in the near term.Additionally, some companies in the consumer packaged goods (CPG) and retail industries are reducing their advertising budgets to relieve margin pressure. This doesn’t bode well for Trade Desk in the near term.Further, the company stated that events like the bankruptcy of Toys “R” Us does affect the growth trajectory (although in small amount) in the near term.Nevertheless, we note that the stock has returned 74.9% year to date, substantially outperforming the 23.9% rally of the Internet Services industry.   Quarter DetailsOmni-channel solutions continue to be the bread and butter segment for Trade Desk as the industry keeps gradually shifting to transparency and programmatic buying. On a year-over-year basis, Mobile in-app, Mobile video and Connected TV improved 77%, 140% and 159%, respectively.Native spending was very strong in the reported quarter, surpassing the level attained through 2016. Customer retention rate was 95% in the reported quarter.Region-wise, Germany, the U.K. and Southeast Asia grew 131%, 82% and 123% on a year-over-year basis, respectively. Seoul surged 260%, while Singapore grew 123% from the year-ago quarter.Adjusted EBITDA surged 47.3% year over year to $24.4 million, driven by higher revenues.Reported operating expenses, as percentage of revenues, surged 520 basis points (bps) to 76.8% in the quarter. The upside can be attributed to higher technology and development expenses that soared 280 bps from the year-ago quarter. Moreover, platform operations expenses surged 220 bps. Further, general & administrative (G&A) expenses increased 170 bps.These were partially offset by a 150-bps decline in sales & marketing (S&M) expenses.As a result, reported operating margin contracted 520 bps from the year-ago quarter to 23.2%.GuidanceFor fourth-quarter 2017, Trade Desk anticipates revenues of $101 million and adjusted EBITDA of $34 million.Trade Desk currently anticipates revenues at $306 million, up from the previous guidance of $303 million, for 2017. Management expects adjusted EBITDA to be $90 million, up from $88 million.For 2018, Trade Desk expects spend in connected TV to increase by more than 100%.Moreover, international growth is anticipated at approximately double the U.S. business. Management expects footprint to expand, particularly in China.Further, the amount of third-party data usage is expected to increase in 2018. Management believes that partnerships with companies like Oracle Corporation (ORCL  -  Free Report)	, Acxiom Corporation (ACXM  -  Free Report)	, Lotame and others will drive growth next year.Zacks Rank & Key PickTrade Desk carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Autohome Inc. (ATHM  -  Free Report)	, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is a stock worth watching in the same sector. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Long-term earnings growth for Autohome is currently pegged at 18.8%.

The UAA volleyball team, who currently rank fourth in the Great Northwest Athletic Conference, won two back-to-back games over Nov. 9 – 11 to extend their season wins to a total of 18. Nov. 9 took off with a match between the Seawolves and Western Oregon. The game proved to be exceptionally successful for for junior outside hitters Chrisalyn Johnson and Leah Swiss, as well as sophomore middle blocker Vanessa Hayes, their efforts that were specifically noticed by Head Coach Chris Green. “That was far from our best effort, but I also give Western Oregon a lot of credit for playing great defense and making things hard for us, luckily some of our veterans stepped up at key points in the match enough to get us the win,” Green said. The Seawolves took over set one with an exceptionally large lead early on, with an eleven point difference at one time. Western Oregon eventually caught up and scored 6 points in a row to manage a tie at 22-22, but eventually finished off the set only 2 points short of a win. Swiss and Hayes took the majority of the credit for securing the win of set one, helping accumulate the 15 kills by the end of the se. Again, the second set proved to be successful for the Seawolves by starting off with a dramatic lead in the beginning. UAA managed to get to 14-6, an eight point lead, before Western Oregon rallied again to catch up. The Seawolves finished off the set at 25-21, with Western Oregon barely behind. The offensive advantages seen in set one and two were diminished in set three when the Seawolves only managed 9 kills and were put temporarily behind Western Oregon. Although they started out at a 9-6 lead, they soon fell behind until a tie resulted at 22-22. Despite the decline in offensive skill near the end of the game, the Seawolves earned their 10th straight win against Western Oregon. At the end of the night, Johnson finished with an impressive 12 kills and 15 digs, while Hayes accumulated nine kills. On top of that, freshman setter Casey Davenport managed 28 assists while libero Keala Kaio-Perez and Swiss tied with 21 digs each. Swiss’s addition of 9 kills on Nov. 9 put her over 1,100 career kills, ranking her as sixth on the all-time UAA list. In addition, Swiss also pushed her way into No. 2 on the UAA all-time list for career digs. Saturday, Nov. 11, proved to be a night similar the Seawolves’ battle against Western Oregon. UAA finished the night off with a 3-0 (25-16, 25-23, 25-14) win over Concordia-Portland. In contrast to Thursday’s game, Green was much more satisfied with the performance versus Concordia. “I was pleased with our play today, especially in the first and third sets. Offensively, we looked like a team that deserves another chance at an NCAA Tournament berth, but it was our defense that really made the difference in that close second set,” Green said. Set one started off with ties on four different occasions between the Seawolves and Concordia, but with a tie of 9-9, UAA took off with a 7 point rally to give them a significant lead, resulting in winning the set with a 9 point lead. That ease of winning didn’t seem to translate into the second set when Concordia only trailed by UAA by two points at the end. Although the Seawolves started with a quick 4 points back-to-back and an eventual seven point rally to push them back into the lead at 21-19, Concordia’s Lindsey Dorsey managed to propel her team closer to a win. It was a final kill by Johnson that let the Seawolves come out on top. In contrast, the Seawolves finished off the third and final set with an 11 point lead win. UAA peaked near the beginning with a 7 point rally, 6 of them assisted by Hayes. With their accumulation of points interspersed throughout the rest of the set, UAA experienced one final 4 point rally before ultimately winning at 25-14. The Seawolves finished off their night with a 3-0 win over Concordia with significant contributions from Johnson, Swiss, Kaio-Perez and Davenport. Johnson far surpassed athletes from both teams with a high of 15 kills for the night, in addition, defensively she made 8 digs for the night. However, Kaio-Perez took the title for the most digs between both teams finishing off with a total accumulation of 19 digs. Swiss was not far behind Kaio-Perez defense-wise, making 16 digs for the night in addition to accumulating 10 kills. Swiss now sits in the top-15 for UAA’s all-time career digs list, with a total of 963. Davenport, made a match total of 35 assists, 7 more than Concordia’s setter. UAA only made 5, 6, and 2 errors per set in contrast to Concordia’s 8, 5 and 5, respectively in each set. The Seawolves return back to the Alaska Airlines Center to compete against Alaska Fairbanks on Nov. 14 and Montana State Billings on Nov. 16. These are the final regular season games before UAA takes off to play in the NCAA Div. II West Regional Championships over the weekend of Nov. 30 – Dec. 2.

 Jeremiah Luedtke and Olivier Mantha came through in a shootout for the UAA hockey team Saturday in Huntsville, Alabama.  The game will go down as a 3-3 tie in the Western Collegiate Hockey Association, but the Seawolves picked up two points in the standings by winning the shootout.  Luedtke buried UAA's first attempt in the sudden-death shootout and Mantha stopped Huntville's only effort. Both teams picked up one point for the tie, and the Seawolves grabbed an extra point for the shootout win.  UAA scored three unanswered goals in the second period and was one second away from winning in regulation when the Chargers, skating with a 6-on-4 advantage, tied it as the buzzer sounded.  The teams played through two scoreless overtime periods at the Von Braun Center to set up the shootout.  Mantha finished with 35 saves and Nicolas Erb-Ekholm, Austin Azurdia and Tad Kozun provided goals in regulation for the Seawolves.  Azurdia extended his goal-scoring streak to three games with his team-high fifth goal of the season.  Jonah Renouf assisted on all three UAA goals and was among seven Seawolves to register points.  A night after being outshot 40-17 in a 5-1 loss to the Chargers, the Seawolves doubled their shots on goal. They fired 34 shots to Huntsville's 38.  All six regulation goals were scored on the power play. The second period was marred by penalties – the teams combined for 33 penalty minutes on 10 penalties.  The shootout victory gives UAA five points in four WCHA games. The Seawolves are tied for last place in the 10-team league with UAF and Lake Superior State, which have both played two more WCHA games than UAA.  UAA (1-7-2 overall, 1-2-1 WCHA) is two points out of sixth place, which is shared by Ferris State and the Chargers (3-6-1, 2-1-1). It's three points behind fifth-place Bemidji State, which has played six games.  The Seawolves return to Sullivan Arena this week for a two-game series against third-place Michigan Tech.

 When the Seawolves needed a spark to close out Thursday's volleyball match against Western Oregon, outside hitter Leah Swiss answered the call.  The junior hammered two straight kills and provided a solo block on match point to seal UAA's 25-23, 25-21, 25-22 sweep of the Wolves at the Alaska Airlines Center.  The Seawolves (17-9, 12-5 Great Northwest Athletic Conference) received 12 kills and 15 digs from Junior outside hitter Chrisalyn Johnson for her 10th double-double of the season, and Swiss added nine kills, a career-high 21 digs, three aces and two blocks.  UAA jumped out to big leads in the first two sets only to have Western Oregon (6-18, 2-15) fight back each time in a match that was closer than a sweep suggests.  In the first set, UAA led 5-6 before the Wolves began chipping away. Three straight Western Oregon kills made it 22-22, and Swiss was blocked by Leila Holt to give the Wolves a 23-22 lead. Swiss responded with a kill of her own and Hayes smacked back-to-back kills to clinch the set.  After leading 14-6 in the second, UAA saw its lead sliced to 20-18 on a kill from Western Oregon's Katherine Huntington. But the Seawolves answered with a 3-0 run — highlighted by a combo block from Vanessa Hayes and Anais Vargas — to stem the tide and hold on, 25-21.  The third set was the closest with neither team leading by more than three points the whole way. The match was tied at 22-22 before Swiss' back-to-back kills and solo block ended the match.  "That was far from our best effort, but I also give Western Oregon a lot of credit for playing great defense and making things hard for us," UAA coach Chris Green said in a press release. "Luckily some of our veterans stepped up at key points in the match enough to get us the win."  The Wolves were led by outside hitter Alisha Bettinson (15 kills), libero Libbie Hoene (22 digs) and outside hitter Sierra Stultz (5 aces), but they were outhit .173 to .093.  Heading into the week, Green said UAA will likely need to win out to have a shot at the West Region tournament.  The Seawolves have three matches remaining, all at the Alaska Airlines Center, with a 1:30 p.m., Saturday showdown against Concordia next on tap.

Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) is an interesting player in the Services space, with a focus on Discount, Variety Stores. The stock has been active on the tape, currently trading at $90.92, up from yesterday’s close by 0.69%. Given the stock’s recent action, it seemed like a good time to take a closer look at the company’s recent data. Fundamental Analysis No amount of research is complete without a bird’s eye view of the financial data. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) currently trades with a market capitalization of $269.74 Billion. That value represents a market adjusting for revenues that have been growing by 2.07 % on a quarterly year/year basis as of the company’s last quarterly report. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For WMT, the company currently has $6.47 Billion of cash on the books, which is offset by $7.17 Billion current liabilities. You can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $17.54 Billion over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to grow in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $0.97 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 32.52% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors. Technical Analysis As most professionals know, technical analysis can offer critical insights into what smart money and insiders think about a stock’s prospects going forward. Looking at the stock’s movement on the chart, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. recorded a 52-week high of $90.57. It is now trading -0.35000000000001% off that level. The stock is trading $83.45 its 50-day moving average by -7.47%. The stock carved out a 52-week low down at $65.28. In recent action, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) has made a move of +4.96% over the past month, which has come on weak relative transaction volume. Over the trailing year, the stock is underperforming the S&P 500 by 19.43, and it’s gotten there by action that has been less volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. In terms of the mechanics underlying that movement, traders will want to note that the stock is trading on a float of 3.12% with $1.41 Billion sitting short, betting on future declines. That suggests something of the likelihood of a short squeeze in shares of WMT.

http://www.nasdaq.com/article/interesting-january-2020-stock-options-for-wmt-cm876444

Consistently, one of the more popular stocks people enter into their stock options watchlist  at Stock Options Channel is Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (Symbol: WMT). So this week we highlight one interesting put contract, and one interesting call contract, from the January 2020 expiration for WMT. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting, is at the $75 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $3.45. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 4.6% return against the $75 commitment, or a 2.1% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost  ).      Selling a put does not give an investor access to WMT's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. So unless Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. sees its shares decline 18.4% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $71.55 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $3.45 from $75), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 2.1% annualized rate of return. Turning to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the January 2020 expiration, for shareholders of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.

Selling the covered call at the $105 strike and collecting the premium based on the $4.20 bid, annualizes to an additional 2.1% rate of return against the current stock price (this is what we at Stock Options Channel refer to as the YieldBoost  ), for a total of 4.3% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $105 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but WMT shares would have to advance 14.2% from current levels for that to occur, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 18.8% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.makeArticleAd();    The chart below shows the trailing twelve month trading history for Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., highlighting in green where the $75 strike is located relative to that history, and highlighting the $105 strike in red:       The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2020 put or call options highlighted in this article deliver a rate of return that represents good reward for the risks.

Investors in Facebook Inc (Symbol: FB) saw new options become available today, for the January 2020 expiration. One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 795 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the FB options chain for the new January 2020 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.    The put contract at the $175.00 strike price has a current bid of $23.55. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $175.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $151.45 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of FB, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $178.36/share today. Because the $175.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 62%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 13.46% return on the cash commitment, or 6.18% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost  .  makeArticleAd();  Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Facebook Inc, and highlighting in green where the $175.00 strike is located relative to that history:       Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $195.00 strike price has a current bid of $25.80. If an investor was to purchase shares of FB stock at the current price level of $178.36/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a "covered call," they are committing to sell the stock at $195.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 23.79% if the stock gets called away at the January 2020 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if FB shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Facebook Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing FB's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $195.00 strike highlighted in red:    Considering the fact that the $195.00 strike represents an approximate 9% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 47%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 14.47% boost of extra return to the investor, or 6.64% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost  .    The implied volatility in the put contract example is 27%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 30%. Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $178.36) to be 17%.

Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT) Heffx Trading Outlook Overall, the bias in prices is: Upwards. Short term: Prices are moving. Intermediate term: Prices are trending. Note: this chart shows extraordinary price action to the upside. By the way, prices are vulnerable to a correction towards 84.52. The projected upper bound is: 93.70. The projected lower bound is: 88.79. The projected closing price is: 91.24.  Candlesticks A black body occurred (because prices closed lower than they opened).
During the past 10 bars, there have been 8 white candles and 2 black candles for a net of 6 white candles. During the past 50 bars, there have been 32 white candles and 18 black candles for a net of 14 white candles. A long upper shadow occurred. This is typically a bearish signal (particularly when it occurs near a high price level, at resistance level, or when the security is overbought). A spinning top occurred (a spinning top is a candle with a small real body). Spinning tops identify a session in which there is little price action (as defined by the difference between the open and the close). During a rally or near new highs, a spinning top can be a sign that prices are losing momentum and the bulls may be in trouble. Momentum Indicators Momentum is a general term used to describe the speed at which prices move over a given time period. Generally, changes in momentum tend to lead to changes in prices. This expert shows the current values of four popular momentum indicators. Stochastic Oscillator One method of interpreting the Stochastic Oscillator is looking for overbought areas (above 80) and oversold areas (below 20). The Stochastic Oscillator is 78.1954. This is not an overbought or oversold reading. The last signal was a sell 0 period(s) ago. Relative Strength Index (RSI) The RSI shows overbought (above 70) and oversold (below 30) areas. The current value of the RSI is 73.15. This is where it usually tops. The RSI usually forms tops and bottoms before the underlying security. A buy or sell signal is generated when the RSI moves out of an overbought/oversold area. The last signal was a sell 5 period(s) ago. Commodity Channel Index (CCI) The CCI shows overbought (above 100) and oversold (below -100) areas. The current value of the CCI is 153.This is an overbought reading. However, a signal isn’t generated until the indicator crosses below 100. The last signal was a sell 4 period(s) ago. MACD The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence indicator (MACD) gives signals when it crosses its 9 period signal line. The last signal was a buy 1 period(s) ago.

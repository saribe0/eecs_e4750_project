Consistently, one of the more popular stocks people enter into their stock options watchlist  at Stock Options Channel is Exxon Mobil Corp (Symbol: XOM). So this week we highlight one interesting put contract, and one interesting call contract, from the January 2020 expiration for XOM. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting, is at the $65 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $2.40. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 3.7% return against the $65 commitment, or a 1.7% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost  ).      Selling a put does not give an investor access to XOM's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. So unless Exxon Mobil Corp sees its shares decline 21.6% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $62.60 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $2.40 from $65), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 1.7% annualized rate of return. Turning to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the January 2020 expiration, for shareholders of Exxon Mobil Corp (Symbol: XOM) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 3.7% annualized dividend yield. Selling the covered call at the $92.50 strike and collecting the premium based on the $2.84 bid, annualizes to an additional 1.6% rate of return against the current stock price (this is what we at Stock Options Channel refer to as the YieldBoost  ), for a total of 5.3% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $92.50 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but XOM shares would have to advance 11.5% from current levels for that to happen, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 14.9% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.makeArticleAd();    The chart below shows the trailing twelve month trading history for Exxon Mobil Corp, highlighting in green where the $65 strike is located relative to that history, and highlighting the $92.50 strike in red:       The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2020 put or call options highlighted in this article deliver a rate of return that represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Exxon Mobil Corp (considering the last 252 trading day XOM historical stock prices  using closing values, as well as today's price of $82.93) to be 12%.    In mid-afternoon trading on Monday, the put volume among S&P 500 components was 922,980 contracts, with call volume at 1.60M, for a put:call ratio of 0.58 so far for the day. Compared to the long-term median put:call ratio of .65, that represents high call volume relative to puts; in other words, buyers are showing a preference for calls in  options trading  so far today.

Investors in Facebook Inc (Symbol: FB) saw new options become available today, for the January 2020 expiration. One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 795 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the FB options chain for the new January 2020 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.    The put contract at the $175.00 strike price has a current bid of $23.55. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $175.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $151.45 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of FB, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $178.36/share today. Because the $175.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 62%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 13.46% return on the cash commitment, or 6.18% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost  .  makeArticleAd();  Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Facebook Inc, and highlighting in green where the $175.00 strike is located relative to that history:       Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $195.00 strike price has a current bid of $25.80. If an investor was to purchase shares of FB stock at the current price level of $178.36/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a "covered call," they are committing to sell the stock at $195.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 23.79% if the stock gets called away at the January 2020 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if FB shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Facebook Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing FB's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $195.00 strike highlighted in red:    Considering the fact that the $195.00 strike represents an approximate 9% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 47%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 14.47% boost of extra return to the investor, or 6.64% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost  .    The implied volatility in the put contract example is 27%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 30%. Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $178.36) to be 17%.

https://economicsandmoney.com/2017/11/13/what-the-chart-means-for-exxon-mobil-corporation-xom-3/

Investors have been carefully witnessing the recent activity of Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stock. Many experts agree that the truth about a stock is best reflected in the way it moves on the chart. For this stock, the chart has a lot to say about future performance. How has the stock performed recently? Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) in the last month has increased +0.64%. Shares are now up over the past year, outperforming the broad market by -100% and underperformed a peer group of similar companies by -105%. After the latest session, which saw the stock close at a price of $82.94, XOM sits below its 52-week high. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has been trading in a bullish manner, based on the relative positions of the stock’s 20 and 200 day moving averages. Momentum indicators 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that XOM may be headed in the future. Fortunately, there is way to use the speed and magnitude of these price changes to predict future performance, thanks to what are known as momentum indicators. As momentum slows, it might be a sign that a support or resistance level has been reached, and that a trend is about to reverse. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for XOM is 54.25%, which suggests that the stock is not particularly expensive or cheap, and not predisposed to a reactive price movement based on this measure. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 65.02%, tells a similar story, and suggests that XOM currently trades in neutral territory. What do the trading volumes reveal? Volume patterns can also be useful for predicting future performance. When trading activity is abnormally high, it’s often a sign that the market feels particularly strong in one way or another about the future direction of a stock. Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) average trading volume of 8,697,780 during the past month is 20.41% below its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been less active than usual in the stock in recent times. What do the analysts think? XOM is currently undervalued by -1.26% relative to the average 1-year price target of $84.00 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 3.00, which implies that analysts are generally neutral in their outlook for XOM over the next year. How risky is the stock?  In order to put XOM’s recent price performance into context, we need to get a sense of how the stock moves in relation to the overall market. Beta, which measures a stock’s price volatility relative to the market, provides the cleanest measure of systematic risk for a stock. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has a beta of 0.82, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are less extreme than the market as a whole. XOM therefore has a below average level of market risk. During the past couple of weeks, XOM average daily volatility was 8.09%, which is 0.84 percentage points lower than the average volatility over the past 100 days.

Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) recently finished four wells in North Dakota’s Bakken shale region that extend sideways for three miles and is nearing four miles, and its horizontal wells in the Permian Basin are approaching two and a half miles, Barclays analyst Paul Cheng says after meeting with company executives. Cheng calls the breakthrough “a game changer that could potentially allow the company  to leap frog the competition in unit cost and return metrics." Although late to the U.S. shale revolution, XOM seems to be bringing breakthroughs it made in the frigid Russian  Far East a decade ago to its North American fields., Bloomberg says.

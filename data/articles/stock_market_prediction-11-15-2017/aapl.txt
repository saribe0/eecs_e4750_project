By all accounts, the iPhone X is doing well for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). And the one-two punch of the radically new iPhone X and the iPhone 8 is seeing enough iPhones moving off shelves to kick AAPL stock into record-high territory. But what about next year? Rumors are already flying about Apple’s plans to keep consumers buying new iPhones in 2018. The strategy seems to be going big, with a 6.5-inch iPhone X Plus and 6.1-inch iPhone 9 added to the lineup. At the end of August — before Apple had even unveiled the iPhone X — a report emerged from South Korea’s ETNews. Citing unnamed industry sources, the report claimed that Apple was working with Samsung on next-generation OLED displays in 5.85-inch and 6.48-inch sizes. That would equate to what would be announced in September as the iPhone X, but also a larger model even bigger than Samsung’s Galaxy Note 8: an iPhone X Plus. One of the more respected names in Apple predictions, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, just released a new research note which was picked up by MacRumors. In it, Kuo suggests Apple will launch a trio of new iPhones in 2018, all based on the general design of this years iPhone X. That means a notched display, and TrueDepth cameras across the lineup, with Face ID replacing Touch ID altogether. Naturally, there would be a second generation iPhone X. Currently priced at $999+ as Apple’s most expensive ever offering, the iPhone X would become the standard model. Those with even deeper pockets or the desire for the most screen real estate possible could opt for an iPhone X Plus, with a massive 6.5-inch OLED display. Where things get even more interesting are with Kuo’s prediction that Apple will also release a more budget-friendly ($649 – $749) 6.1-inch model that looks like the iPhone X, but uses a cheaper and lower resolution LCD display instead of OLED. While Kuo doesn’t come out and say it, this lower cost option could be the iPhone 9. With iPhone sales making up the lion’s share of Apple revenue (and subsequently driving AAPL stock), the company is always laser-focused on how to keep that train rolling. One thing Apple has undoubtedly noticed is that Samsung does very well with its Galaxy Note series phablets –the Galaxy Note 7 battery disaster notwithstanding. These super-sized smartphones sell particularly well in Asian markets, where a smartphone often replaces a PC for its owner. Despite having the largest display ever on an iPhone, some iPhone X owners have noticed it actually feels smaller. That’s because the 5.8-inches is based on a standard diagonal measurement. The iPhone X display is longer and narrower than ever and overall, the 5.5-inch iPhone 8 Plus actually has more screen real estate. With an iPhone X Plus at 6.5-inches, Apple could make a flagship iPhone with a display that truly feels huge, in a form factor about the same size as its current Plus models.

Kevin Lamarque/Reuters  Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway raised its stake in Apple by 3%, to 134 million outstanding shares, in the third quarter, a regulatory filing released Tuesday showed. The conglomerate owned about 2.6% of Apple shares as of September 30, the 13F filing for the quarter ended September 30 showed. That made Berkshire the fifth-largest owner of Apple's outstanding shares, according to Bloomberg data. Though Buffett famously avoids technology companies, Apple fits his investing philosophy. Besides being a strong consumer brand, the iPhone maker pays regular dividends and spends on buybacks. Apple has also traded at a lower price-to-earnings ratio than many of its peers. Berkshire Hathaway first invested in Apple in 2016 when it bought 10 million shares. Buffett said in August that he had never sold Apple shares and did not pay attention the calendar when deciding to buy. In Q3, Berkshire raised its stake in the agricultural-biotech company Monsanto by 10% and increased its holding in Synchrony Financial. The firm slashed its stake in IBM. "I don't value IBM the same way that I did six years ago when I started buying," Buffett told CNBC in May. Major investment firms, including hedge funds, are required to disclose their long positions in stocks every quarter. Because of a time delay, however, these positions may have changed or been closed by the time the filing is public.

With the iPhone X finally making its way into consumers' hands, is Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL)'s super-cycle upgrade what it was cracked up to be? UBS' Steven Milunovich maintains a Buy rating on Apple with a $190 price target. "This is the first time since the iPhone 6/6+ form factor where you get an iPhone that truly feels like a big step up," Ben Bajarin, director of consumer technology practice at Creative Strategies, told Milunovich. (See Milunovich's track record here.)  Bajarin was one of the first to receive an iPhone X, and his firm regularly conducts smartphone studies and research.  “The interest that we’re seeing around the iPhone X is because of the fact that it looks and feels like a whole new generation and era of iPhone. That’s really exciting for the market." A recent smartphone study conducted by Creative Strategies found that 30 percent of existing Android owners are intending to switch to an iPhone, with half of that number citing the iPhone X as the reason why they are switching, according to UBS.  With average selling prices continuing to trend upward, smartphone ownership is slowly lengthening as well. Similar to how people often spend more on PCs knowing that they are going to using them for several years, the same phenomenon is becoming true for the smartphone market, according to UBS.  Creative Strategies' Bajarin said: “Ownership is slowly lengthening in every market that we look at."  Customers view phones as investments and could spend two to three years with them, Bajarin said. They "want the best because they know how valuable it is to their life."  At first take, judging by demand and consumer response, it appears the iPhone X appears to live up to the hype. Apple shares are down 1 percent on Tuesday, trading at $171.95 at last check.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) is an interesting player in the Consumer Goods space, with a focus on Electronic Equipment. The stock has been active on the tape, currently trading at $173.97, down from yesterday’s close by -0.40%. Given the stock’s recent action, it seemed like a good time to take a closer look at the company’s recent data. Fundamental Analysis Does this stock stack up well when compared to its peers in the industry space? Let’s take a look. Apple Inc. (AAPL) currently trades with a market capitalization of $899.40 Billion. That value represents a market adjusting for revenues that have been growing by 12.22 % on a quarterly year/year basis as of the company’s last quarterly report. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For AAPL, the company currently has $20.29 Billion of cash on the books, which is offset by $18.47 Billion current liabilities. You can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $51.15 Billion over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to fall in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $3.77 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 63.09% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors. Technical Analysis As most professionals know, technical analysis can offer critical insights into what smart money and insiders think about a stock’s prospects going forward. Looking at the stock’s movement on the chart, Apple Inc. recorded a 52-week high of $176.24. It is now trading 2.27% off that level. The stock is trading $160.35 its 50-day moving average by -13.62%. The stock carved out a 52-week low down at $104.08. In recent action, Apple Inc. (AAPL) has made a move of +8.81% over the past month, which has come on Strong relative transaction volume. Over the trailing year, the stock is underperforming the S&P 500 by 19.32, and it’s gotten there by action that has been more volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. In terms of the mechanics underlying that movement, traders will want to note that the stock is trading on a float of 0.65% with $5.13 Billion sitting short, betting on future declines. That suggests something of the likelihood of a short squeeze in shares of AAPL.

Source: Shutterstock Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is slated to become the first trillion dollar public company and it won’t take much from here. It has a clientele base who are absolute fanatics about its products and they don’t mind over paying for it. I do have bones to pick. First is with the current leader. Tim Cook kept the AAPL stock train on the rails but that’s about it. Since Steve Job’s passing, it remains an iPhone company. Innovation has been lacking, except when it comes to the financial engineering aspect. Debt went from zero to $100 billion quickly. It does have a lot of cash, but just because rates are low doesn’t mean I should burden myself with debt. Especially when I am not putting it towards generating new growth. When Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) issues debt, it’s because it needs to enter new markets. The company just did it to buy Whole Foods. By now, you might be upset because I’m not worshiping at the Tim Cook altar, but this is nothing against AAPL stock. It is an awesome company and it has a rosy future. Therein lies my opportunity to go long today, even if it is near its all-time high. Being as high as ever is not the same as saying it’s expensive. From a valuation perspective, AAPL stock has a price-to-earnings ratio one third smaller than Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and half that of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). So there is no doubt that I am investing in value today. Technically, the story is a little different. Investors are uneasy at risking $175-per-share to buy a stock when it’s at an all time high. It is natural to think that there could be slightly better entry points in the near future.

 The top gainer with a security that increased in price during today’s trading was Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Apple Inc. had a higher price at the close than it did at the open. The company holds a market cap of 885.81B with a P/E of 18.65 indicating whether its share price properly reflects its performance. Fundamentalists and value investors are seeing the low ratio of 3.86 as more positive – demonstrating that the company has a great deal of revenue with a fair price. However, technicians believes that a higher ratio would indicate the likelihood of a constant augmentation of the company’s share price. Apple Inc.’s P/B is valued at 6.58 exhibiting the investor sentiment on the value of the stock to its actual value. A higher P/B ratio of Apple Inc. is signposting that the investors have either overvalued it , or that its accountants have undervalued it. The P/B figure is also providing some ideas on whether the shareholders are paying too much for what would be left if the company went bankrupt immediately – but to consider that the company ought to have a lower P/B value. As of now, the increased share price of Apple Inc. makes it a lucrative buy for investors. A change of -1.51% in the price clearly indicates a strong asset performance for the corporation, , bearing in mind the total returns from its investment and dividends or distributions obtained from the investment. The ROA of Apple Inc. is currently valued at 14.00% indicating how profitable the company is in regards to its total assets. The figure tells us what earnings were generated from invested capital of Apple Inc.. It gives investors a clue on how effective the company is in converting the money it has to invest into net income. Apple Inc.’s ROI is valued at 18.30% relatively measuring the profitability on the investment. It evidently points out how profitable and preferable it is for the investors. The company has a current ratio of 1.3 gauging towards its ability in paying short-term and long-term obligations. With the existing current ratio, Apple Inc. is more than equipped to confront its liabilities with its assets. Apple Inc. has a quick ratio of 1.2 measuring its ability to meet its short term obligations with its most liquid assets. The high quick ratio specifies its better liquidity position on the credit terms the company has negotiated from its suppliers. The EPS growth this year is at 10.80% demonstrating an EPS growth of 5.34% in the coming year. This defines the most likely future of the stock price of Apple Inc.. With this high EPSGR it is predicted that growth rate will rise faster as compared to its competitors in the same industry. As it upholds an amended rate with more EPSGR it is prone to be a good target. Apple Inc. NASDAQ : AAPL | Wednesday, November 15, 2017    Tags (NASDAQ:AAPL) AAPL Apple Inc.

Allergan plc (AGN) is an interesting player in the Healthcare space, with a focus on Drugs – Generic. The stock has been active on the tape, currently trading at $171.82, down from yesterday’s close by -1.49%. Given the stock’s recent action, it seemed like a good time to take a closer look at the company’s recent data. Fundamental Analysis It’s important to get a feel for how any stock is actually valued on the market based on its core numbers. Allergan plc (AGN) currently trades with a market capitalization of $57.41 Billion. That value represents a market adjusting for revenues that have been growing by 11.38 % on a quarterly year/year basis as of the company’s last quarterly report.

 The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For AGN, the company currently has $1.61 Billion of cash on the books, which is offset by $3.8 Billion current liabilities. You can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $3.44 Billion over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to fall in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $4.72 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 87.42% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors. Technical Analysis We’ve taken a serious look at this stock from a fundamental perspective, but the tale of the tape may offer more hints about what lies under the surface. Looking at the stock’s movement on the chart, Allergan plc recorded a 52-week high of $256.80. It is now trading 84.98% off that level. The stock is trading $199.10 its 50-day moving average by 27.28%. The stock carved out a 52-week low down at $169.61. In recent action, Allergan plc (AGN) has made a move of -13.13% over the past month, which has come on Strong relative transaction volume. Over the trailing year, the stock is underperforming the S&P 500 by 18.55, and it’s gotten there by action that has been more volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. In terms of the mechanics underlying that movement, traders will want to note that the stock is trading on a float of 2.36% with $331.78 Million sitting short, betting on future declines. That suggests something of the likelihood of a short squeeze in shares of AGN.

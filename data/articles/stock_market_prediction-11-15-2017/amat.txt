  Applied Materials, Inc.  AMAT  is set to report fiscal fourth-quarter 2017 results on Nov 16.  Last quarter, it delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.61%. The company's surprise history has been pretty impressive. It beat estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 2.66%. Notably, on a year-to-date basis, Applied Materials' shares have returned 74.7%, outperforming the industry  's gain of 67.5%.    Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.  Strong Demand for Applied's Services  The company has well-differentiated products and high market share, and is efficiently delivering key enabling technology to logic and foundry customers. Service is an important part of Applied's portfolio, which grew significantly in the last quarter. The Applied Global Services (AGS) segment increased 8.6% sequentially and 19.6% year over year. The figure is further expected to increase in the upcoming quarter, driven by improved device and yield performance. The Zacks Consensus estimate for the upcoming quarter for AGS is pegged at $812 million.  Strength in Display to Drive Revenues  The company has gained considerable success in expanding beyond semiconductors, particularly in display. New display technologies such as OLED are opening new market opportunities for Applied Materials. The available market opportunity is now more than 10 times that of the traditional LCD. In the last quarter, the Display segment was up 4.9% sequentially and 31.0% from the year-ago level. The segment is further expected to perform well driven by significant opportunities coming from investments in areas such as artificial intelligence, big data, cloud infrastructure, Internet of Things (IoT), virtual reality and smart vehicles. The Zacks Consensus estimate for the upcoming quarter for Display segment is pegged at $676 million. However, increasing competition, high fixed-cost structure and customer concentration remain major concerns, which could affect the results in the upcoming quarter.  What Our Model Suggests  According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP  . Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell) stocks are best avoided, especially if these have a negative Earnings ESP. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter  . Applied Materials has a Zacks Rank #2 but an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, a combination that does not suggest that the company is likely to beat.  Applied Materials, Inc.

Hedge fund managers may seem to be a dime a dozen, but not many of them have had a stock market rally named after them. Billionaire David Alan Tepper, founder and portfolio manager at Appaloosa Management L.P., is the exception, having inspired what’s been dubbed the Tepper Rally of 2010. Through his macro view of the financial markets, Tepper was able to predict not only the stock market rally but the catalysts behind it which ultimately proved to be the Fed’s stimulus. An alum of Goldman Sachs, Tepper and those around him have admitted he can be difficult to work with. Chalk it up to his ability to see what others can’t, which ultimately has given him billionaire status. Tepper has compared himself to the likes of Mother Teresa and has claimed the ability to save beleaguered stocks from falling further. In February 2009, his fund bought distressed financial stocks such as Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) when they were at their bottom. The sector quickly recovered later in the year and Tepper reportedly made $7 billion. This ultimately helped him become the top-earning hedge fund in 2009. Appaloosa currently oversees $17 billion in AUM and was as high as $19 billion three years ago. It's important to note that the decrease in AUM is mostly due to Tepper returning money to investors for six consecutive years. With David Tepper's impressive track record, let's take a closer look at his portfolio. On November 14, 2017, Tepper's firm Appaloosa LP filed their quarterly Form 13F regulatory filing. I reviewed the 13F filing to get a sneak peek at holdings in Appaloosa's massive portfolio. Portfolio Overview and Statistics Appaloosa's stock portfolio totals nearly $7.1 billion according to the latest filing. The list value of stock holdings is up 5.6% when compared to the last quarter. As a benchmark, the S&P 500 was up 3.9% over the same period. Appaloosa's QoQ Portfolio Turnover for the latest quarter was 18.1%, so the firm appears to trade a significant percent of its portfolio each quarter. Note, Quarter-over-Quarter Turnover (QoQ Turnover) measures the level of trading activity in a portfolio. In comparison Warren Buffett, who prefers to hold his investments for a long-term period, had a QoQ Turnover rate of 2.1% in the second quarter. I also used finbox.io to find Appaloosa's largest buys last quarter. Here's the list of biggest buys determined by comparing the last two filings: Since September 29th (which is when these positions are reflective), Micron Technology is up 15.3%, NRG Energy is up 13.5%, Apple is up 13.1%, Ally is up 6.4%, and Facebook is up 4.5%. These five positions have all easily outperformed the S&P 500's 2.3% return over the same period. Only two of the seven stocks Tepper has been buying have underperformed: Financial Select Sector SPDR (+0.9%) and Boston Scientific (-2.7%). Here's the list of biggest position reductions determined by comparing the last two filings: Since September 29th, Allergan is down -16.4%, iShares NASDAQ Biotechnology ETF is down -8.5%, Williams Partners is lower -6.9%, and PNC Financial is down -2.1%. These four stocks have all underperformed the S&P 500's 2.3% return over the same period. The only position Tepper has been selling that has outperformed is General Motors which is up 6.4% since September 29th. Overall, the stocks that Tepper has been adding have generally increased in value while the stocks he's selling have generally lost value. That crystal ball appears to be working well! As I've mentioned before, analyzing thousands of stocks listed on U.S. exchanges is likely impossible for smaller investors. That's why it is wise to leverage the resources from distinguished money managers, such as Tepper, in order to help narrow down a watch-list.

Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) stock flux has recently been causing stir among the investment community. Many experts agree that the truth about a stock is best reflected in the way it moves on the chart. For this stock, the chart has a lot to say about future performance. How has the stock performed recently? Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) in the last month has increased +4.49%. Shares are now up over the past year, outperforming the broad market by -100% and outperformed a peer group of similar companies by 156%. After the latest session, which saw the stock close at a price of $56.36, AMAT sits below its 52-week high. Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) has been trading in a bullish manner, based on the relative positions of the stock’s 20 and 200 day moving averages. Momentum indicators 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that AMAT may be headed in the future. Fortunately, there is way to use the speed and magnitude of these price changes to predict future performance, thanks to what are known as momentum indicators. As momentum slows, it might be a sign that a support or resistance level has been reached, and that a trend is about to reverse. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for AMAT is 62.77%, which suggests that the stock is not particularly expensive or cheap, and not predisposed to a reactive price movement based on this measure. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 71.39%, tells a different story, and suggests that AMAT currently trades in overbought territory. What do the trading volumes reveal? Volume patterns can also be useful for predicting future performance. When trading activity is abnormally high, it’s often a sign that the market feels particularly strong in one way or another about the future direction of a stock. Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT) average trading volume of 8,906,695 during the past month is 9.33% below its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been less active than usual in the stock in recent times. What do the analysts think? AMAT is currently undervalued by -5.56% relative to the average 1-year price target of $59.68 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 1.80, which implies that analysts are generally bullish in their outlook for AMAT over the next year. How risky is the stock?  When predicting the future performance for a stock, it’s also important to take into account risk. To do this, analysts often use a stock’s beta, which measures the stock’s volatility relative to the overall market. Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) has a beta of 1.84, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are more extreme than the market as a whole. AMAT therefore has a above average level of market risk. During the past couple of weeks, AMAT average daily volatility was 20.11%, which is 7.01 percentage points lower than the average volatility over the past 100 days.

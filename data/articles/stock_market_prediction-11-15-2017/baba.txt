Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA) has had an impressive run. BABA stock is up 112% so far this year, but I, like many analysts, don’t think the ride is over yet. As we draw closer to the beginning of 2018, it’s hard to imagine BABA stock price dropping. In fact, the firm looks poised to have a bumper 3rd quarter. There are many growth catalysts on the horizon for Alibaba, and that suggests that the firm’s share price will push above $200 within the next few months. Here’s a look at three reasons BABA stock has the potential to rise above $200 by the end of January: It’s impossible to mention Alibaba right now with out talking about Singles Day, a massive shopping holiday in China where people are encouraged to spend money on themselves. Think ‘Black Friday’ on steroids. Singles Day always takes place on November 11, and this year Alibaba did $25.3 billion in sales during the made-up holiday. To put that into perspective, Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) had its annual Prime Day sale and was estimated to have moved $1 billion worth of goods, and last year’s Black Friday weekend only totaled about $8 billion. If that doesn’t add some fire to BABA’s stock price, I’d be very surprised. Alibaba practically invented Singles Day and its massive success is a testament of BABA’s ability to influence Chinese consumers. It also is a sign that China’s middle class is ready to spend some if its disposable income, which is something I have questioned in the past. Perhaps the biggest reason to get excited about Singles Day is the second reason BABA stock is likely to climb in the months ahead- Ling Shou Tong, or “connect retail.” Alibaba founder Jack Ma has been looking to expand BABA’s reach through cloud computing and logistics businesses and Ling Shou Tong is his answer. Ahead of Singles Day, Alibaba made its way into about 600,000 convenience stores, or 10% of the total number of independent convenience stores in the country, by upgrading their computer systems and acting as a kind of inventory management system. BABA allows the stores to manage procurement and sales, but the company’s Ling Shou Tong app uses customer data to help the stores determine which goods to stock and how to display them. Alibaba then ships the goods itself to fill stores’ orders.

 The top gainer with a security that increased in price during today’s trading was Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA). Alibaba Group Holding Limited had a higher price at the close than it did at the open. The company holds a market cap of 462.4B with a P/E of 51.35 indicating whether its share price properly reflects its performance. Fundamentalists and value investors are seeing the low ratio of 15.57 as more positive – demonstrating that the company has a great deal of revenue with a fair price. However, technicians believes that a higher ratio would indicate the likelihood of a constant augmentation of the company’s share price. Alibaba Group Holding Limited’s P/B is valued at 9.56 exhibiting the investor sentiment on the value of the stock to its actual value. A higher P/B ratio of Alibaba Group Holding Limited is signposting that the investors have either overvalued it , or that its accountants have undervalued it. The P/B figure is also providing some ideas on whether the shareholders are paying too much for what would be left if the company went bankrupt immediately – but to consider that the company ought to have a lower P/B value. As of now, the increased share price of Alibaba Group Holding Limited makes it a lucrative buy for investors. A change of -1.49% in the price clearly indicates a strong asset performance for the corporation, , bearing in mind the total returns from its investment and dividends or distributions obtained from the investment. The ROA of Alibaba Group Holding Limited is currently valued at 11.50% indicating how profitable the company is in regards to its total assets. The figure tells us what earnings were generated from invested capital of Alibaba Group Holding Limited. It gives investors a clue on how effective the company is in converting the money it has to invest into net income. Alibaba Group Holding Limited’s ROI is valued at 8.70% relatively measuring the profitability on the investment. It evidently points out how profitable and preferable it is for the investors. The company has a current ratio of 1.7 gauging towards its ability in paying short-term and long-term obligations. With the existing current ratio, Alibaba Group Holding Limited is more than equipped to confront its liabilities with its assets. Alibaba Group Holding Limited has a quick ratio of 1.7 measuring its ability to meet its short term obligations with its most liquid assets. The high quick ratio specifies its better liquidity position on the credit terms the company has negotiated from its suppliers. The EPS growth this year is at -39.10% demonstrating an EPS growth of 30.42% in the coming year. This defines the most likely future of the stock price of Alibaba Group Holding Limited. With this high EPSGR it is predicted that growth rate will rise faster as compared to its competitors in the same industry. As it upholds an amended rate with more EPSGR it is prone to be a good target.

 AMZN JD BABA QCOM GE AVGO  Monday, November 13, 2017Early news to start the week ahead of today’s opening bell begins with a dividend cut to one of the U.S.'s biggest companies: General Electric (GE  -  Free Report)	 has announced it is slashing its dividend in half, to 12 cents per share. This comes as a surprise to much of the market, although under new leadership — CEO John Flannery replaced Jeff Immelt on August 1st of this year — we see number-crunchers at the company Thomas Edison once helped found seeing too much capital going out the door when it ought to be put to use internally.An investor meeting at GE commences at this hour to discuss this move, which had actually put GE shares in the green by roughly 1.5% this morning before reversing trend and sending the stock down 1.6%. Year to date, GE shares are down almost 33%. Also, guidance for full-year 2018 have been ratcheted down, from $1.16 per share previously to a range of $1.00-1.07 today.Singles Day OutperformsOver the weekend, while Americans celebrated Veterans Day (mostly by watching football and drinking beer), China procured the “single” largest shopping day in history: Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report)	 alone brought in $25.3 billion on Saturday, with other Chinese online merchants such as JD.com (JD  -  Free Report)	 now joining in the fun. Compare this with Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report)	 Prime Day, which most recently brought in a record amount of revenue for its 30-hour sale: $1 billion.What began as more or less a protest against commercial holidays like Valentine’s Day, “Singles Day,” which began in 2009, is now more broadly known the world over as the “Global Shopping Festival.” As this marketing bonanza continues to grow year after year, we also see some truly remarkable figures, such as 90% — NINETY PERCENT — of Singles Day purchases having been made via mobile. If this doesn’t inspire retailers to go strong into mobile sales from this point forward, they’re clearly just not paying attention.Markets Lower on Asia WeaknessIndexes in Asia overnight sold off, including in Japan and South Korea. We also see selling pressure on the British pound as Brexit processes make their way through the python. Calls for U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May to step down after just a year at 10 Downing Street — with the re-emergence of “fringier” characters on the British political scene like former Mayor of London Boris Johnson — now illustrate the possible reality of a “hard Brexit” analysts had been fearing since the surprise EU secession vote a year and a half ago.Japan’s sell-off continues from what looks essentially like a technical move, following multi-year highs in its market tapping out late last week. The Nikkei index fell by the largest amount since early April, without much to assign blame to but profit-taking and valuation correction. The Japanese yen is increasing in value against virtually al other major currencies, which may create market headwinds as Japanese products and services grow more expensive on the global market.Qualcomm Rejects BroadcomAs widely expected, Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report)	 has rejected rival chip-maker Broadcom’s (AVGO  -  Free Report)	 offer to buy the similarly-sized company for $70 per share. Qualcomm naturally considers the offer too low, and also cited present regulatory uncertainties as reasons for the thumbs-down to Broadcom. We await a follow-up move from Broadcom, but without any indication whether the company will make a more generous offer or simply let this go.Mark VickerySenior EditorToday's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

Shares of Jack Ma led Chinese eCommerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA) have had a stellar year with more than 110% gains in the year-to-date. The shareholders are a happy lot with the kind of run BABA stock has had this year coupled with the spectacular earnings performances of the Asian online retail behemoth. We have been bullish about Alibaba stock for some time and we still consider it to be a good long-term buy. However, Alibaba stock has failed to take off even after the strong singles day sales which jumped to $25.3 billion much higher than Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales. Of late BABA stock has come under pressure, losing momentum after the initial uptick post-earnings. If the Alibaba stock technical chart is something to go by, BABA stock could be under more pressure in the immediate near-term. Here is why.
 In the last trading session, Alibaba stock saw a bearish crossover with its Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator, which is a popular momentum indicator used by technical traders. The MACD line fell below the signal line to form a bearish crossover, which implies that the downward pressure could continue for the next few sessions. Alibaba stock has its next support level at its 20-day simple moving average (SMA), just a few cents away from the last close at 180.95. A breach of this support level could mean the downtrend could continue further. However, even in the case of the breach of support level at the 20-day SMA, one could expect the stock to bounce back from the 50-day SMA which has acted as a very strong support level for the whole of 2017. Smartphone chip giant QUALCOMM, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock is having its best run this year since the sell-off due to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and other lawsuits at the beginning of the year. Qualcomm stock is almost 30% up in November. The take over bid by another semiconductor company Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) has been the main driving force behind the reversal of fortunes for QCOM stock rather than a change in the fundamental story of the San Diego, California based company. Qualcomm board has rejected the $70 per share acquisition offer saying the bid is too low setting up for a proxy fight. The higher than usual volumes have been also vital for the stock'sustained uptrend. However, the upward surge in QCOM stock is beginning to cool off with the share price being almost flat over the past few days. The question now is, Can Qualcomm stock still climb higher from here? The answer to this could be partly found in the QCOM stock technical chart.   If one takes a look at the chart above, we could see that Qualcomm stock is set for bullish breakout pattern called the 'golden cross'. Investopedia defines this crossover as "a bullish breakout pattern formed from a crossover involving a security's short-term moving average (such as the 15-day moving average) breaking above its long-term moving average (such as 50-day moving average) or resistance level. As long-term indicators carry more weight, the golden cross indicates a bull market on the horizon and is reinforced by high trading volumes." In case of QCOM stock, the shorter term 50-day simple moving average (SMA) is all set to break above its long-term 200-day SMA, separated by just a few cents, which are also the most commonly used moving averages for 'golden cross'. Investors should also note that this is the first time in almost 18 months this bullish crossover is set to occur. And, the last time Qualcomm stock made 'golden cross', it set out on a rally. However, a word of caution for investors, the current Relative Strength Index (RSI) reading of 76.17, which is well above the commonly used overbought threshold of 70, suggests that the stock is in overbought territory, hinting that the upside could be limited. Though the Bollinger Bands indicator is not flashing an overbought signal and generally the combination of these two indicators is considered as a strong signal. The sell-off in alternative energy technology company Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG) doesn't seem to stop after its Q3 earnings release last week. Plug Power stock dropped another 5.8% yesterday and has lost more than 25% of its value after the earnings announcement. The Latham, New York-based company delivered a non-GAAP earnings loss of 4 cents, which was in-line with the analyst estimates on revenue of $61.43 million, bettering the expectations by $5.64 million. The revised full-year adjusted gross margin falling below the company's previous guidance of 8% to 12% also had not gone down well with the investors partially contributing to the sell-off. Now, if one take's a look at the PLUG stock technical chart, they would be rather disappointed as the downtrend is likely to continue for some time now going by the technical set up. As one can see in the chart above, Plug Power stock made a bearish crossover with its 100-day SMA in the last trading session. The stock lost a crucial support level at the 100-day SMA which has acted as a strong support level over the past few months. Earlier on Monday, PLUG stock had made a bearish MACD crossover, as the MACD line fell below the '0' line. With a string of bearish crossovers, the downhill run of Plug Power stock is likely to continue. A bottom may be still some distance away as the stock is not in the oversold zone as per both popular momentum indicators Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Bollinger Bands. Only the Bollinger Bands indicator is flashing an oversold signal as the share price breached the lower Bollinger band yesterday. However, the current RSI reading is at 37.58, well above the general oversold threshold measure of 30. So, PLUG stock is yet to bottom out. Looking for fundamentally strong tech stocks like Apple?

Source: Shutterstock Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) has been on fire over the past year, but you wouldn’t know it by the last few days. BAC stock price is down about 5% this week. Time to take profits and hit the road? Not so fast. Let’s take a look at three reasons to stay long BAC Stock. Whether they’re moving up rapidly or not, interest rates are at least moving higher. For years we were stuck at zero or near-zero rates, because the economy lacked oomph. Well, now we’ve got some oomph and this time it really feels sustainable. All of that has led to higher interest rates over the last 15 months. However, we’re still a ways away from “normal rates.” So they should continue to climb over the next few years. The Federal Reserve has been telegraphing that a December rate hike is on the table. That has since become the expectation. While the Fed would like to hike two to three more times in 2018, Wall Street isn’t overwhelmingly confident that will happen. We will see, but the trend is up. Why do rates matter for Bank of America? With one of the largest collections of customer deposits in the country, higher rates allows BAC to earn more money on those deposits. It’s essentially risk-free income. BAC isn’t the only winner, as JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C), Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE:WFC), and other banks benefit too. That brings us to our second point. While BAC stock price is up tremendously over the last 12 months, up 40%, it’s still reasonably priced. Trading with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 13.9 and a forward P/E ratio of 12.4, this is still a really cheap stock. Sales are forecast to grow 5.7% this year and just 3.7% in 2018. However, earnings are expected to grow about 20% in each of those years. Using its trailing P/E ratio and 2018 estimates, it’s not crazy to think BAC stock could trade at $33 to $35 by fiscal year-end 2018. That’s about 25% to 30% upside from current levels and even more if we get a pullback. In August, BAC upped its quarterly dividend to 12 cents per share, a 60% boost from its prior payout. That follows a 50% increase from the following year. Management is no slouch on the buyback, either. Alongside a dividend hike, the company approved a 140% year-over-year increase in the buyback program from $5 billion to $12 billion. This follows a collective $13 billion in buybacks from 2013-2015. Massive? No, not when you consider that BAC stock now sports a $265 billion market cap. But it’s not totally insignificant. No one will ever be like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), but that doesn’t mean buybacks aren’t worthwhile.

After staying quite for a long time Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) shares have recently been behaving interestingly to keep investors awake. Analysts often use price and volume data to predict future stock performance. In the case of BAC, the chart has some interesting things to say about where the stock might be headed. How has the stock performed recently? Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) in the last month has increased +2.63%. Shares are now up over the past year, outperforming the broad market by -100% and outperformed a peer group of similar companies by 225%. After the latest session, which saw the stock close at a price of $26.51, BAC sits below its 52-week high. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) has been trading in a bullish manner, based on the relative positions of the stock’s 20 and 200 day moving averages. Momentum indicators 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that BAC may be headed in the future. To do this, analysts often study the speed and magnitude of a stock’s price movements with what are known as momentum indicators. The logic is that as a stock’s momentum slows, it may be nearing key support or resistance levels and possibly the end of a current trend. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for BAC is 51.28%, which suggests that the stock is not particularly expensive or cheap, and not predisposed to a reactive price movement based on this measure. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 45.54%, tells a similar story, and suggests that BAC currently trades in neutral territory. What do the trading volumes reveal? Analysts use volume trends to assess the level of conviction behind a stock’s price changes. When volumes suddenly increase above normal levels, it can be a sign that investors feel very strongly in one way or the other about the future direction of a stock, or may even have access to inside information. Bank of America Corporation (BAC) average trading volume of 63,033,168 during the past month is 19.74% below its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been less active than usual in the stock in recent times. What do the analysts think? BAC is currently undervalued by -5.96% relative to the average 1-year price target of $28.19 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 2.10, which implies that analysts are generally neutral in their outlook for BAC over the next year. How risky is the stock?  Absolute price performance isn’t the only thing analysts consider when predicting future performance: volatility matters as well. Beta, which measures the stock’s volatility relative to the overall market, is a simple but effective metric for assessing risk. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) has a beta of 1.32, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are more extreme than the market as a whole. BAC therefore has a above average level of market risk. During the past couple of weeks, BAC average daily volatility was 15.87%, which is 2.85 percentage points lower than the average volatility over the past 100 days.

https://www.stocknewsgazette.com/2017/11/10/looking-at-the-big-picture-for-bank-of-america-corporation-bac-2/

Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)’s interesting series of developments are underway around the US stock market these days. Now trading with a market value of 276.80B, the company has a mix of catalysts and obstacles that spring from the nature of its operations. Everyone seems to have their own opinion of this stock. But what do the numbers really say? We think it’s a great time to take a fresh look. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) Fundamentals That Matter It’s generally a good idea to start with the most fundamental piece of the picture: the balance sheet. The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. The trend over time is important to note. In this case, the company’s debt has been growing. The company also has 2.28T in total assets, balanced by 2.01T in total liabilities, which should give you a sense of the viability of the company under any number of imagined business contexts. Bank of America Corporation (BAC) saw 27.51 billion in free cash flow last quarter, representing a quarterly net change in cash of 13.68 billion. Perhaps most importantly where cash movements are concerned, the company saw about 27.51 billion in net operating cash flow. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) Revenue Growth Potential As far as key trends that demonstrate something of the future investment potential of this stock, we need to take a closer look at the top line, first and foremost. Last quarter, the company saw 14.66 billion in total revenues. That represents a quarterly year/year change in revenues of 0.16 in sequential terms, the BAC saw sales decline by 0.04. But what about the bottom line? After all, that’s what really matters in the end. Bank of America Corporation (BAC) is intriguing when broken down to its core data. For shareholders, given the total diluted outstanding shares of 10.73 billion, this means overall earnings per share of 0.48. Note, this compares with a consensus analyst forecast of 0.47 in earnings per share for its next fiscal quarterly report. 
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Is Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) Valuation Attractive Looking ahead at valuations, according to the consensus, the next fiscal year is forecast to bring about 2.13 in total earnings per share. If we consider a median price to earnings ratio on the stock, that corresponds with a stock price of 12.91. However, one should always remember: the trends are more important than the forecasts. This continues to be an interesting story, and we look forward to updating it again soon on Bank of America Corporation.

Source: Shutterstock It’s reasonably safe to say that whatever lingering problems Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) had with the subprime mortgage meltdown from 2008 are not just in the past, they’re well in the past after lingering an unusually long time for this particular bank. Indeed, BofA has moved on to a whole new set of problems that nag owners of BAC stock, like dealing with soured loans to struggling energy companies and a merely so-so investment banking business. Even then though, there’s no denying Bank of America is finally offering the stability and predictability investors have been wanting for a long while now. It’s time to move deeper into the details, pinpointing exactly what’s working and not working for the megabank. And one simple chart can do the deed. Kudos to Bank of America for finally turning the corner 2015 and 2016. Earnings per share of BAC stock took a turn for the better in 2015, and 2016 is when we saw the top line start to edge higher. The progress is still a little uneven, but at least the progress is measurable. The follow-up question any savvy investor should be asking now: What is Bank of America doing well, and what is it doing poorly? It needs to do more of the former, and needs to fix the latter. As they say, read ’em and weep. 
Click to Enlarge For investors not familiar with BofA’s divisional breakdown, its Consumer & Business Banking arm caters to retail consumers, taking deposits, making mortgage loans, and helping customers open checking accounts. That unit is doing fine, revenue-wise and in terms of income. The company’s Global Banking business, which meets the basic banking needs of larger, institutional customers here and abroad (including investment banking services), is doing fine as well. Its Global Markets and Global Wealth and Investment Management divisions, on the other hand, have been persistently lackluster.

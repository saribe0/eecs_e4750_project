by Andrea Salcedo Q&As With Our Illinois Newsroom Sandhya Kambhampati, who came to ProPublica Illinois from Correctiv, an independent nonprofit newsroom in Berlin, enjoys sifting through datasets to find a story. But for her, data is more than “data points and numbers. It’s people who are getting affected.” In the sixth of a series of Q&As with ProPublica Illinois staffers, Kambhampati talked with ProPublica Emerging Reporter Andrea Salcedo. What inspired you to become a data reporter? I’ve always liked numbers and statistics. As a child, my dad played NPR in the car, we watched the nightly news and we watched “60 Minutes” on Sundays. I actually wanted to be a “60 Minutes” reporter when I was little. The reason I liked that type of reporting was because it was document-based. They had to sift through lots of data and find the story. I wanted to find a way to do that kind of investigative reporting. So when I got to college, I heard about this class being offered called CAR (computer-assisted reporting). I saw that it was a senior-level course and I thought, “That’s stupid. Why is it only senior level?” I thought, “OK. I’ve got to take this class.” I got into that class my sophomore year. That professor pretty much inspired me to continue on that path.  What are you interested in investigating with ProPublica Illinois? I’m interested in higher education data, taxes and transportation. I’d like to dig into the systems in Illinois that people don’t know much about and help put the data that’s recorded or not recorded on these systems into context. What are some underreported stories in Illinois that you wish would receive more coverage, especially after looking at so many datasets on a regular basis? In general, hate crimes are not very well reported. Statistics on them are really bad and the record keeping is not consistently kept across police agencies. How do you hope the stories that you help build at ProPublica Illinois will spark change? For me, the most important thing is to have people understand the systems that are at play in the world, especially here in Illinois. I really think it’s important for people to understand how the tax system works, how property assessments work or how hate crimes are recorded. To me, it’s rewarding when a person can understand the system and the flaws within the system. That’s a lot of the reporting ProPublica does. We find the good and bad parts of the system. How would you explain your job as a data reporter to the general reader? I take databases, spreadsheets or documents and put them into a spreadsheet or vice versa. I look at them — the broad picture. I chop them up into little pieces and analyze the data and I find the little examples that we can use in reporting. Eighty to 90 percent of my job is cleaning data, getting data out of poorly formatted spreadsheets and wrangling it into a database that’s clean and that we’re able to actually analyze. Once I’ve got data in that format, I’m able to ask questions and interview my data just like I would with a human source. Once I interview the data, I collect those results, I talk to sources, talk to experts and then go out and write my story or work with another reporter. I really want people to know that what I do is not some sort of wizardry. I want people to understand that the data often leads me to my sources, but it’s also the other way around, where sources lead me to datasets. That’s what I like the most about my job. That I’m able to work with numbers and I also get to work with people, which is the best of both worlds in my opinion. How do you use data in your regular life? I organize my life with spreadsheets because why not? I actually have several spreadsheets for general life usage. I have a spreadsheet of all the things that I have in my apartment for when I move. I have a list of all the places I’ve visited, a list of all the flights I’ve taken and a general packing list so that every time I don’t have to create a new file. I also have a spreadsheet for all the ice cream places I visit. And I have a list of all the books that I have read in the last year. Spreadsheets are great. What data reporting techniques would you like to experiment with at ProPublica Illinois? I use statistics on a daily basis, but I’m interested in looking at other ways that we can use engagement with data, new ways of telling stories with data. At the crux of every story, people need to understand that there are humans being impacted, and that’s what I always want to keep in mind. It’s not just data points and numbers. It’s people being affected. Do you have documents, tips or data to share with Sandhya? Email sandhya@propublica.org and follow her on Twitter.

http://money.cnn.com/2017/11/14/technology/uber-driver-rape-assault-data/index.html

 On Tuesday, two anonymous women filed a complaint in California against Uber claiming the ridesharing company had falsely presented its service as safe to passengers. Both women say they were raped by drivers. They state that they ordered the service after a couple of drinks, believing it to be safe.   "Uber's advertising campaigns make the assertion that it provides the best option for a safe ride home after a night of drinking," the suit alleges. "[But] what happened to Ms. Does 1 and 2 is happening to women across the U.S. Shockingly, it is happening with greater frequency."   The new suit is seeking class action status to include individuals who have alleged or reported "rape, sexual assault or gender-motivated violence or harassment" by Uber drivers in the past four year. The lawsuit claims that "thousands of female passengers have endured unlawful conduct by their Uber drivers" over the past seven years.   In a statement, Uber said it "received this complaint today and we are in the process of reviewing it. These allegations are important to us and we take them very seriously."   Attorney Jeanne Christensen from employment law firm Wigdor LLP, who brought the case, is calling on Uber to release data that proves to customers that it is, in fact, statistically safe to ride in an Uber. "They should be forced to report, on some kind of periodic level, how many reports [of assault, rape] they've had. And based on the reports, were there investigations that actually resulted in the termination of a driver?" Christensen said in a call with CNN Tech.   Her firm has been following the issue of alleged rape and assault by Uber drivers since 2014, when it filed the New Delhi driver rape case. "I'm not asking for anything crazy. It's not crazy. If they don't have an issue, then they should be waving that data around."   The suit asks for an injunction that would direct the company to make changes to its screening process, as well as implement new monitoring of drivers to protect riders from rape, assault, and gender-based harassment.   Uber has in the past shunned the idea of fingerprint-based background tests in most markets, saying the checks can be costly and slow, and impact the company's ability to constantly bring on new drivers.   Questions about how the company screens its drivers were raised again earlier this month after the suspect in a terror attack in Manhattan was revealed to be a driver for both Uber and Lyft.   Uber said it was quickly and aggressively reviewing Sayfullo Saipov's history with the company but hadn't found any safety reports that raised concerns. Lyft also didn't find any red flags associated with his account, the company said. Both Uber and Lyft said they were in contact with law enforcement authorities over the New York attack.   Related: What we know (and don't know) about Uber background checks   The 58-page complaint filed Tuesday details 17 safety measures that the company could implement to make riders safer. Those include requiring drivers to install GPS tracking systems in their cars rather than relying on the app which can be turned off, as well as performing criminal background checks every six months.   In general, Uber says it searches records for the past seven years. But according to the suit, for drivers who moved to the U.S. less than seven years ago, the company doesn't seek to obtain records in their previous country of residence.

The long-anticipated release of genetic and health data on 500,000 British people last summer by a public consortium in the U.K. is generating a shock wave of genetic discoveries that could speed the development of new drugs and tests, scientists say. The data from the UK Biobank hit in July, after scientists in charge of 406 different projects had the chance to download several terabytes of data, including DNA data and information on everything from who has diabetes to whether people like coffee or tea. Whatâs the relationship between genes and diet? Or between DNA and schizophrenia? With 2,500 different phenotypesâor traitsâmeasured in the British volunteers, on the basis of weigh-ins, surveys, and national hospital records, this data dump is the largest of its kind and the best chance yet to figure it out. Just a few years ago, linking a gene to a human disease would have made a whole career, and it might have taken as long. Scientists had to painstakingly collect patients and request their DNA, and they often guarded the data like the gold in Fort Knox. Whatâs emerging now is a global data exchange where information about the human condition is shared, stored in the cloud, and studied with fast-evolving computer tools. âItâs a sea change in terms of data availability and the open-science movement,â says Benjamin Neale, a geneticist at the Broad Institute, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. âI do think it puts pressure on others to follow suit. Thereâs a psychological shift here that matters.â Many private and public gene banks already exist. Thereâs Amgen-owned DeCode Genetics, which started mining the genes of Icelanders in 1996. In California, 23andMe holds genetic data on more than two million customers of its direct-to-consumer testsâand has sold access to drug companies for millions. The UK Biobank is different, in part because itâs basically free and managed as a public resource. In July, scientists were provided keys to unlock the data simultaneously. âThis absolutely levels the playing field,â says Matthew Nelson, head of genetics at drug giant GlaxoSmithKline. âInstead of spending tens or hundreds of millions to build a biobank, weâre paying a $2,500 access fee.â The July data giveaway was the result of a plan conceived nearly two decades ago by British scientific and medical leaders who eventually won $250 million in investment by the U.K. government and large charities. During a recruitment drive from 2006 to 2010, half a million middle-aged Britons answered the call to donate their genetic and health information (see âThe U.K.âs Biobank Gets Intimateâ). In all, one of every 125 people in the country signed up. âI know loads of people who are in itâneighbors in my street, colleagues,â says Cathie Sudlow, the neurologist who is the UK Biobankâs chief scientist. All the volunteers had their genes analyzed on a DNA chip. Thatâs an inexpensive analysis that costs about $50 and detects some 835,000 places where the genes they inherited differ from another personâs. Think of it as a roughly pixelated copy of a personâs complete genome. Even a low-resolution genome is plenty useful. In less than two days of computer time, Neale says, the statistics whizzes in his lab were able to determine the extent to which human height, diabetes, even how much booze someone drinks could be explained using the British DNA data. Even whether someone watches TV a lot or a little is âat least a little bit heritable,â he says. Thereâs no one gene that makes you like TV, and no single âheight gene.â Instead, most common human characteristics are shaped by a blizzard of tiny contributions from all across the six-billion-letter human genome. Those are the signals geneticists are using the U.K. data to look for. For instance, in October, biologists at Kingâs College, London, crowed that theyâd pulled off âthe largest genetic study of anxiety to date.â They had compared the DNA of UK Biobank volunteers with their answers to survey questions about things like how worried and afraid they felt. They found four new âhitsâ on two chromosomes. Such hits are recorded as a sharp spikes on diagrams scientists call Manhattan plots. Until recently, some of these genetic skylines werenât any too detailed. For schizophrenia, for instance, hits have been hard to come by, and the disease remains mostly unexplained. But with more peopleâs DNA to study, the plots are starting to bristle. Anyone can look up the results using newly created online services, like the Global Biobank Engine put up by Stanford University. At GSK, the British drug company, the U.K. data is being used for âreverseâ searches. That is, instead of trying to find every gene involved in one disease, Nelson, the companyâs genetic chief, says his team wants to trace every health effect of blocking or boosting a single gene, as they might do with a drug. And it turns out that medical records of people with natural mutations in a given gene provide clues. Did they have diabetes less often? More heart attacks? Itâs like seeing what a drug does before anyone even swallows it. âThatâs going to be the main use case of the biobank for drug companies,â says Nelson. Despite selling $30 billion worth of pills a year, GSK ânever had the resourcesâ to build a private data bank of its own, says Nelson. But since the summer, GSK says, it is suddenly on par with competitors that did. After DeCode, the Icelandic company, reported an important discovery connected to asthma in March, Nelson says his team was later able to repeat the result âin a matter of hours.â Public gene data is expected to proliferate even further. In China, the Kadoorie Biobank has been recruiting half a million adults from 10 regions of the country, asking them about tea drinking, exposure to pollution, sleep, and alcohol. In the U.S., thereâs the Million Veteran Program run by the Department of Veterans Affairs as well as the Obama-era precision medicine initiative, now called AllofUs. Some startup entrepreneurs say the DNA findings are also going to increase the number, and quality, of direct-to-consumer DNA tests. Such tests, which often try to use DNA to tell people about their diet or fitness, have been criticized by some doctors as medically dubious guesswork. Yet with half a million new subjects to study, DNA predictions about peopleâs health risks will get more accurate. âWe are furiously trying to get access to that data as quickly as we can,â says Chris Glode, CEO of HumanCode, a company developing DNA âentertainmentâ tests, including one called BabyGlimpse that tells two people, on the basis of their DNA, what their kids would look like. âThe reason itâs so hot right now is itâs the first broadly available data for training models. Itâs something we can throw computers, hypotheses, against to see what we can come up with.â Sudlow, the Biobank science chief, says she doesnât think the projectâs data will be able to tell doctors who will get sick, with what, and when. âThe majority of diseases are not predictable from DNA alone. I think we are a very long way from that,â she says. âI think the role is to discover disease mechanisms, rather than working out which individuals will develop which disease.â The July data release isnât the culmination of the project. In fact, the data collecting will end only when the last volunteer has succumbed to dementia, cancer, or another cause of death. âI think our kids are going to answer the most interesting questions,â she says.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/11/15/politics-really-is-ruining-thanksgiving-according-to-data-from-10-million-cellphones/

In the wake of last year's bitterly contested presidential election, “politically divided” families cut their Thanksgiving celebrations short by an average of 20 to 30 minutes. Republican voters were more likely to bail on Democratic families than vice-versa. And reductions in family time were steeper in areas that saw more political ads. Those are among the conclusions of a new working paper by M. Keith Chen of UCLA and Ryne Rohla of Washington State University. The paper matches location data from 10 million smartphones to precinct-level voting data for the 2016 election, painting a detailed portrait of how people from predominantly Democratic and Republican areas spent their 2016 Thanksgiving holiday. In recent years, Thanksgiving has become a politically fraught time, often pitting family members with diametrically opposed political beliefs against each other over plates of turkey and mashed potatoes. Last year, for instance, news outlets across the country published stories on how to navigate political discussion with Trump-supporting uncles and socialist nephews. A majority of Americans said they hoped to avoid Thanksgiving politics completely. Surveys and anecdotes are great, but Chen and Rohla wanted to know if people actually altered their behavior on Thanksgiving as a result of the divisive election. Specifically, they wanted to know whether Thanksgiving dinners in politically divided households were cut short relative to Thanksgiving dinners among politically homogeneous families. Smartphone data could answer part of the question: “A unique collection of smartphone location-tracking data from more than ten million Americans allows observation of actual (not self-reported) movement behavior, at extremely precise spatial and temporal levels,” they write. That data came from a service called Safegraph, which collected over 17 trillion location markers from 10 million smartphones in November 2016. Chen and Rohla used this data to identify individuals' home locations, which they defined as the places people were most often located between the hours of 1 and 4 a.m. They also looked at where these people were located between the hours of 1 p.m. and 5 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day. If that location differed from the “home” location, you'd reasonably infer that a person traveled to spend Thanksgiving with friends or family. Even better, the cellphone data shows you exactly when those travelers arrived at a Thanksgiving location and when they left. To capture political leanings, Chen and Rohla collected 2016 presidential voting data at the level of voting precinct, the most finely grained level of spatial detail attainable. For the purposes of their paper, they assume that people from precincts voting for Clinton are Democrats, while those from Trump precincts are Republican. It's important to note that this represents an approximation of political beliefs — there are, after all, Democrats living in places that tend to vote Republican, and vice-versa. So for a sanity check, they tested the party preferences they assigned to their cellphone users against the aggregate two-party vote shares at both the state and national level. “At a national level the data add up to a Democratic vote share of 50.3%, compared to the actual share of 51.1%," they found. Not perfect, of course, but good enough for social science research. From there, the analysis is pretty straightforward: Do Democrats spend less time at Thanksgiving dinners in Republican households than in Democratic ones, and vice-versa? The top-line answer is “yes”: even when controlling for things like travel distance and various demographic characteristics “families that were likely to have voted differently spent between 20 and 30 fewer minutes with each other,” Chen and Rohla found. But these differences were asymmetric. Relative to 2015, Democratic voters were about 5 percent less likely than Republicans to travel for Thanksgiving in 2016. However, while Republicans were more likely to show up to a distant Thanksgiving dinner, they were also more likely to bail early: “travelers from Democratic precincts do not significantly shorten their visits to Republican hosts, while Republican-precinct travelers shortened their visits by over 40 minutes,” the paper found. Chen and Rohla also found the volume of political advertising in a precinct affected these numbers. “Thanksgiving dinners are further shortened by around 1.5 minutes for every thousand political advertisements aired in the traveler’s home media market,” they found. In a heavily saturated state like Florida, that resulted in a 1.2 hour reduction in Thanksgiving time for politically divided families. Overall, Chen and Rohla write, “our results suggest partisan differences cost American families 62 million person-hours of Thanksgiving time, 56.8% from individuals living in Democratic precincts and 43.2% from Republican precincts.” That's a pretty staggering number, indicative of the extent to which fierce partisan divisions are undermining family and social ties in the United States. And that's just on one day in the year — imagine how many people avoid phone calls or interactions with individuals of different political beliefs on the other 364 days.

In the wake of last year's bitterly contested presidential election, “politically divided” families cut their Thanksgiving celebrations short by an average of 20 to 30 minutes. Republican voters were more likely to bail on Democratic families than vice-versa. And reductions in family time were steeper in areas that saw more political ads. Those are among the conclusions of a new working paper by M. Keith Chen of UCLA and Ryne Rohla of Washington State University.

You will be up to date with all our NEWS updates, including special offers TULSA, Okla. — A new program under way in Tulsa aims to support immigrants and make the transition to living in the United States easier. The New Tulsans Initiative is a project designed to learn best ways to welcome and integrate immigrants through local government and nonprofit programs. The Oklahoma city of 400,000 is home to a large group of immigrants from Latin America as well as Asia. “Our goal with the New Tulsans Initiative is to create a city that helps immigrant Tulsans feel more welcome and included,” Christina Starzl Mendoza, a community development and policy assistant in the office of Tulsa Mayor G.T. Bynum, said. “For example, if you are an immigrant and you have a child that goes to a U.S. public school, do you know what a parent-teacher conference is? Do you know what a GPA is?" “For example, if you are an immigrant and you have a child that goes to a U.S. public school, do you know what a parent-teacher conference is? Do you know what a GPA is?" Tulsa was one of 25 communities selected in the nonprofit New American Economy’s 2017 Gateway for Growth Challenge. Launched in 2015, the program is a partnership between New American Economy and fellow nonprofit Welcoming America to support cities that the organizations said see value in immigrant populations and wish to integrate immigrants into the community, according to Kate Brick, director of state and local initiatives at New American Economy. Communities named in the challenge may receive tailored research on the economic impact of immigrants in the area, technical assistance for a strategic plan, and matching grant funding. Planning meetings for Tulsa's initiative began in November. “We started the challenge program because we were seeing so many communities developing strategies to be welcoming,” Brick said. “We had been working with them on a one-off basis for several years. We decided this was a great way to scale that work and give folks an opportunity to proactively apply.” The city of Tulsa hopes to create a strategic plan by the end of 2018 that focuses on barriers immigrants face in five key departments: health, education, economic development, civic engagement, and first response, Mendoza said. Mendoza noted that, like other cities, the immigrant population in Tulsa has been a major driver in the growth of the city. Between 2000 and 2010, Tulsa’s population overall remained stagnant at 0.3 percent. However, Tulsa’s immigrant population grew 4 percent during the same time period, according to U.S. Census data analyzed by the city. The two largest immigrant groups in Tulsa are from Latin America (58 percent) and Asia (25 percent), according to city data. About 10 percent of immigrants originate from Europe and 3 percent from Africa. Many of Tulsa’s Asian immigrants arrived as refugees. The city was identified as a refugee resettlement site for Vietnamese and Hmong refugees following the Vietnam War. Mendoza noted that a large number of Hmong Americans are vendors at the local farmers’ market. More recently, a growing number of refugees from Myanmar have arrived in Tulsa. The city is home to a large population of Zomi people in the U.S. The city is also home to immigrants from West, Central, and South Asia, and Turkish immigrants have created a Turkish House and annual festival. Barriers that immigrants face include language and culture, Mendoza said. Several organizations offer English-language classes, but they fill up quickly. And understanding U.S. customs is another obstacle. “For example, if you are an immigrant and you have a child that goes to a U.S. public school, do you know what a parent-teacher conference is? Do you know what a GPA is? How can you be successful and help your child graduate from high school and go to post-secondary education?” Mendoza said. Brick, with the New American Economy, said the organization has found that when the mayor’s office is involved in the plan it is often more successful. “When we see leadership like we’re seeing in Tulsa — where the mayor has come out and said this is a priority for the city and the business community has come out and said this is the economic interest of our city — to really be proactive and welcoming immigrants, it sends a message that this is something that is going to benefit every resident of that community,” she said. Diane Eason Contreras, director of immigrant and refugee services at YWCA Tulsa, which works with communities including the Zomi people, said the initiative is important because it brings many stakeholders together at once to collaborate. She added that gathering data and understanding the immigrant and refugee populations will be key. She also hopes it will help support students and their families so that young adults can have access to quality education. “It’s an exciting opportunity to bring everyone to the table,” she said.

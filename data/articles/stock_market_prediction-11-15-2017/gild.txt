(NASDAQ:GILD) has been struggling since its earnings announcement in late October, even though the company beat revenue estimates by $110 million, beat earnings estimates by $0.14 per share and upgraded its EPS guidance from $0.86-$0.93 to $1.02-$1.77. To add insult to injury, the stock just got hit with another downgrade from Argus — who dropped the stock from Buy to Hold — citing concerns the company is increasing R&D spending on the new CART-T therapies the company acquired when it bought Kite Pharma at the same time its blockbuster hepatitis C and HIV products are seeing declining sales. These concerns, coupled with the general pricing pressure the market is applying to biotechnology stocks, are likely to push GILD lower. The stock is currently sitting around support at $72 (which was support in mid-August and resistance in late June), but we expect it to move down to its next support level at $69 (which was support in early July and resistance in early May). ‘Buy to open’ the GILD December 70 Put (GILD171215P00070000) for a maximum price of $1.50.

Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD) is an interesting player in the Healthcare space, with a focus on Biotechnology. The stock has been active on the tape, currently trading at $72.85, down from yesterday’s close by -1.25%. Given the stock’s recent action, it seemed like a good time to take a closer look at the company’s recent data. Fundamental Analysis Money managers are always interested in a company that can find the right recipe of fundamental data because it reflects something important going on underneath the surface. Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD) currently trades with a market capitalization of $95.14 Billion. That value represents a market adjusting for revenues that have been falling by -13.17 % on a quarterly year/year basis as of the company’s last quarterly report. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For GILD, the company currently has $11.51 Billion of cash on the books, which is offset by $1.75 Billion current liabilities. You can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $12.1 Billion over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to grow in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $1.69 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 76.60% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors. Technical Analysis Sometimes, we can understand most about a stock by simply looking at how it has been trading. Looking at the stock’s movement on the chart, Gilead Sciences, Inc. recorded a 52-week high of $86.27. It is now trading 13.42% off that level. The stock is trading $80.29 its 50-day moving average by 7.44%. The stock carved out a 52-week low down at $63.76. In recent action, Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD) has made a move of -8.88% over the past month, which has come on Strong relative transaction volume. Over the trailing year, the stock is underperforming the S&P 500 by 19.32, and it’s gotten there by action that has been more volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. In terms of the mechanics underlying that movement, traders will want to note that the stock is trading on a float of 1.51% with $1.30 Billion sitting short, betting on future declines. That suggests something of the likelihood of a short squeeze in shares of GILD.

https://stocknewsgazette.com/2017/11/14/what-do-insider-trends-have-to-say-about-gilead-sciences-inc-gild/

Recent insider trends for Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) have caught the attention of investors. Patters in insider activity can help analysts formulate an outlook for a stock. In the case of GILD, the data has a lot to say about how the stock might perform going forward. Institutions own 75.10% of Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD)’s shares. The total value of these holdings, in millions, is $72,368. Among active positions in the latest quarter, 707 holders increased their positions by a total of 72.51 million shares, 755 holders decreased the positions by a total of 68.29 million shares, and 164 holders held their positions. This works out to a net increase in ownership of 4.22 million shares, and suggests that institutions are feeling bullish about the stock. Among new and sold out positions, 117 holders initiated new positions by a total of 11.76 million shares and 98 holders exited their positions by a total of 15.75 million shares. This nets out to a decrease of 4 million shares and is another bearish sign for GILD. In the last three months, insiders executed a total of 13 trades. 1 of these were buys and 12 were sells. Insider ownership decreased by a total of 578901 shares, which suggests that GILD’s key executives are feeling less optimistic about the outlook for the stock. The data from the past twelve months tells a similar story: insiders executed 21 buys and 46 sells, and ownership decreased by a net of 1.48 million shares. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Short interest is another tool that analysts use to gauge investor sentiment. It represents the number of a stock’s shares that are being shorted by investors. Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD)’s short interest is 19.6 million shares, or 1.51% of the float. This represents a decrease of -19% in the number of shares being shorted compared to the previous reading, and implies that investors felt less pessimistic about the stock during the past two weeks. Given what the insider ownership patterns are saying, it makes sense to consider the technicals to see if these pieces of information reach the same conclusion about the outlook for GILD. A composite of 13 technical indicators that includes measures such as moving averages and momentum oscillators suggests that GILD is a Strong sell, which implies that GILD is expected to underperform the market based on prior trading patterns. Conclusion 
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Institutional ownership trends suggest that the stock is cheap and the insider trading data indicates that insiders are bearish. Technical indicators (also) suggest that Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) is overvalued.

Biotech stocks are given to high volatility, given several risks confronting the sector, namely FDA decisions, clinical trial results, competitive pressure and drugs falling off patents.  Gilead Sciences, Inc.  (NASDAQ: GILD) — which has made a name for itself in the HIV and hepatitis C treatment spaces —has risks surrounding its outlook, according to Argus.  Argus analyst David Toung issued a downgrade, lowering the firm's rating on Gilead's shares from Buy to Hold. Sales of Gilead's hepatitis C products are deteriorating faster than anticipated, Toung said in a Monday note. (See Toung's track record here.) Fewer patient starts and the  competitive impact  from the launch of a pan-genotype hepatitis C drug by  AbbVie Inc  (NYSE: ABBV) have created headwinds for sales of Epclusa, Toung said. The analyst also projects an accelerated decline in Harvoni and Sovaldi sales.  Gilead's HIV products are plateauing, Toung said. Hepatitis C and HIV products account for 68 percent of Gilead's sales, according to Argus.  "More than two-thirds of Gilead's revenue is on a flat-to-down trajectory," Toung said.  See also:  Attention Biotech Investors: Here Are November PDUFA Catalysts On The Horizon  Gilead faces operating margin pressure in 2018 from declining revenues, as well as higher R&D expenses to support development of the CAR-T  program,  acquired  as part of Gilead's purchase of Kite Pharma Inc  (NASDAQ: KITE), according to Argus.  Argus lowered its adjusted earnings per share estimates for Gilead in 2017 from $8.60 to $8.50 and from $7.50 to $7 in 2018. Gilead was trading down about 1 percent at $73.05 at the time of publication.  Gilead Sciences shares have been up 3.49 percent since the start of the third quarter, outperforming the  iShares NASDAQ Biotechnology Index (ETF)  (NASDAQ: IBB), which has been up 0.68 percent. For the year-to-date period, Gilead has gained only 2.29 percent compared to the iShares NASDAQ Biotechnology Index's 17.64 percent rally Related Link:   A Big Biotech ETF Is About To Get Cheaper

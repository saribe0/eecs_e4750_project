 The top gainer with a security that increased in price during today’s trading was Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). Alphabet Inc. had a higher price at the close than it did at the open. The company holds a market cap of 698.62B with a P/E of 37.18 indicating whether its share price properly reflects its performance. Fundamentalists and value investors are seeing the low ratio of 7.04 as more positive – demonstrating that the company has a great deal of revenue with a fair price. However, technicians believes that a higher ratio would indicate the likelihood of a constant augmentation of the company’s share price. Alphabet Inc.’s P/B is valued at 4.79 exhibiting the investor sentiment on the value of the stock to its actual value. A higher P/B ratio of Alphabet Inc. is signposting that the investors have either overvalued it , or that its accountants have undervalued it. The P/B figure is also providing some ideas on whether the shareholders are paying too much for what would be left if the company went bankrupt immediately – but to consider that the company ought to have a lower P/B value. As of now, the increased share price of Alphabet Inc. makes it a lucrative buy for investors. A change of 0.02% in the price clearly indicates a strong asset performance for the corporation, , bearing in mind the total returns from its investment and dividends or distributions obtained from the investment. The ROA of Alphabet Inc. is currently valued at *tba indicating how profitable the company is in regards to its total assets. The figure tells us what earnings were generated from invested capital of Alphabet Inc.. It gives investors a clue on how effective the company is in converting the money it has to invest into net income. Alphabet Inc.’s ROI is valued at *tba relatively measuring the profitability on the investment. It evidently points out how profitable and preferable it is for the investors. The company has a current ratio of *tba gauging towards its ability in paying short-term and long-term obligations. With the existing current ratio, Alphabet Inc. is more than equipped to confront its liabilities with its assets. Alphabet Inc. has a quick ratio of *tba measuring its ability to meet its short term obligations with its most liquid assets. The high quick ratio specifies its better liquidity position on the credit terms the company has negotiated from its suppliers. The EPS growth this year is at -6.00% demonstrating an EPS growth of 28.30% in the coming year. This defines the most likely future of the stock price of Alphabet Inc.. With this high EPSGR it is predicted that growth rate will rise faster as compared to its competitors in the same industry. As it upholds an amended rate with more EPSGR it is prone to be a good target. Alphabet Inc. NASDAQ : GOOG | Wednesday, November 15, 2017    Tags (NASDAQ:GOOG) Alphabet Inc.

At the end of the day, seasoned investors know that investing in markets has a large element of gambling to it. Despite all the research, whether top down or bottom up, markets have that element of chance that looms large. But as far as bets go, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL,NASDAQ:GOOG) feels as close to a sure thing as one can get. The third quarter demonstrated that GOOGL isn’t having trouble sustaining high double-digit growth rates. Revenues were up 24% year-over-year and operating margins improved by 200 basis points as well. Other Bets revenues, in particular, was very positive. The segment delivered 53% year-over-year growth and, while the total amount for the quarter was a tiny $302 million in comparison to advertising revenues of over $24 billion, it is on the rise. Investments that fall under the umbrella of Other Bets may take longer to monetize, but I have long held that the potential for coming up with another disruptive business lies in this segment. Businesses that are included in Other Bets include Access, Calico, CapitalG, GV, Nest, and Waymo — though the majority of revenues come from Google Fiber, Nest products and services, and licensing/R&D services through Verily. Specifically, Waymo seems to be on the precipice of becoming a leader in the autonomous vehicle industry, which may surprise some given that GOOGL is not an automotive company. However, because of GOOGL’s technological edge, they have been able implement the software and hardware changes necessary to make this a reality, while traditional auto makers are more focused on energy efficiency. GOOGL has been working on this technological breakthrough since 2009, and indications are that they have the lead with early riders already on the road.

The run in big tech is far from over and, in addition to Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB), the big tech name I like most is Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). GOOG stock is trading a marked discount due to the less “sexy” nature of its growth pipeline. But that growth pipeline is stable, and might just get a big boost in the near future from the self-driving and cloud markets. Although many of Wall Street’s favorite tech names have posted explosive gains over the past 12 months, those same favorite tech stocks continue to rally to all-time highs. The latest bit of good news came from NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), the red-hot chip maker that just reported blowout numbers, underscoring that the shift to all-things-AI and all-things-cloud remains as strong as ever. Of course, NVDA’s blowout report comes on the heels of each one of the FANG stocks delivering blowout reports. All those stocks have made all-time highs over the past several weeks and months. All in all, big tech remains the sector to own in the stock market. We all know about the digital advertising growth story at GOOG. Alongside FB, GOOG dominates the digital advertising world. That is a good place to be, since there are still a ton of dollars in transit from traditional advertising mediums to digital advertising channels. This mass shift in advertising dollars is why GOOG’s advertising revenue growth rate is still accelerating (up 21% last quarter versus high-teens growth in the prior two quarters). But beyond the digital advertising growth narrative, GOOG has lesser-known catalysts which could drive GOOG stock materially higher in the long-term. Those growth catalysts are starting to come into the spotlight. Firstly, Google Cloud will start to gain significant market share in the cloud space thanks to Big Retail names ditching Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Big Retail is sending a clear message to Amazon right now: “you can’t have your cake and eat it, too.” Big Retail players don’t want to pay for a service provided by the very business which is stealing their sales and killing their margins. So they are dumping Amazon Web Services en masse. Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT) was the first to do so. Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) followed suit. Most recently, Kroger Co (NYSE:KR) bypassed Amazon for cloud investing.

The Home Depot, Inc. (HD) is an interesting player in the Services space, with a focus on Home Improvement Stores. The stock has been active on the tape, currently trading at $165.35, up from yesterday’s close by 0.76%. Given the stock’s recent action, it seemed like a good time to take a closer look at the company’s recent data. Fundamental Analysis Does this stock stack up well when compared to its peers in the industry space? Let’s take a look. The Home Depot, Inc. (HD) currently trades with a market capitalization of $195.61 Billion. That value represents a market adjusting for revenues that have been growing by 6.18 % on a quarterly year/year basis as of the company’s last quarterly report.

 The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For HD, the company currently has $4.83 Billion of cash on the books, which is offset by $545 Million current liabilities. You can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $9 Billion over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to fall in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $1.82 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 75.19% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors. Technical Analysis It’s important to check the technicals to get a sense of how HD has been acting. Looking at the stock’s movement on the chart, The Home Depot, Inc. recorded a 52-week high of $167.94. It is now trading 2.59% off that level. The stock is trading $162.70 its 50-day moving average by -2.65%. The stock carved out a 52-week low down at $122.92. In recent action, The Home Depot, Inc. (HD) has made a move of +0.69% over the past month, which has come on weak relative transaction volume. Over the trailing year, the stock is underperforming the S&P 500 by 19.32, and it’s gotten there by action that has been more volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. In terms of the mechanics underlying that movement, traders will want to note that the stock is trading on a float of 0.97% with $1.18 Billion sitting short, betting on future declines. That suggests something of the likelihood of a short squeeze in shares of HD.

Consistently, one of the more popular stocks people enter into their stock options watchlist  at Stock Options Channel is JPMorgan Chase & Co (Symbol: JPM). So this week we highlight one interesting put contract, and one interesting call contract, from the January 2020 expiration for JPM. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting, is at the $70 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $3.05. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 4.4% return against the $70 commitment, or a 2% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost  ).      Selling a put does not give an investor access to JPM's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. So unless JPMorgan Chase & Co sees its shares decline 28.3% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $66.95 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $3.05 from $70), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 2% annualized rate of return. Turning to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the January 2020 expiration, for shareholders of JPMorgan Chase & Co (Symbol: JPM) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 2.3% annualized dividend yield. Selling the covered call at the $115 strike and collecting the premium based on the $4.80 bid, annualizes to an additional 2.3% rate of return against the current stock price (this is what we at Stock Options Channel refer to as the YieldBoost  ), for a total of 4.6% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $115 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but JPM shares would have to advance 17.8% from current levels for that to occur, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 22.7% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.makeArticleAd();    The chart below shows the trailing twelve month trading history for JPMorgan Chase & Co, highlighting in green where the $70 strike is located relative to that history, and highlighting the $115 strike in red:       The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2020 put or call options highlighted in this article deliver a rate of return that represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for JPMorgan Chase & Co (considering the last 252 trading day JPM historical stock prices  using closing values, as well as today's price of $97.60) to be 16%.    In mid-afternoon trading on Monday, the put volume among S&P 500 components was 922,980 contracts, with call volume at 1.60M, for a put:call ratio of 0.58 so far for the day. Compared to the long-term median put:call ratio of .65, that represents high call volume relative to puts; in other words, buyers are showing a preference for calls in  options trading  so far today.

Investors in Facebook Inc (Symbol: FB) saw new options become available today, for the January 2020 expiration. One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 795 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the FB options chain for the new January 2020 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.    The put contract at the $175.00 strike price has a current bid of $23.55. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $175.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $151.45 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of FB, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $178.36/share today. Because the $175.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 62%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 13.46% return on the cash commitment, or 6.18% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost  .  makeArticleAd();  Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Facebook Inc, and highlighting in green where the $175.00 strike is located relative to that history:       Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $195.00 strike price has a current bid of $25.80. If an investor was to purchase shares of FB stock at the current price level of $178.36/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a "covered call," they are committing to sell the stock at $195.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 23.79% if the stock gets called away at the January 2020 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if FB shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Facebook Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing FB's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $195.00 strike highlighted in red:    Considering the fact that the $195.00 strike represents an approximate 9% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 47%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 14.47% boost of extra return to the investor, or 6.64% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost  .    The implied volatility in the put contract example is 27%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 30%. Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $178.36) to be 17%.

                    November 13, 2017
 JPM  About a month has gone by since the last earnings report for JP Morgan Chase & Co (JPM  -  Free Report)	. Shares have added about 1.6% in that time frame, outperforming the market. Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers. JPMorgan Q3 Earnings Beat Despite Trading WeaknessAmid an expected trading slump, rising rates and loan growth drove JPMorgan third-quarter 2017 earnings of $1.76 per share, which easily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.67. Also, the figure reflects an 11% rise from the year-ago period. Notably, the results included a legal benefit of $107 million.Solid loan growth (driven mainly by improved credit card loans) and higher interest rates supported net interest income. Further, rise in advisory fees supported top-line growth. A slight fall in operating expenses acted as a tailwind.As expected, fixed income and equity trading slumped during the quarter. Likewise, underwriting fees (both equity and fixed income) witnessed a fall. Also, a decline in mortgage banking income, due to higher funding costs and fall in mortgage origination volume, was a headwind.Apart from these, results were adversely impacted by an increase in provision for credit losses, mainly due to reserve build in Card portfolio.The overall performance of JPMorgan’s business segments, in terms of net income generation, was decent. All segments, except Corporate & Investment Bank, reported a rise in net income on a year-over-year basis.Among other positives, both credit card sales volume and merchant processing volume grew 13%. Further, both Commercial Banking average loan balances and Asset Management average loan balances rose 10%.Trading Slump Offset by Higher Rates & Loan Growth, Costs DownManaged net revenues of $26.2 billion in the quarter were up 3% from the year-ago quarter. Also, it compared favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $25.7 billion. Rising rates and loan growth were the primary reasons for the top-line improvement. These were partially offset by lower trading revenues, investment banking fees and mortgage banking fees.Non-interest expenses (on managed basis) were $14.3 billion, down 1% from the year-ago quarter. The fall was primarily driven by lower marketing costs and stable compensation expenses, partially offset by technology, communications and equipment costs.Credit Quality WorsensProvision for credit losses increased 14% year over year to $1.5 billion, primarily due to reserve build in Consumer loan portfolio. Also, net charge-offs were up 13% year over year to $1.3 billion.However, as of Sep 30, 2017, non-performing assets were $6.2 billion, down 21% from the year-ago period.Strong Capital PositionTier 1 capital ratio (estimated) was 14.3% as of Sep 30, 2017 compared with 13.6% as of Sep 30, 2016. Tier 1 common equity capital ratio (estimated) was 12.6% as of Sep 30, 2017, up from 12.0% as of Sep 30, 2016. Total capital ratio came in at 16.1% (estimated) as of Sep 30, 2017 compared with 15.1% as of Sep 30, 2016.Book value per share was $66.95 as of Sep 30, 2017 compared with $63.79 as of Sep 30, 2016. Tangible book value per common share came in at $54.03 as of Sep 30, 2017 compared with $51.23 as of Sep 30, 2016.OutlookFor 2017, the company projects NII to increase about $4 billion. Management expects margin expansion to continue over the next several quarters driven by higher rates and deposit re-pricing.Expect card, commerce solutions and auto division, CCB segment revenue in the fourth quarter 2017 is expected to be relatively flat sequentially as higher net interest income will be offset by the anniversary net impact of Sapphire reserve.With no change expected in the overall volatility in the fourth quarter, Markets revenues are projected to decline year over year.Management expects investment banking (IB) fees in the second half of 2017 to be down y/y, as the company had the highest IB fees on record in third quarter 2016. Nonetheless, overall sentiment remains positive with the company expecting equity issuance to continue (given the stable market backdrop) and the M&A backlog to be healthy with conditions remaining beneficial for refinancing activities.For 2017, management expects adjusted expenses to be nearly $58 billion.The company expects expenses in CB segment to remain relatively stable on a sequential basis.Management projects average core loan growth to be around 8% in 2017 that will be funded from strong deposit balance.For 2017, JPMorgan expects NCOs rate to be relatively flat across all businesses except Cards (up due to continued loan growth and the seasoning of newer vintages) and CIB (down on absence of energy related NCOs). Notably, NCOs are projected to be around $5 billion (excluding NCOs related to the student loan portfolio write-down in the first quarter 2017), driven by loan growth.Management expects credit card charge-offs to be slightly below 3% for 2017 and in the higher end of 3-3.25% in 2018.Consumer allowance for credit losses will likely increase $300 million in 2017, owing to growth across businesses, partly offset by allowance releases for the residential real estate portfolio. Further, wholesale allowance for credit losses (excluding energy and metals & mining portfolios) is expected to rise modestly. Management expects potential reserve releases in energy portfolio in the upcoming quarters, reflecting stabilizing oil prices. How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?  It turns out, fresh estimates flatlined during the past month. There has been one revision higher for the current quarter compared to one lower.

During the recent trading sessions stock of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) was gathering the crowd in the stock market. Analysts often use price and volume data to predict future stock performance. In the case of JPM, the chart has some interesting things to say about where the stock might be headed. How has the stock performed recently? JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) in the last month has increased +1.72%. Shares are now up over the past year, outperforming the broad market by -100% and outperformed a peer group of similar companies by 134%.

 Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that JPM may be headed in the future. If we want to get a sense of JPM’s future performance, we have to look at the speed and size of these price movements. Using what are known as momentum indicators, we can use the stock’s price momentum to get a sense of whether the stock is in the midst of, or nearing the end of, a current trend. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for JPM is 49.27%, which suggests that the stock is not particularly expensive or cheap, and not predisposed to a reactive price movement based on this measure. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 30.32%, tells a similar story, and suggests that JPM currently trades in neutral territory. What do the trading volumes reveal? Volume patterns can also be useful for predicting future performance. When trading activity is abnormally high, it’s often a sign that the market feels particularly strong in one way or another about the future direction of a stock. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) average trading volume of 11,398,850 during the past month is 16.78% below its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been less active than usual in the stock in recent times. What do the analysts think? JPM is currently undervalued by -2.59% relative to the average 1-year price target of $100.10 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 2.50, which implies that analysts are generally neutral in their outlook for JPM over the next year. How risky is the stock?  No study on the valuation of a stock is complete without taking into account risk. When analyzing the systematic risk associated with a stock, analysts look at beta, which measures the stock’s volatility relative to the overall market. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) has a beta of 1.21, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are more extreme than the market as a whole. JPM therefore has a above average level of market risk. During the past couple of weeks, JPM average daily volatility was 13.32%, which is 0.15 percentage points lower than the average volatility over the past 100 days.

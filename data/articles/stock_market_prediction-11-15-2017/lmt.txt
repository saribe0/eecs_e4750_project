 Defense behemoth Lockheed Martin Corp.  's LMT  Rotary Mission Systems business division secured a modification contract, to support the AEGIS weapon system (AWS). Work related to this deal is expected to be over by November 2018.  Details of the Deal  Valued at $60.2 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C. Per the terms of the agreement, Lockheed Martin will conduct  ship integration and test of the AWS for AWS baselines through Advanced Capability Build 12. Majority of the work will be executed in Camden, NJ; Norfolk, VA; Pascagoula, MS; and Moorestown, NJ.  Fiscal 2012 and 2013 shipbuilding and conversion; fiscal 2017 and 2018 other procurement; and fiscal 2018 operations and maintenance funds will be used to partly finance the deal.  A Brief-Note on AWS  Lockheed Martin's AWS is the world's premier naval air defense system and the sea-based element of the United States' Ballistic Missile Defense System. It is a seamlessly integrated radar and missile system, which has the capability to provide protection against advanced air, surface and subsurface threats. A key component of the AWS is the SPY-1 multi-function phased array radar - the world's most advanced and versatile maritime radar.  Our View  Lockheed Martin's Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) business carries out some of the company's high-profile programs, including the Aegis Combat System, Littoral Combat Ship, MH-60 helicopter avionics along with military and commercial orders. At present, Lockheed Martin's Aegis system is a sought-after maritime weapon system for nations like Australia, Japan, Norway and Spain. In the third quarter the RMS unit's revenues witnessed a year-over-year improvement. Going ahead, the latest contract for the AWS is expected to provide further impetus to this unit's growth. Additionally, the recently passed fiscal 2018 defense policy, authorizing the United States' defense spending worth $700 billion, has enhanced the prospect of increased order flow from Pentagon for major defense contractors like Lockheed Martin, Raytheon Company RTN  , Northrop Grumman Corporation NOC  , The Boeing Company BA  and others.  Price Performance  Shares of Lockheed Martin have rallied 17.7% over a year underperforming the industry  's 31% gain. This could be because the earlier budget cuts might have put pressure on the top line.         Zacks Rank  Lockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

 Dear Mr. Berko: I bought 75 shares of Lockheed Martin in late 2016 at $260 a share after reading your column praising the stock. You said that it had good dividend growth and that revenues and profits would continue to grow at an uninterrupted pace. I also remember that in some other column, you claimed that wars and the "expectation of hostilities" are very profitable for business. For some reason, the government is stopping the manufacture of the F-35 fighter plane indefinitely. Why? What's wrong here? Is Lockheed going to lose this contract? I am a little nervous about this and need to know whether you think I should take my short-term profit. — FP, Rochester, Minn. Dear FP: Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT-$312), with $50 billion in revenues, is the world's largest defense contractor. LMT derives 65 percent of revenues from the U.S. Department of Defense, 15 percent from other U.S. government agencies and 20 percent from foreign military programs. War is a wonderful business for LMT. And it's a super repeat business because planes wear down and get shot down and must be replaced, or they become damaged and new parts have to be procured and installed. It's estimated that the government will spend over $1.4 trillion in the next 20 years to maintain its fleet of F-35s. That's a hugely profitable maintenance contract. Meanwhile, production wasn't stopped; shipments were halted temporarily, but they have recently resumed. One problem is the F-35's sticker price and sloppy cost overruns. The other problem is that the Trump administration was furious at the cost increases and threatened to kill the program. In 2011, Lockheed contracted with the Pentagon to build 2,400 F-35s at a cost of $49 million a copy, but thanks to 28 super-lobbyists on LMT's payroll — plus multiple millions in "jam money" given to 37 members of Congress (also on LMT's payroll) — the cost of an F-35 had zoomed to $136 million by 2016. Lockheed's corrupt influence-peddling, using taxpayer dollars to line the pockets of flagrantly crooked congressmen, is why the cost of an F-35 exploded by $87 million in five years. Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, who publicly detests most congressmen for their lack of probity, remarked that most members of the House and Senate climax when a lobbyist brings a briefcase to a dinner meeting. Few of us realize how culpable and venal members of Congress can be. Even without the scalawags in three-piece suits or their distaff side cuties in skirts and very high heels, LMT should grow faster than other defense firms — thanks to the F-35, with which no other fighter can compare, and to an impressive turnaround at Sikorsky. Sikorsky, owned by LMT, is the leader in commercial and military helicopters. Meanwhile, international F-35 sales were given the green light by Congress. As of August, LMT had delivered 235 of these flying beasts to our allies — namely, Japan, France, Great Britain, Israel and even Saudi Arabia. These sales, including maintenance and parts, account for 25 percent of LMT's revenues. That amount should increase to 30 percent as more conflicts around the globe are instigated with the help of the CIA and American nongovernmental organizations. Don't you dare sell your LMT. Rather, buy 25 more shares, and definitely hold them indefinitely. The Trump administration asked LMT to reduce the cost of producing an F-35 by 20 percent by 2019, and when LMT is successful, the Pentagon will compensate it with lucrative no-bid contracts totaling billions of dollars for electronics and missile systems. Management expects a 23 percent improvement in net profit margins (to 9 percent) in the next four years and revenues of $61 billion in the same time period, up from this year's $50 billion. By 2022, the number of LMT's outstanding shares should fall from 440 million to 240 million. And some analysts expect a $12 dividend on earnings of $22 a share by 2022. Give management a gold star. If those numbers come close to panning out, LMT shares could trade in the high $500s. I do hope you're reinvesting the dividend, which has increased for 15 years in a row. Isn't war wonderful?

                    November 14, 2017
 NOC BA LMT RTN  Defense behemoth Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report)	 Rotary Mission Systems business division secured a modification contract, to support the AEGIS weapon system (AWS). Work related to this deal is expected to be over by November 2018. Details of the Deal Valued at $60.2 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C. Per the terms of the agreement, Lockheed Martin will conduct  ship integration and test of the AWS for AWS baselines through Advanced Capability Build 12. Majority of the work will be executed in Camden, NJ; Norfolk, VA; Pascagoula, MS; and Moorestown, NJ.  Fiscal 2012 and 2013 shipbuilding and conversion; fiscal 2017 and 2018 other procurement; and fiscal 2018 operations and maintenance funds will be used to partly finance the deal. A Brief-Note on AWS Lockheed Martin’s AWS is the world’s premier naval air defense system and the sea-based element of the United States’ Ballistic Missile Defense System. It is a seamlessly integrated radar and missile system, which has the capability to provide protection against advanced air, surface and subsurface threats. A key component of the AWS is the SPY-1 multi-function phased array radar — the world’s most advanced and versatile maritime radar. Our View Lockheed Martin's Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) business carries out some of the company's high-profile programs, including the Aegis Combat System, Littoral Combat Ship, MH-60 helicopter avionics along with military and commercial orders. At present, Lockheed Martin's Aegis system is a sought-after maritime weapon system for nations like Australia, Japan, Norway and Spain. In the third quarter the RMS unit’s revenues witnessed a year-over-year improvement. Going ahead, the latest contract for the AWS is expected to provide further impetus to this unit’s growth. Additionally, the recently passed fiscal 2018 defense policy, authorizing the United States’ defense spending worth $700 billion, has enhanced the prospect of increased order flow from Pentagon for major defense contractors like Lockheed Martin, Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report)	, Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report)	, The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report)	 and others. Price Performance Shares of Lockheed Martin have rallied 17.7% over a year underperforming the industry’s 31% gain. This could be because the earlier budget cuts might have put pressure on the top line.      Zacks Rank  Lockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) stock took a hit today with the release of its earnings report for the third quarter of 2017. Source: Praveer Sharma via Flickr Lockheed Martin Corporation’s earnings report for the third quarter of year started off bad with earnings per share of $3.24. This is down from its earnings per share of $7.93 from the same time last year. It also wasn’t able to reach Wall Street’s earnings per share estimate of $3.26, which isn’t good news for LMT stock. Revenue of $12.17 billion for the third quarter of 2017 also didn’t do LMT stock any favors. Analysts were looking for Lockheed Martin Corporation to report revenue of $12.81 billion during the quarter. Still, it was an increase over its revenue of $11.55 billion from the third quarter of 2016.

The earnings cycle is sending some mixed signals for the first time this quarter as three more widely watched stocks provided just “OK” earnings results for the quarter. With the major indices trading at their all-time highs, “OK” results are usually likely to cause traders to start hitting the “sell” button, as we’re seeing on a few stocks today. Today’s three big stock charts analyze the price patterns of Biogen Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) and McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) as two out of three of these companies are trading lower in the wake of their earnings results creating potential buying opportunities.  Biogen shares traded strongly right into their earnings report, suggesting that the company needed to nail their earnings report to avoid a “sell the news” situation that would take BIIB stock back into its trading range. The report didn’t blow investor’s hair back, so let’s see what the chart says now:  Defense stocks have been among the groups of stocks posting strong, low volatility rallies, you know, the kind everyone likes. The problem happens when a company like that misses earnings, the way that Lockheed Martin did. This quarter’s results missed expectations, although management did guide forward earnings higher, which is the saving grace right now. So, is LMT stock a buy on this dip?

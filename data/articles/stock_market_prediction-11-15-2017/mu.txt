Barry Odom has said his team is taking it one game at a time throughout the season. This time, however, there is no reason for Missouri to look past Saturday. With a win over Vanderbilt, Missouri can achieve bowl eligibility for the first time since 2014. It has been an incredible turnaround for a team that started the season 1-5, with most losses coming in double digits. In recent bowl projections, the Tigers have been tied to the Dec. 29 Belk Bowl in Charlotte, North Carolina, against Louisville (by Sporting News’ Bill Bender) and two Dec. 30 bowls: the TaxSlayer Bowl in Jacksonville, Florida, against Northwestern (by ESPN’s Kyle Bonagura) and the AutoZone Liberty Bowl in Memphis against Texas (by ESPN’s David M. Hale) or West Virginia (by Sports Illustrated’s Eric Single).

He knows how much it would mean to his team, especially the seniors, who could could have their final season of football extended. “They’ve been through a lot,” Odom said. “That was one of our goals that we talked about, having a chance to play after the regular season is over. You get to 1-0 this week, and that opens a whole other world of opportunities for us.” Ish Witter has never played better than he has in the final games of his career. The senior broke a personal record Saturday night when he rushed for 216 yards and is only 21 yards away from breaking his season high of 750 yards with two games left. During Missouri’s four-game winning streak, he’s combined for 413 yards and five total touchdowns. At 5-foot-10, Witter doesn’t have the same stature as fellow backs Damarea Crockett and Larry Rountree III, but he has been just as effective as both when given the ball. Offensive coordinator Josh Heupel heaped praise on his smaller back after Witter’s career night. “Some of the best runners I’ve been around have been smaller in stature, but they all have strength,” Heupel said. “You don’t have to be the biggest guy, but you do have to have a physical presence about you.” Despite four touchdown passes from junior quarterback Drew Lock — of 31, 50, 23 and 20 yards, respectively — and a second straight 100-yard receiving effort from Emanuel Hall, Heupel wasn’t satisfied with the Tigers’ passing attack against the Volunteers on Monday. “We didn’t throw and catch it well enough,” Heupel said. “That was extremely disappointing. Emanuel with the drops, but other guys, as well, and Drew maybe not as accurate as he’s capable of being, as well, at times. So (that will) bring our guys back down to earth maybe a little bit, and hopefully we’ll push forward and go execute at a much higher level this week.” Tennessee entered Saturday’s game with the No. 4 pass defense in the country, but Missouri’s receiving corps hurt its own cause with more than a handful of drops. Seven players registered catches, but Hall (five catches), J’Mon Moore (three catches) and Johnathon Johnson (two catches) were the only Tigers to have more than one. Lock finished with 217 yards but completed just 46 percent of his passes. Two Missouri players earned SEC awards in the wake of the Tigers’ 50-17 victory over Tennessee. Marcell Frazier was named the SEC Co-Defensive Lineman of the Week after sacking Tennessee’s Will McBride twice Saturday. Frazier, who shared the award with Kentucky’s Denzil Ware, has 5½ sacks on the season. Rountree was the other Tiger to earn an award, as he was named the SEC Co-Freshman of the Week. Rountree, who shared the award with Texas A&M quarterback Nick Starkel, ran wild for 155 yards against Tennessee and currently leads all SEC freshman in rushing touchdowns with five. While Rountree has been able to put up impressive stats for a freshman, Heupel is proud of his running back for improving his game when he isn’t personally trying to score touchdowns. “He continues to get more and more comfortable and more and more confident with every play, every game,” Heupel said. “He played his best football without the ball in his hands this Saturday, and as a young running back, those are things that are tough to pick up early in your career.” Supervising editors are Brooks Holton and Pete Bland: blandp@missouri.edu, 882-5729.

   Minister of State for Higher and Technical Education Ravindra Waikar on Monday announced that Mumbai University students could be allowed to take supplementary answer sheets in their exams. The MU had earlier banned students from taking supplements as it led to mistakes in the online assessment marking system.  Mr. Waikar said, “Problems arose when teachers gave separate bar codes for supplement sheets and main answer sheets. This led to confusion and many students lost marks for their supplements. The marks ended up being given to other students. I have directed teachers to give the same bar codes for main and supplement answer sheets. Students cannot be stopped from asking for supplement papers beyond the 40 pages in the main answer sheets.” However, teachers have been asked to check if students had left any blank pages in the main pages before asking for supplement sheets.  Mr. Waikar said from the next semester, the results would be declared within 45 days of the exams. He said, “In May, teachers were not handed over answer sheets until three months after the exams, thereby delaying results. This time, the November 8 exam papers have already reached teachers for correction.”  The Minister directed MU officials to clear bottlenecks in the online assessment system to ensure results are declared within 45 days.  Meanwhile, president of the Students’ Law Council, Sachin Pawar, has sought postponement of the first semester exams of the five-year Bachelor of Business Administration and Bachelor of Law courses scheduled for November 20, as the rule of a minimum of 90 days of academic instruction before exams was not met.  Activists of the Yuva Sena, youth wing of Shiv Sena, accompanied Mr. Waikar when he visited the Fort campus.

 Corey Fatony and Emanuel Hall are teammates now. Three years ago, they were bitter enemies.Missouri’s trip to Nashville, Tenn., this weekend to play Vanderbilt will bring Fatony and Hall back within a short drive of where the pair grew up. Both are from Franklin, a city on the southern outskirts of the Nashville metro area.Franklin, the seat of Williamson County, is compact but divided. Half the city is loyal to Franklin High School, the city’s original school established in 1910. The other half is loyal to Centennial High School, which was established in 1996 and is just 4 miles away from its rival.From 2011-14, Fatony went to Franklin. Hall went to Centennial.“It was always so much fun,” Fatony said of games between the schools. “There would be so much trash talking on Twitter. There’d be so much fuel for the fire on a Friday night. It was just a really good time getting under the lights and playing.”Football is woven into the fabric of Franklin, a town of just more than 74,000 residents.“I’ve been in other surrounding counties, but there’s nothing like a Friday night in Williamson County,” said Matt Kriesky, who has coached at Centennial since 2016.Kriesky is from Paris, Tenn., a small town in the western half of the state. He said he’s never seen students turn out for a high school game like they do for Franklin-Centennial.There are no professional or college teams in Franklin, so, like a lot of other cross-town rivalries, it’s typically the biggest ticket in town.There’s no official name for the contest — the Williamson Herald has called it “The Battle for Franklin” — but the winner of the football game gets a helmet with Franklin’s colors on one half and Centennial’s colors on the other. The winner puts a sticker designating the year of its triumph on its side of the helmet.“It is a big game for our city and our community. It doesn’t matter what the records are of either team that season, it’s going to be a packed house,” Kriesky said. … “If you aren’t doing well that season, but if you beat Franklin or Franklin beats Centennial, that almost makes your year.”Franklin historically has dominated the rivalry. The Rebels won every game between the teams for the first 16 years.Hall played a role in giving Centennial its first win during his sophomore season in 2012. He caught a touchdown pass — according to the account from the Williamson Herald — in a 42-10 victory over the Rebels.Franklin reclaimed the helmet in 2013, the pair’s junior year, setting up a rubber match in 2014, which was Fatony’s and Hall’s senior year.By then, the two were familiar. They met in eighth grade during a track and field camp set up by Hall’s parents.“We didn’t really run together,” Fatony said. “He was like a mile ahead of me.”The pair enjoyed standout senior seasons as Missouri commits. Both were named all-district, while Fatony was named the district’s kicker of the year.That year,, the schools faced off in the last game of the regular season with the rights to host a first-round playoff game on the line. Franklin scored 20 points in the fourth quarter to eke out a 37-34 win at Centennial.A quirk in the Tennessee high school football playoffs led to the two teams matching up again just seven days later, this time at Franklin.Missouri didn’t make Hall available to speak to the media Tuesday, but Fatony remembered the game well.According to the Williamson Herald, Hall put the Cougars up early. He burnded the Rebels like he’s burned a number of Southeastern Conference foes this season, catching a 54-yard go route as Centennial went up seven.In the fourth quarter, Hall found pay dirt again with a 14-yard touchdown reception that put the Cougars up two scores.“He had a huge catch on us,” Fatony said. “I don’t know why we didn’t put him in double coverage. He just made a big play against us, and the momentum shifted in their favor.”The Rebels cut the lead to five after Hall’s catch, but Centennial sealed the victory with an interception on Franklin’s last drive to win 28-23. The contest ended Fatony’s high school career.“That took me awhile to get over,” he recalled.Even with what he’s experienced in the Southeastern Conference, those games in Williamson County are unique.“Those are the memories I think about now,” Fatony said, “thinking about how much fun it was playing with my brothers.”dmjones@columbiatribune.com573-815-1787 Corey Fatony and Emanuel Hall are teammates now.

He just made a big play against us, and the momentum shifted in their favor.” The Rebels cut the lead to five after Hall’s catch, but Centennial sealed the victory with an interception on Franklin’s last drive to win 28-23. The contest ended Fatony’s high school career. “That took me awhile to get over,” he recalled. Even with what he’s experienced in the Southeastern Conference, those games in Williamson County are unique. “Those are the memories I think about now,” Fatony said, “thinking about how much fun it was playing with my brothers.” dmjones@columbiatribune.com573-815-1787

 Marshall Allen, one of the youngest of the original 11 members of the Concerned Student 1950 group, on Monday evening asked for the recently enacted speech codes at the University of Missouri to be viewed from the perspectives of those protesters.
In the fall of 2015, along with blocking the Homecoming parade to send a message to then-UM System President Tim Wolfe and camping out on Traditions Plaza to support Jonathan Butler's hunger strike, Concerned Student 1950 demonstrators protested at the financial aid office and in the office of interim Vice Chancellor Chuck Henson.
Now the speech codes prohibit entering offices with vital university records, protests in or outside official meetings and camping on campus.
“The reason why we can claim these and promote these as reactionary is because each of these have direct correlation to the events and activities that occurred in the fall of 2015,” he said.
Yet on Friday, at a meeting of the Board of Curators, three white demonstrators quietly unfurled signs asking the university to divest from fossil fuel companies. Curators Chairman Maurice Graham and President Mun Choi spoke to the demonstrators and, in a brief comment to the Tribune, Graham affirmed the system’s commitment to free speech.
Allen, who was a sophomore in 2015 and is now a senior, questioned that in light of the new policies that would otherwise have forbidden it.
“You are officially acting against and in violation of university policy,” Allen said. “Who exactly do these policies apply to?”
Allen spoke at an event sponsored by the MU Department of Black Studies called “Two Years After …” intended to measure how much has changed – and how much hasn’t – since Wolfe resigned Nov. 9, 2015. The audience that packed Wrench Auditorium saw Spike Lee’s movie about the protests, “2 Fists Up,” and heard Allen question whether university and state policies enacted since have been properly viewed from a black perspective.
Along with students and faculty, the event drew President Mun Choi, Curator David Steelman and other university leaders. Afterward, Choi said the discussion made him proud because it shows the university is willing to look at issues that are important to students, faculty and staff.
“There were comments during the presentation and afterward, if the new policies on protests are going to apply to all students or all faculty regardless of their background or experience,” Choi said. “They will, and I truly want to emphasize that.”
Along with questioning the new university policies, Allen raised issues with the new state law on discrimination claims that generated a travel warning for Missouri from the NAACP. Before the change, he said, it was difficult to prove discrimination under the standard that it was a “contributing factor” to a prohibited job or housing action. The new standard is that it is the “motivating factor.”
“When you couldn’t prove it before, now it is impossible,” Allen said.
When the Tiger football team joined the protests in the first week of November by threatening to boycott a game, the media spotlight, already on the campus because of the demonstrations, became intense. After Wolfe resigned and Columbia campus Chancellor R. Bowen Loftin was forced out, a backlash began that included condemnation from then-presidential candidate Donald Trump.
“I think it’s disgusting,” Trump said. “I think the two people who resigned are weak, ineffective people. I think when they resigned they set something in motion that is going to be a disaster for a long period of time.”
The university has lost 13 percent of its enrollment and while it has protected promised support for diversity and inclusion amid budget cuts, it has not met the goal for black faculty in the Concerned Student 1950 demands.
Stephanie Shonekan, chair of the Black Studies Department, said the event Monday was to show how much progress has been made on the issues identified by the protesters. She noted the presence of Choi. One of the major ways Wolfe angered the Concerned Student 1950 group was by ignoring them when they blocked his car during the parade.
“Our role also on this campus is to serve as the intellectual side of black life at the University of Missouri,” she said. “Tonight we want to talk about how far we have come. And we wanted to push back against the other president who said we would be a disaster. We have not been a disaster. He’s wrong.”
Among the audience were several current and prospective students who have arrived in Columbia since the protests.
Clodwige Meginord, 28, arrived in Columbia in August and is planning to enter MU in pursuit of a post-graduate degree. She was born in Haiti and came to U.S. 25 years ago.
“I think for anyone who would like to be part of an institution that has history and have people who are willing to stand for the truth, you should be here,” she said. “Because you can be the next voice, the next phase of the truth, whatever the truth is for you.”
Johanna Milord, a doctoral student in counseling psychology, said the events of 2015 drew her to MU after attending a psychology conference with student and faculty presenters from the university.
In 2015, she said, the protests against blacks dying at the hands of police received no discussion on the campus she attended.
“I remember feeling frustrated and silenced and not knowing really where to go,” she said.
The conference showed her that at MU, faculty and students work together on issues.
“I think that this is a place where the conversation is happening and that is more than I have been exposed to in the past,” she said.

U.S. stock futures are trading lower this morning, as investors keep an eye on Washington, D.C. and House Republicans’ progress on their tax plan. Skittishness is also being driven by all-time-high valuations across the board on Wall Street, with many traders unable to shake the feeling that a pullback is on the horizon. At last check, Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were down 0.18%, S&P 500 futures had lost 0.21% and Nasdaq-100 futures had dipped 0.1%. On the options front, volume was below average as only about 15.3 million calls and 12.8 million puts crossed the tape. On the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio rose to a two-week high of 0.69, with the 10-day moving average held at 0.64. As for Monday’s options activity, General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) drew considerable ire in the wake of its restructuring plan — which includes a 50% dividend cut. Meanwhile, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) sentiment began to shift back toward call options ahead of Thursday’s semi-truck unveiling. Finally, CBS Corporation (NYSE:CBS) drew arbitrage activity after announcing a $900 million senior note offering.  Investors did not like what GE brought to light yesterday. The company is spinning off its lighting and locomotive businesses to focus on power, aviation and healthcare equipment. GE also said it was looking at cutting jobs across all of its businesses. However, it was the company’s decision to slash its dividend by 50% to 12 cents per share that really sent investors running for the sidelines. GE stock fell more than 7% on the news, driving mixed activity in the options pits. Options volume topped 1.1 million, numbering more than three times GE’s daily average. Call options narrowly edged out puts, claiming 53% of the day’s take, but many of these contracts were sold. For instance, data from Trade-Alert.com reveals that blocks totaling 110,000 contracts traded at both the Dec $22 and Nov $22 call strikes. All of these contracts crossed at the bid price, ranging between 7 cents and a penny.

Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) is an interesting player in the Consumer Goods space, with a focus on Auto Manufacturers – Major. The stock has been active on the tape, currently trading at $315.40, up from yesterday’s close by 4.10%. Given the stock’s recent action, it seemed like a good time to take a closer look at the company’s recent data. Fundamental Analysis Money managers are always interested in a company that can find the right recipe of fundamental data because it reflects something important going on underneath the surface. Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) currently trades with a market capitalization of $53.01 Billion. That value represents a market adjusting for revenues that have been growing by 29.86 % on a quarterly year/year basis as of the company’s last quarterly report. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For TSLA, the company currently has $3.67 Billion of cash on the books, which is offset by $441.72 Million current liabilities. You can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $-4.88 Billion over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to grow in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $-3.11 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 58.99% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors. Technical Analysis It’s important to check the technicals to get a sense of how TSLA has been acting. Looking at the stock’s movement on the chart, Tesla, Inc. recorded a 52-week high of $389.61. It is now trading 74.21% off that level. The stock is trading $342.92 its 50-day moving average by 27.52%. The stock carved out a 52-week low down at $178.19. In recent action, Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) has made a move of -10.04% over the past month, which has come on weak relative transaction volume. Over the trailing year, the stock is underperforming the S&P 500 by 19.32, and it’s gotten there by action that has been more volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. In terms of the mechanics underlying that movement, traders will want to note that the stock is trading on a float of 22.42% with $125.33 Million sitting short, betting on future declines. That suggests something of the likelihood of a short squeeze in shares of TSLA.

TherapeuticsMD, Inc. (NASDAQ:TXMD) trades at $5.9 having a market capitalization of $1.26 billion. TXMD stock price lost -9.79% over the past year, yielding a negative weighted alpha of -11.8 percent. A weighted alpha below 0 suggest additional declines. Therefore, there is certainly still some pain for investors who want to avoid this falling stock.  Weighted Alpha is used to calculate how much a share has gone up or down over a certain period, normally a year. In general, more thrust is placed on most recent actions by assigning higher weights to it than those assigned to past movements. This assists to give a return figure that has a stronger focus on the most current period and is thus a better measure for short-term analysis. This technique is highly famous among technical analysts. If the stock is up it will have a positively weighted alpha. If the stock price is unchanged its weighted alpha will be smaller. A stock price loss will yield a negatively weighted alpha.  Support is likely to come between $5.7 a share to $5.49 a share level. However, if the TXMD shares go below $5.49 then it would indicate a much weaker market for the company. In that case, its shares would mark a 6.95% decline from the most recent price. The typical day in the last two weeks has seen about a 7.9% volatility. The average volume for TherapeuticsMD, Inc. (NASDAQ:TXMD) has been 3.1 million shares per day over the past 30 days. TXMD has a 1-week performance of 2.79%. TXMD price is down nearly -40.68% from its 52-week high price of $8.3 a share but is up about 40.68% from its 52-week low price of $3.5 a share.  Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) has accumulated 2.79% over the course of one week. It seems that Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) might see strength given an ABR of 1.8 or Buy rating. Analysts, on average, seem bullish as they suggest TSLA is worth $3.22 more, giving a target price of $318.62 a share. TXMD share have rallied by 2.25% in percentage terms since the start of the year – and added 28.82% in the last month. Volume in the last session has increased compared with TXMD’s average trading volume. We think the increased volume is representative of buyers as it has displayed in many other cases.  TSLA’s Stochastic Oscillator (%D) is at 30.99%. Values of %D line that are above 80 indicate that the security is overbought; prices could well fall in the near future. And the values below 20 that it is oversold indicate prices could very well bounce upwards. The Stochastic Oscillator is a powerful technical tool that is somewhat surprisingly easy to understand. In a basic sense, it is used by technicians to measure the speed or momentum of the price movement. It represents the location of the previous close relative to the price range over a set number of periods. This can be more easily understood, however, by pulling apart the two lines on the stochastic oscillator and explaining the simple underlying mathematical formulas. The first line is called the %K line, which analyzes the actual price movements in the shares and can be defined as: %K = (Current Close – Lowest Low)/(Highest High – Lowest Low) * 100. The second line, the %D line is simple a 3-day moving average of the %K line. There are three primary ways to read the Stochastic Oscillator in search of entry points, but traders should follow the %D line closely because that indicates major trends on the chart.  Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s latest quote $315.4 $0.23 4.1% will find technical support in $304.07 a share and a breakdown below this region would be a significantly bearish signal for Tesla, Inc. traders. Any way you dice it, a dip below $292.75 a share would be very bad news for TSLA’s technical picture in the near-term. The $292.75 level represents at least another 7.18% downside for the stock from its current price. If Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares can stay above the price resistance around $321.76 a share, that could help propel Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) higher to the next line of resistance at $328.13 a share. The typical day in the last one month has seen about a 3.02% volatility. TSLA is down around 43.5% from its 12-month high of $178.19 notched on Nov 14, 2016 but is 102.63% above its highest point the past 12 months of $-8.3 a share.

http://www.nasdaq.com/article/tesla-tsla-set-to-unveil-electric-semi-truck-on-thursday-cm876847

Tesla (Shutterstock photo) Even before the race for fully-autonomous cars — those that can actually drive themselves from point A to B without passenger intervention — have been won by the nation’s automakers, a battle is brewing to see who can produce the first driverless truck. Seen as highly disruptive to the global economy, which is worth an estimated $30 billion, Tesla (TSLA) wants to take lead in the commercial transport market. And on Thursday investors will get a chance to see how realistic the company’s ambition might be. CEO Elon Musk on Sunday tweeted that an unveiling will take place Thursday and will be broadcasted on the company’s site. The consummate sales agent, Musk, who had previously called the vehicle a "beast" and "unreal," on Sunday added that the sight of the electric semi truck "will blow your mind clear out of your skull and into an alternate dimension.”  Tesla, which has been putting self-driving technology into electric trucks, until recently has been only testing prototypes. Not much has been shared about the vehicle beyond soft mentions in April and September. Morgan Stanley analysts Ravi Shankar and Adam Jonas noted in September noted that Tesla could force other truck manufacturers to play catch up and come up with their own commercial truck plans. The industry that has also attracted interest from Alphabet’s (GOOG , GOOGL) Waymo and Uber, among others. But Musk, who has had to postpone the unveiling on multiple occasions, now believes the company is ready for primetime, calling the truck “seriously next level.” His confident words has re-ignited Tesla stock, which rose more than 4% Monday. Autonomous technology enthusiasts believe the long-haul trucking industry can benefit immensely from these trucks. Aside from the cost savings that can be realized in terms of fuel charges, self-driving electric trucks will also allow drivers to rest more, and thus attract more driving candidates. Tesla’s battery-powered rig is said to have a driving range of 200 to 300 miles on a single charge, according to Reuters. While that driving range would be much smaller than trucks operating on conventional diesels, which can travel up to 1,000 miles on a single tank of fuel, fleet operators such as Scott Perry, an executive at Miami-based Ryder, are willing to give Tesla time to develop longer-range technology. “I’m not going to count them out for having a strategy for longer distances or ranges, but right out of the gate I think that’s where they’ll start,” said Perry, according to Reuters. After disappointing the Street recently with not only reporting a wider-than-expected third-quarter loss, the company also pushed back its previous production targets for its highly-anticipated mass-market Model 3 vehicle, Musk has gotten investors excited again. Now, to the extent that the truck’s unveiling on Thursday’s will “blow my mind,” that remains to be seen. At the time of publication, Saintvilus held shares in Tesla.

  Tesla’s planned unveiling of its new line of semi-trucks may be an easy way for it to leverage its existing technology and capital and give it an edge over the competition, Joseph Spak, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said.  The commercial vehicle (CV) could give Tesla the "biggest bang for their buck" because the company need only tap into their Model 3 sedan's prototype, and recreate that for a bigger vehicle, Spak said, in order to deliver lower costs and higher reliability for the commercial truck driver. This also helps the company get closer to its mission of reducing emissions.  "For CVs, the decision tends to be purely economic," in terms of cost of ownership and utilization, Spak wrote in a note. Electronic trucks could cost less in terms of maintenance, as well as cost savings in fuel, he said. The biggest things to look out for at Tesla's November 16 event are the semi-truck's range, costs, weight and towing capacity, and its autonomous capabilities, Spak notes. He also said that its target for delivering the vehicles, as well as the associated costs, could play a large part in the truck's reception.  This is welcome news for the company after the first half of the year has been marred by production delays of its Model 3 sedan, which has sent its shares on a roller coaster ride. "While we don’t have meaningful reason to doubt that Tesla can eventually achieve its targets, doing so in a timely manner without some growing pains could prove challenging," Spak said. He added that while the company's long-term prospects may not be impacted, the company's failure to hit its near-term targets could "hold back the stock" or offer a "more favorable risk/reward entry point." Shares of Tesla are up 46.92% this year.

After having delayed the debut of its semitruck to focus on Model 3 hiccups and Puerto Rico’s energy needs, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) will unveil the electric truck Thursday. But it may not drive the sales investors want, according to Bernstein.  Bernstein analysts Toni Sacconaghi Jr. and David Vernon, who respectively cover the technology sector and logistics and transportation stocks, maintained a Market Perform rating on Tesla with a $265 price target. Expecting a Class 8 truck with a 300- to 450-mile range, Bernstein considers Tesla’s addressable market limited to less than half of the 940,000-unit-per-year semi market. Many drivers log 600 miles per day and may be disincentivized to delay deliveries with charging interruptions, the analysts said. A doubling of range would expand Tesla’s TAM to 100 percent, according to Bernstein.  Tesla may also face headwinds in relatively low fuel prices and uncertainty around charging rates, charge cycles and the role of autonomy, but its net present value may lend an edge, Sacconaghi and Vernon said.  Based on initial performance expectations, Bernstein projects a 3-percent market share over five years to contribute 7 percent of Tesla’s 2025 revenue forecasts. “On net, despite a potentially compelling value proposition, we do not see the Tesla Semi opportunity as a thesis changing initiative for the company, at least initially,” Sacconaghi and Vernon said, proposing a release date in mid-2019. “It is somewhat unclear why the company needs another major initiative (beyond Model 3, forthcoming Model Y, battery production, solar roofs and energy storage) on its already full plate.” Tesla is up 60 percent year-over-year but down 16 percent month-over-month. The firm posted a bottom-line quarterly miss Nov. 1 and has been dragged by Model 3 mishaps and EV tax credit uncertainties. At the time of publication, shares were trading up 1.3 percent at $307.

Shares of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) have broken the bullish trend line following an earnings report that missed on nearly every metric. TSLA is still up a staggering 45% so far this year as faith and belief, not revenue or earnings, had taken shares to fresh all-time highs before the recent pullback. Faith and belief can only go so far, though, and I look for Tesla to have trouble heading appreciably higher for the foreseeable future. In my previous post on TSLA from Oct. 24, I felt that Tesla stock had topped out and was headed to $303, which proved to be the case. In a recent CNBC interview, noted TSLA bear Gabe Hoffman of Candens Capital highlights numerous issues surrounding the Model 3, autonomous driving and cash burn. He also says Tesla CEO Elon Musk makes Donald Trump look like an angel. While it certainly may be his short position in Tesla shares talking, many of the points made are absolutely valid. 
Click to Enlarge TSLA stock has suffered some serious damage from a technical perspective. Both the 50- and 200-day moving averages have been broken with conviction. A major head-and-shoulders double top has formed with the $320 neckline having been obliterated. The 200-day moving average of $320.42 also coincides with this major resistance area. TSLA is now down 20% from the all-time high near $390, which is indicative of a bear market. This all points to serious upside push back at the $320 level going forward for Tesla shares.

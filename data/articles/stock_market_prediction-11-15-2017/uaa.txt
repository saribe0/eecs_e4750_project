 The Seawolves scored an interesting hat trick of recruits this week.  The daughter of the man who holds the UAA men's basketball record for career steals is joining the women's basketball team. The son of a man who played four seasons of hockey for the hated Nanooks is joining the hockey team. And the last of an extended family's long line of Anchorage high school sports stars is joining the men's basketball team.  Jahnna Hajdukovich of Dimond, Tanner Schachle of the Fairbanks Ice Dogs (via Wasilla High) and Tobin Karlberg of Grace Christian each made commitments to play for the Seawolves this week.  Hajdukovich is a high-scoring senior guard for the Dimond Lynx girls basketball team, the runner-up at last season's Class 4A state tournament.  From 1995-99, her dad Jim was a high-scoring guard for the Seawolves. He owns the career record for steals (192 in four seasons) and ranks third in assists (238), fourth in 3-pointers (238) and sixth in scoring (1,472 points).  "When I was little I always said I was going to beat my Dad's records," Hajdukovich said via Twitter. "Now I hope I can make that true."  Hajdukovich said she picked the Seawolves in part because of her family's ties with the school — both of her parents played basketball there (Michelle Titus-Hajdukovich played from 1997-99).  But what really sealed the deal for her was the program itself. The UAA women are a perennial powerhouse and are ranked fourth in the nation.  "Honestly what really sold me was how dedicated and solid the UAA women's basketball program is," Hajdukovich said. "The coaches always give their full commitment and I'm more than prepared to give them mine."  [Talking sports with … Dimond guard Jahnna Hajdukovich]  Like Hajdukovich, Schachle is the son of two former collegiate athletes — both of them Nanooks. His dad, Trent, played hockey for UAF from 1992-96 and his mom, the former Holli Pulver, played volleyball for UAF from 1994-96.  "(My dad) jokes about it with me and says it's gonna be tough wearing the green and gold, but my family supports me," Schachle said in a phone interview Tuesday.  Schachle, 20, will join UAA after four seasons of junior hockey — one with the Kenai River Brown Bears, one with the Okotoks Oilers of Alberta, and two with the Fairbanks Ice Dogs. In 16 games this season with the Ice Dogs, Schachle has scored four goals and eight assists.  Schachle skipped his senior year at Wasilla High to play junior hockey. In his final year of high school hockey, he was coached by dad Trent, who was a star for the Warriors back in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  After four years at UAF, Trent Schachle played several years of minor league hockey, even after he and Holli began their family. Tanner remembers being a toddler back when Trent played for the Adirondack IceHawks of the old UHL.  "He's the biggest influence in my life, in my hockey career, in everything," Tanner said. "When he was playing pro we lived in New York for a couple years and what I remember, being 4, 5, 6 years old, is it was just super awesome.  "He played college hockey, then he played semi-pro and made money at it, and that planted the seed for me. It's what I want to do."  A big power forward, Schachle said UAA coach Matt Thomas was the first college coach to reach out to him.  Schachle boasts size — he's 6-foot-3 and 200 pounds — and the skills to skate with the puck. He said he needs to improve his play in the defensive zone, "but my play with the puck is what UAA wants me to come in for."  The family-ties theme continues with Karlberg, who is entering his senior season with Grace Christian as the reigning Class 3A Player of the Year. His cousin, Colton Lauwers, played for the Seawolves from 2011-14.  Karlberg is part of an extended family that over the years has produced four Players of the Year — he and his brother Leif both won Class 3A Player of the Year honors in basketball, Lauwers was the Class 4A Player of the Year in 2009 and another cousin, Kayla Sims, was the 2013-14 Gatorade Player of the Year in volleyball.  The youngest of the combined Karlberg, Lauwers and Sims clan, Karlberg is the first member of UAA coach Rusty Osborne's current recruiting class.  "Tobin has had great role models and mentorship from both his family and the coaching staff at Grace," Osborne said in a press release.  "… He has the IQ and leadership ability to play point, but he also possesses the shooting and scoring ability needed from a 2-guard. In addition, he has worked hard to develop his body physically and should have little trouble transitioning to the college level."  [Karlberg keeps up family tradition for Grace Christian basketball team]  At Grace Christian, Karlberg has started every game of his career at the varsity level and has piled up 1,637 points through three seasons.  As a junior, he shot 60 percent from the field and 46 percent from 3-point range while averaging 23.8 points per game. He led the Grizzlies in steals and assists and carried them to their first Class 3A state championship in 16 years.  Here's a list of Alaska high school athletes who have signed National Letters of Intent to play college sports:  Hockey  Tanner Schachle, Wasilla (UAA, Division I)  Boys basketball  Kamaka Hepa, Barrow (Texas, Division I) Tobin Karlberg, Grace Christian (UAA, Division II)  Girls basketball  Jahnna Hajdukovich, Dimond (UAA, Division II)  Volleyball  Zoey Keene, South (UAF, Division II)  Track and field/cross country  Emma Nelson, Chugiak (Oregon State, Division I) Tessa O'Hara, Anchorage Christian (Union University, Division II)

Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Under Armour, Inc. UAA, which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further confirms weakness in UAA.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen 19 estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from 37 cents a share a month ago to its current level of 21 cents.Also, for the current quarter, Under Armour has seen 17 downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 2 cents a share from 21 cents over the past 30 days.   The stock has also seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 24.4% in the past month.

     Welcome to the sixth episode of Full-Court Finance, a podcast from Zacks Investment Research focused on the intersection of sports, business, and the stock market. On this week's episode, we take an in-depth look at Under Armour's UAA  climb from startup to multibillion-dollar sports apparel powerhouse, and why its fortunes changed so quickly. Shares of Under Armour have fallen off a cliff in 2017, and Kevin Plank's company recently posted its first quarterly sales decline since going public more than a decade ago. The reasons behind Under Armour's third-quarter slump range from shifting domestic shopping habits, to declining sales at sports retailers such as Foot Locker FL  and Dick's Sporting Goods DKS  , as well as consumers' newfound love for athleisure. On top of a need to bolster direct-to-consumer sales and add more non-competitive apparel options, it seems that having stars such as Tom Brady and Steph Curry on its roster, and sponsoring college powerhouses like UCLA and Notre Dame, has not been enough to propel Under Armour to the heights many predicted. Under Armour also faces increased competition from Adidas ADDYY  in North America, while the company still struggles to compete with Nike NKE  in nearly every business segment. However, the company's recent downturn has forced Under Armour to make some changes-that investors should take note of-in order to get back on track. Make sure you listen to the entire episode of Full-Court Finance if you want to find out more about Under Armour's recent woes and what the sports apparel company might do to turn things around going forward.

http://www.thenorthernlight.org/newest-addition-to-uaa-athletic-department/

As of the end of October 2017, the University of Alaska Anchorage introduced the addition of a new Associate Athletic Director of Development. Now a part of the athletic’s 13-sport community, Tanya Pont took over the responsibility for donor development and relations. Pont brings a significant amount of experience and knowledge to UAA as she has previously worked in a related field for over 18 years at SMG of Alaska, Inc. SMG was the management corporation that previously employed Pont as the Director of Marketing, but due to the recent budgetary issues, Pont and Joe Wooden, former general manager of the Sullivan Arena, were both dismissed in Aug. 2017. At SMG, Pont had a broad range of responsibilities and connections that will now help facilitate her career at UAA. Pont was appointed to be in charge of coordination of promotions, advertising campaigns, internal and external communications, public relations functions and media buys relative to the Sullivan Arena and its public events. For UAA, Pont’s experience will not only benefit current athletic community members, but future ones as well. “I volunteer for many local organizations that benefit youth athletics and support education,” Pont said. “These are my passions. I understand that, as a community, we need to work together to ensure opportunities for our children. In my new position at UAA, I can move this passion forward to help ensure that my children may have a chance to represent the hometown team.” Pont will not only work to develop relationships with future athletes, but past athletes as well. “I am working with Alumni Relations on a campaign to better engage alumni student-athletes. In order for UAA Seawolf Athletics to continue to be competitive in their respective sports and in the classroom, it is important to have a partnership with those alumni that have realized the benefit of graduating in green and gold,” Pont said. In addition to relevant experience, Pont has a B.S. in Corporate Communications that she obtained from the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs (1994-1998). Pont should be able to initiate communications and marketing strategies for the Alaska Airlines Center clients due to her experience establishing relationships with new business prospects, while continuing existing customer relations and support. At her previous job, Pont accumulated many specific successes that could transfer over as experience to UAA. “There were other events that we helped to bring to Alaska, including Nitro Circus, but one of the most satisfying accomplishments was being able to coordinate with local charity organizations to host a community holiday gift distribution center,” Pont said. Pont heightened community engagement and revenue through successful public relations campaigns. “I have a prior working relationship with UAA Athletics, having served on event committees for the GCI Great Alaska Shootout and Kendall Hockey Classic, and acting as their event logistical contact for events hosted at the Sullivan Arena. I have also developed relationships over the years with many of UAA’s key donors and alumni base,” Pont said.  Her previous achievements and future goals for UAA have already been recognized and acknowledge by other athletic department and UAA faculty. “We are pleased to add a seasoned professional like Tanya [Pont] to the UAA Athletics team. Her wealth of experience and knowledge in the Anchorage-area market is a great asset,” Tim McDiffett, interim athletic director, said.  In addition to her practical experience in a professional work environment, Pont joins the athletic department with valuable collegiate athletic experience. During her time at UC Colorado Springs, Pont participated as a dual collegiate athlete in both basketball and softball.

In 2005, Ryan Walsh of Fairbanks earned a scholarship to run track and field at UAA. Aiming to combine his passions for soccer and the short sprints, Walsh transferred to Humboldt State University after his sophomore year where he tore a labrum in his hip that put his athletic career on hold. Working in the weight room enabled him to stay active and engage with his team on a regular basis. “That’s when I started liking lifting a lot and realized it would be fun to start doing that as a profession,” Walsh said. After finishing up his collegiate eligibility, Walsh stayed at Humboldt State University to lay the groundwork for his professional career in the athletic world. “I started volunteer coaching for the track and field team and handled all their weight training,” Walsh said. “That’s when I started working for the head strength and conditioning coach, Drew Peterson, at Humboldt State and it went on from there.” The opening of the Alaska Airlines Center in 2014 and the introduction of its strength and conditioning department introduced a new opportunity to Walsh that drew him back to Alaska. Michael Friess, head track and field coach, as well as director of the strength and conditioning department, offered his former athlete the position as strength and conditioning coach. Walsh gladly took it. Since then, Walsh has been a force in the department, with the help of assistant coach Adam Friese, and was named head strength and conditioning coach. “What makes coach Ryan Walsh a successful strength coach is the effort he puts into getting to know his athletes,” Grant George, senior thrower for UAA’s track and field team, said. “He is familiar with the talents, strengths, and limitations of the athletes he coaches.” Walsh’s daily schedule is filled with coaching activities, mentoring his athletes and the logistic aspects of the job. “I oversee the daily operations in the weight room,” Walsh said. “I write up the training programs for our athletes, take them through the programs, oversee daily maintenance of the equipment, make sure that logistics are all working and so on.” Martins Onskulis, alpine skier at UAA, appreciates Walsh and Friese’s innovative training, experience and passion for what they are doing. “Ryan [Walsh] and Adam [Friese] are like teachers to us; the only difference is that the classroom is a gym,” Onskulis said. “Ryan is doing a great job by planning workouts for us, it’s definitely a tough task since skiing involves not only lifting weights, but also balance, agility, jumps and other specific exercises. I have worked with Ryan and Adam for four years and I have become stronger and most importantly smarter in planning my workouts.” Walsh and Friese enjoy seeing their athletes improve their strength and experience the benefits of their gained strength in their individual sports. “I have several athletes who have literally tripled or quadrupled their max lifts from their freshmen year to later points in their career and their athletic performance has shown their hard work,” Friese said. “I love that I can give them an objective measurement that shows their progress as a result of their hard work.” Walsh and Friese’s love for what they do does not go unnoticed. In times of injury, athletes often find themselves working in the weight room more than usual to find alternative ways to stay in shape. Gymnast Marie-Louise Knapp recently underwent ACL surgery and is happy about the encouragement she received from Walsh and Friese. “I like the variety and the combination of weight training and gymnastics conditioning,” Knapp said. “Especially during my recovery from my ACL surgery, Ryan and Adam motivated me every day and thought of creative exercises to keep me busy and in gymnastics shape.” While putting his athletes’ well-being at top priority and spending hours in the Alaska Airlines Center to accommodate the different teams’ individual schedules, Walsh uses his late nights and downtime to work on his own lifting in the gym. Walsh is a successful powerlifter in the community, winning local meets and also competing at the national level. Currently competing in the 230-pound weight class, Walsh holds personal records of 639 pounds on squat, 419 pounds on the bench and 606 pounds on deadlift. Walsh also drew Friese into the sport, who used to compete in hockey, before retiring and taking the position as strength and conditioning coach at UAA. “My passions for athletics and weight training quickly grew and when I finally hung up my skates I was able to focus solely on fitness,” Friess said. “But I wasn’t much interested in powerlifting until I met Ryan [Walsh]. He gave me one of his programs and after following a three-month plan I realized I had a knack for the sport and a desire to compete. The rest is history.” Walsh continued to introduce powerlifting to members of the Anchorage community as he founded a powerlifting club at UAA, The Last Frontier Lifters, with the help of Colin McGill, current chemistry professor at UAA and an active member of the powerlifting community in Anchorage. Lately, they had to hand the club over and hope that it will continue attracting generations of University students. “We had a few athletes that were really dedicated and stayed with it, but I was spread too thin at the time, as well as Colin McGill,” Walsh said. Still, Walsh encourages everyone interested in powerlifting to try it out and join the community in Alaska. “Powerlifting has a great role in Alaska. It actually has a pretty long history here,” Walsh said. “The community is very friendly and willing to help people getting into the sport.” Walsh recommends USA Powerlifting Alaska, a Facebook group for Alaskan powerlifters, to find resources, ask questions and meet the powerlifting community. Additionally, Southside Strength and Fitness is a meeting point for many powerlifters from Anchorage to meet and train together or UAA’s The Last Frontier Lifters club.

 The UAA women's basketball team will bring home a nice souvenir from its first road trip of the season – an undefeated record.  The Seawolves, the nation's fourth-ranked Division II team, overcame a cold-shooting first quarter to bury Cal State Los Angeles 77-50 on Saturday to run their record to 3-0.  Hannah Wandersee, a 6-foot-1 junior center, continued her strong start with 16 points on 8 of 10 shooting. She has scored in double figures in all three victories as well as in last week's exhibition loss to Division I powerhouse Duke, a setback that doesn't count on UAA's record.  Wandersee led a balanced effort that produced rebounds from all 12 players, points from 10, assists from 10 and steals from eight.  "Our defense was responsible for this win today," said UAA head coach Ryan McCarthy, who earned his 150th career coaching victory. "We were OK once we found our rhythm in the second quarter, but we need to get off to a stronger start, especially offensively.  "The bottom line, though, is that we're happy to be unbeaten after three games and looking forward to finally playing in front of our home crowd next week."  After hitting just 5 of 16 shots in the first quarter, UAA connected on 25 of 48 (52.1 percent) the rest of the way.  Down 14-13 after the first 10 minutes of play, the Seawolves grabbed the lead for good midway through the second quarter on a layup by Wandersee.  Rodericka Ware, a senior guard, had a game-high five steals to go along with 14 points, four assists and four rebounds for the Seawolves.  Shelby Cloninger, a senior forward, added 13 points and a game-high seven rebounds and Yazmeen Goo, a sophomore guard, chipped in nine points and a game-high five assists.  The Seawolves make their home debut in the Seawolf Hoops Classic that runs Friday and Saturday at the Alaska Airlines Center. UAA plays Holy Names on Friday and Western State on Saturday. Both games start at 5:15 p.m.

 The UAA women's basketball team will bring home a nice souvenir from its first road trip of the season – an undefeated record.  The Seawolves, the nation's fourth-ranked Division II team, overcame a cold-shooting first quarter to bury Cal State Los Angeles 77-50 on Saturday to run their record to 3-0.  Hannah Wandersee, a 6-foot-1 junior center, continued her strong start with 16 points on 8 of 10 shooting. She has scored in double figures in all three victories as well as in last week's exhibition loss to Division I powerhouse Duke, a setback that doesn't count on UAA's record.  Wandersee led a balanced effort that produced rebounds from all 12 players, points from 10, assists from 10 and steals from eight.  "Our defense was responsible for this win today," said UAA head coach Ryan McCarthy, who earned his 150th career coaching victory. "We were OK once we found our rhythm in the second quarter, but we need to get off to a stronger start, especially offensively.

For UAA, the company currently has $258 Million of cash on the books, which is offset by $297 Million current liabilities. You can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $79.31 Million over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to fall in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $0 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 31.12% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors.

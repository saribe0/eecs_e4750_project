 Recent price movements in the stock of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) have caught the attention of the investment community.

Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) in the last month has increased +4.96%. Shares are now up over the past year, outperforming the broad market by -100% and outperformed a peer group of similar companies by 470%.

(NYSE:WMT) has been trading in a bullish manner, based on the relative positions of the stock’s 20 and 200 day moving averages. Momentum indicators 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that WMT may be headed in the future. In order to predict this, technical analysts look at momentum indicators, which measure the speed and magnitude of these price movements. The idea is that as momentum slows, it may signal the approach of key support or resistance levels and a reversal of recent trends. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for WMT is 71.26%, which suggests that the stock may be primed for a trend reversal or a corrective pullback in price. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 93.54%, tells a similar story, and suggests that WMT currently trades in overbought territory. What do the trading volumes reveal? Price isn’t the only tool analysts use to forecast future performance. Volume patterns can also reveal some important insights. If, for instance, a stock’s volumes suddenly increase by a significant amount, it’s usually a sign that the level of conviction behind the trade is high. Investors may feel very strongly about the future direction of the stock in question. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) average trading volume of 6,796,150 during the past month is 21.49% below its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been less active than usual in the stock in recent times. What do the analysts think? WMT is currently overvalued by 2.93% relative to the average 1-year price target of $88.33 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 2.40, which implies that analysts are generally neutral in their outlook for WMT over the next year. How risky is the stock?  When analyzing a stock’s price performance, it’s essential to take risk into account. Beta, which measures a stock’s volatility relative to the overall market, can be used to gauge the level of systematic risk associated with a particular stock. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has a beta of 0.34, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are less extreme than the market as a whole. WMT therefore has a below average level of market risk. During the past couple of weeks, WMT average daily volatility was 12.79%, which is 2.44 percentage points lower than the average volatility over the past 100 days.

Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) is an interesting player in the Services space, with a focus on Discount, Variety Stores. The stock has been active on the tape, currently trading at $90.99, up from yesterday’s close by 0.08%. Given the stock’s recent action, it seemed like a good time to take a closer look at the company’s recent data. Fundamental Analysis It’s important to get a feel for how any stock is actually valued on the market based on its core numbers. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) currently trades with a market capitalization of $269.95 Billion. That value represents a market adjusting for revenues that have been growing by 2.07 % on a quarterly year/year basis as of the company’s last quarterly report. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For WMT, the company currently has $6.47 Billion of cash on the books, which is offset by $7.17 Billion current liabilities. You can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $17.54 Billion over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to grow in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $0.97 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 32.52% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors. Technical Analysis We’ve taken a serious look at this stock from a fundamental perspective, but the tale of the tape may offer more hints about what lies under the surface. Looking at the stock’s movement on the chart, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. recorded a 52-week high of $91.69. It is now trading 0.7% off that level. The stock is trading $83.71 its 50-day moving average by -7.28%. The stock carved out a 52-week low down at $65.28. In recent action, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) has made a move of +6.12% over the past month, which has come on weak relative transaction volume. Over the trailing year, the stock is underperforming the S&P 500 by 19.32, and it’s gotten there by action that has been less volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. In terms of the mechanics underlying that movement, traders will want to note that the stock is trading on a float of 3.12% with $1.41 Billion sitting short, betting on future declines. That suggests something of the likelihood of a short squeeze in shares of WMT.

Now trading with a market value of 269.95B, the company has a mix of catalysts and obstacles that spring from the nature of its operations. Everyone seems to have their own opinion of this stock. But what do the numbers really say? We think it’s a great time to take a fresh look. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) Fundamentals That Matter It’s generally a good idea to start with the most fundamental piece of the picture: the balance sheet. The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base.

 Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) Revenue Growth Potential As far as key trends that demonstrate something of the future investment potential of this stock, we need to take a closer look at the top line, first and foremost. Last quarter, the company saw 123.36 billion in total revenues. That represents a quarterly year/year change in revenues of 0.03 in sequential terms, the WMT saw sales decline by 0.05.

http://www.nasdaq.com/article/interesting-january-2020-stock-options-for-wmt-cm876444

Consistently, one of the more popular stocks people enter into their stock options watchlist  at Stock Options Channel is Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (Symbol: WMT). So this week we highlight one interesting put contract, and one interesting call contract, from the January 2020 expiration for WMT. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting, is at the $75 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $3.45. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 4.6% return against the $75 commitment, or a 2.1% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost  ).      Selling a put does not give an investor access to WMT's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. So unless Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. sees its shares decline 18.4% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $71.55 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $3.45 from $75), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 2.1% annualized rate of return. Turning to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the January 2020 expiration, for shareholders of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.

Investors in Facebook Inc (Symbol: FB) saw new options become available today, for the January 2020 expiration. One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 795 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the FB options chain for the new January 2020 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.    The put contract at the $175.00 strike price has a current bid of $23.55. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $175.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $151.45 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of FB, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $178.36/share today. Because the $175.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 62%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 13.46% return on the cash commitment, or 6.18% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost  .  makeArticleAd();  Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Facebook Inc, and highlighting in green where the $175.00 strike is located relative to that history:       Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $195.00 strike price has a current bid of $25.80. If an investor was to purchase shares of FB stock at the current price level of $178.36/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a "covered call," they are committing to sell the stock at $195.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 23.79% if the stock gets called away at the January 2020 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if FB shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Facebook Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing FB's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $195.00 strike highlighted in red:    Considering the fact that the $195.00 strike represents an approximate 9% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 47%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 14.47% boost of extra return to the investor, or 6.64% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost  .    The implied volatility in the put contract example is 27%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 30%. Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $178.36) to be 17%.

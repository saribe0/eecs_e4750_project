By all accounts, the iPhone X is doing well for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). And the one-two punch of the radically new iPhone X and the iPhone 8 is seeing enough iPhones moving off shelves to kick AAPL stock into record-high territory. But what about next year? Rumors are already flying about Apple’s plans to keep consumers buying new iPhones in 2018. The strategy seems to be going big, with a 6.5-inch iPhone X Plus and 6.1-inch iPhone 9 added to the lineup. At the end of August — before Apple had even unveiled the iPhone X — a report emerged from South Korea’s ETNews. Citing unnamed industry sources, the report claimed that Apple was working with Samsung on next-generation OLED displays in 5.85-inch and 6.48-inch sizes. That would equate to what would be announced in September as the iPhone X, but also a larger model even bigger than Samsung’s Galaxy Note 8: an iPhone X Plus. One of the more respected names in Apple predictions, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, just released a new research note which was picked up by MacRumors. In it, Kuo suggests Apple will launch a trio of new iPhones in 2018, all based on the general design of this years iPhone X. That means a notched display, and TrueDepth cameras across the lineup, with Face ID replacing Touch ID altogether. Naturally, there would be a second generation iPhone X. Currently priced at $999+ as Apple’s most expensive ever offering, the iPhone X would become the standard model. Those with even deeper pockets or the desire for the most screen real estate possible could opt for an iPhone X Plus, with a massive 6.5-inch OLED display. Where things get even more interesting are with Kuo’s prediction that Apple will also release a more budget-friendly ($649 – $749) 6.1-inch model that looks like the iPhone X, but uses a cheaper and lower resolution LCD display instead of OLED. While Kuo doesn’t come out and say it, this lower cost option could be the iPhone 9. With iPhone sales making up the lion’s share of Apple revenue (and subsequently driving AAPL stock), the company is always laser-focused on how to keep that train rolling. One thing Apple has undoubtedly noticed is that Samsung does very well with its Galaxy Note series phablets –the Galaxy Note 7 battery disaster notwithstanding. These super-sized smartphones sell particularly well in Asian markets, where a smartphone often replaces a PC for its owner. Despite having the largest display ever on an iPhone, some iPhone X owners have noticed it actually feels smaller. That’s because the 5.8-inches is based on a standard diagonal measurement. The iPhone X display is longer and narrower than ever and overall, the 5.5-inch iPhone 8 Plus actually has more screen real estate. With an iPhone X Plus at 6.5-inches, Apple could make a flagship iPhone with a display that truly feels huge, in a form factor about the same size as its current Plus models.

Wall Street is seeing red this morning, as U.S. stock futures point to extended losses. The headline Dow Jones Industrial Average is headed toward triple-digit losses on the open, as tax plan worries and falling oil prices combined to push stocks lower. Crude was down more than 1% after the American Petroleum Institute reported a surprise buildup in U.S. inventories. Heading into the open, Dow futures were down 0.51%, S&P 500 futures had plunged 0.48% and Nasdaq-100 futures were lower by 0.41%. On the options front, volume rebounded on Tuesday, with about 17.7 million calls and 12.9 million puts changing hands. On the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio dipped to 0.62, with the 10-day moving average rose to a one-month high of 0.65. As for Tuesday’s options activity, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was active after the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) launched an investigation into allegations of patent infringement. Meanwhile, JD.com Inc(ADR) (NASDAQ:JD) drew heavy call volume despite a downgrade from Morgan Stanley. Finally, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) dividend capture plays were everywhere yesterday ahead of the company’s ex-dividend date.  Apple is once again at the center of a patent dispute, but this time the USITC is getting involved. The agency said it was following up on complaints from Aqua Connect Inc and Strategic Technology Partners of Orange, California. According to the USITC, it is investigating patents related to certain Apple Mac computers, iPhones, iPads, iPods and Apple TVs. The negative press comes at a bad time for AAPL stock. The shares are retreating from recent highs near $175, and AAPL’s decline yesterday took the shares below support at their 10-day moving average. Today’s heavy market selling threatens to push AAPL back below $170. AAPL options traders don’t appear too worried, however. Volume on Tuesday topped 363,000 contracts, with calls accounting for an above-average 64% of the day’s take. December, meanwhile, is thick with call open interest. Currently the back-month put/call OI ratio comes in at 0.48, with calls more than doubling puts heading into the final expiration month of 2017. Peak call OI for December totals nearly 52,000 contracts at the overhead $180 strike.

  Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway raised its stake in Apple by 3%, to 134 million outstanding shares, in the third quarter, a regulatory filing released Tuesday showed. The conglomerate owned about 2.6% of Apple shares as of September 30, the 13F filing for the quarter ended September 30 showed. That made Berkshire the fifth-largest owner of Apple's outstanding shares, according to Bloomberg data. Though Buffett famously avoids technology companies, Apple fits his investing philosophy. Besides being a strong consumer brand, the iPhone maker pays regular dividends and spends on buybacks. Apple has also traded at a lower price-to-earnings ratio than many of its peers. Berkshire Hathaway first invested in Apple in 2016 when it bought 10 million shares. Buffett said in August that he had never sold Apple shares and did not pay attention the calendar when deciding to buy. In Q3, Berkshire raised its stake in the agricultural-biotech company Monsanto by 10% and increased its holding in Synchrony Financial. The firm slashed its stake in IBM. "I don't value IBM the same way that I did six years ago when I started buying," Buffett told CNBC in May. Major investment firms, including hedge funds, are required to disclose their long positions in stocks every quarter. Because of a time delay, however, these positions may have changed or been closed by the time the filing is public.

 Per a research report  by Canalys, Apple Inc AAPL  was the market leader in the wearables bands space in the third quarter of 2017, benefiting from the launch of Watch Series 3. Canalys analyst Jason Low stated that "strong demand for the LTE-enabled Apple Watch Series 3 has dispelled service providers' doubts about the cellular smartwatch not appealing to customers." He also added that Apple Watch 3 hasn't reached its "full potential" as service providers underestimated its demand. In the third quarter of 2017, Apple took the lead with shipments of 3.9 million units including 800,000 LTE editions. Apple called Watch series 3 as the "ultimate expression of Apple Watch" at its key note address at the September event. Integrated with a built-in cellular and Apple Music, the Watch is powered by a new dual core processor, which is 70% faster than its predecessor. Users can now call, text as well as access GPS and third-party applications like WeChat with the Watch. Apple had touted the built-in cellular as the USP of the Watch. However, initially, the Watch had troubles connecting to LTE. A bug caused the watch to join unauthenticated Wi-Fi networks, thus preventing it from connecting to cellular networks. In October, Apple released the watch OS 4.0.1 update to Apple Watch Series 3, which fixes the bug. We note that Apple doesn't provide any data on Watch sales. On its last earnings conference call, the company said that Watch sales were up 50% for the third successive quarter while the entire wearables business was up 75% year over year. Though its current contribution to the top line is minimal, Watch underscores Apple's efforts to reduce its dependence on iPhone. iPhone sales constitute the major chunk of Apple's revenues.   Apple Inc. Revenue (TTM)      Apple Inc. Revenue (TTM)    |      Apple Inc. Quote   Coming back to the report, Xiaomi and Fitbit FIT  occupied the second and third spots in the wearables space with shipments of 3.6 million and 3.5 million units, respectively. Overall, the market was down 2% to 17.3 million units, marred by falling demand of basic bands, added the report.  Zacks Rank and Share Price Movement  Apple carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

AAPL – Apple Watch Series 3 helps propel Apple back to the top of the wearables market. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) climbed back on top of the wearables charts in the third quarter, according to researchers at Canalys. Apple shipped 3.9 million Watches in the latest period, which is its best effort so far this year. Around 800,000 of the shipments were Apple Watch Series 3’s, which are the latest version that includes LTE cellular capabilities, meaning they don’t require a wifi connection to access the internet. The Verge has more details on how Apple usurped the competition: Apple’s competitors, Xiaomi and Fitbit, trailed behind in Q3, shipping 3.6 million and 3.5 million wearables, respectively. Still, their performance was better than average in the sluggish Q3, according to Canalys, where business has historically been slower. The Apple Watch Series 3 initially had some LTE connectivity issues that were fixed by a software update a few weeks after its release. And so far, the Watch has been the biggest driver of Apple’s wearable sales. In all likelihood, Apple would have sold significantly more Watches in the quarter if they’d only be able to produce more. The company faces a similar problem with the iPhone X right now, where demand is far outstripping supply of the new device, which is proving difficult to manufacture in its early days. Apple Inc. shares fell $1.13 (-0.66%) in premarket trading Wednesday. Year-to-date, AAPL has gained 50.32%, versus a 16.94% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period. AAPL currently has a StockNews.com POWR Rating of A (Strong Buy), and is ranked #1 of 28 stocks in the Technology – Hardware category.

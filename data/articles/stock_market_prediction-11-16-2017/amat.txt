Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) stock flux has recently been causing stir among the investment community. Many experts agree that the truth about a stock is best reflected in the way it moves on the chart. For this stock, the chart has a lot to say about future performance. How has the stock performed recently? Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) in the last month has increased +4.49%. Shares are now up over the past year, outperforming the broad market by -100% and outperformed a peer group of similar companies by 156%. After the latest session, which saw the stock close at a price of $56.36, AMAT sits below its 52-week high. Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) has been trading in a bullish manner, based on the relative positions of the stock’s 20 and 200 day moving averages. Momentum indicators 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that AMAT may be headed in the future. Fortunately, there is way to use the speed and magnitude of these price changes to predict future performance, thanks to what are known as momentum indicators. As momentum slows, it might be a sign that a support or resistance level has been reached, and that a trend is about to reverse. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for AMAT is 62.77%, which suggests that the stock is not particularly expensive or cheap, and not predisposed to a reactive price movement based on this measure. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 71.39%, tells a different story, and suggests that AMAT currently trades in overbought territory. What do the trading volumes reveal? Volume patterns can also be useful for predicting future performance. When trading activity is abnormally high, it’s often a sign that the market feels particularly strong in one way or another about the future direction of a stock. Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT) average trading volume of 8,906,695 during the past month is 9.33% below its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been less active than usual in the stock in recent times. What do the analysts think? AMAT is currently undervalued by -5.56% relative to the average 1-year price target of $59.68 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 1.80, which implies that analysts are generally bullish in their outlook for AMAT over the next year. How risky is the stock?  When predicting the future performance for a stock, it’s also important to take into account risk. To do this, analysts often use a stock’s beta, which measures the stock’s volatility relative to the overall market. Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) has a beta of 1.84, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are more extreme than the market as a whole. AMAT therefore has a above average level of market risk. During the past couple of weeks, AMAT average daily volatility was 20.11%, which is 7.01 percentage points lower than the average volatility over the past 100 days.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) could very well be worth $1 trillion within months, and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) may not be far behind in joining the prestigious group. Morgan Stanley's Brian Nowak maintains an Overweight rating on Amazon's stock with an unchanged $1,250 price target. Amazon boasts three high-margin revenue streams that happen to be growing faster than the core retail business, Nowak said in a Sunday note. (See Nowak's track record here.) The AWS cloud segment is projected to grow at a compounded growth rate of 33 percent through 2020, followed by Other (advertising and other initiatives) at 32 percent and Subscriptions at 28 percent, the analyst said. These three units are likely to grow as large as Amazon's core retail business and contribute approximately 50 percent of Amazon's total gross profit dollars, he said.  Nowak conducted a sum-of-the-parts valuation of the pieces of Amazon's business that would drive a $1 trillion valuation: Shares of Amazon gained 0.7 percent Monday morning and are higher by 50 percent since the start of 2017.

Shutterstock photo Thanksgiving and Christmas is right around the corner and Amazon (AMZN) is wasting no time looking to capitalize on its Prime strategy for its Whole Foods acquisition. The e-commerce giant plans to drop Whole Foods prices on several traditional holiday menu items, including organic turkeys for all customers and “an even deeper discount on organic and no antibiotic turkeys for Prime members,” read the company’s press release. Whole Foods will sell organic turkeys for $3.49 per pound, while non-antibiotic turkeys will fetch for $2.49 per pound. Upon the closing of its $13.7 billion deal for the upscale supermarket retailer, which sent shockwaves throughout the market, Amazon promised that Prime members would receive "special savings and in-store benefits” at Whole Foods. It would seem Amazon is ready to honor that promise. “These are the latest new lower prices in our ongoing integration and innovation with Amazon, and we’re just getting started,” said Whole Foods CEO John Mackey in a statement. “In the few months we’ve been working together, our partnership has proven to be a great fit. We’ll continue to work closely together to ensure we’re consistently surprising and delighting our customers while moving toward our goal of reaching more people with Whole Foods Market’s high-quality, natural, and organic food.” Amazon added that these recent price discounts Amazon are just a sample of the savings Prime customers can expect on a regular basis once Prime is fully entrenched as Whole Foods’ official rewards program. This means that Whole Foods, once referred to as “Whole Paycheck” for its higher-end and often more-expensive grocery products, is poised to shake that moniker given that consumers will soon enjoy shopping at more affordable prices. While there’s the risk of reducing prices too much, which can hurt Whole Foods margins, Amazon is betting that the reduced prices might be enticing enough to compel shoppers to drive a few extra miles, presumably bypassing grocers such as Costco (COST), Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM), which saw their shares tumble more than 2.5% on the news. On Wednesday shares of Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT) and Kroger (KR) also declined. Kroger and Wal-Mart were down by as much as 2%, while Target, which offered downbeat outlook for the holiday quarter, lost more than 9% of its value. The extent to which Amazon and Whole Foods can now compete on price is a scary proposition for traditional grocers, who may soon find their shares trading in discount bins. For Amazon, Whole Foods is an attractive way to not only broaden its Prime shopper base, it’s also a nice entry into the $800 billion grocery business in the United States. And the fact that Amazon can now use these 470 Whole Foods stores (located in North American and the United Kingdom) to enhance its fulfillment initiatives will make it that much tougher for competitors to effectively respond.

AMZN – Amazon is engaging in another round of price cuts at its Whole Food supermarkets just in time for the holidays. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) just announced another round of price cuts at its Whole Foods chain of supermarkets, in an effort to boost holiday shopping traffic. CNBC has more details on the discounts: Customers will be able to purchase organic or non-antibiotic turkeys at a reduced price of $3.49 per pound and $2.49 per pound, respectively. Members of Amazon Prime will save an additional 50 cents per pound on both varieties, the company said in a release. A Whole Foods representative told CNBC that cashiers will identify Amazon Prime members when customers present coupons sent via email. The company didn’t say how much of a discount it was offering. “We’re just getting started” on reducing prices after the Amazon buyout closed in August, Whole Foods CEO John Mackey said in a statement. “We’ll continue to work closely together to ensure we’re consistently surprising and delighting our customers while moving toward our goal of reaching more people.” Other products like chicken breast, shrimp, canned pumpkin, specialty potatoes, and more will also be seeing price cuts. Amazon didn’t say how long the price reductions would last, but it’s safe to assume they’ll stick around at least through Christmas. Earlier this year, Amazon permanently lowered prices on key items like produce and fish in order to help shed the natural supermarket chain’s “Whole Paycheck” image. The e-commerce giant closed its acquisition of Whole Foods back in late August. Amazon.com, Inc. shares were trading at $1,124.46 per share on Wednesday afternoon, down $12.38 (-1.09%). Year-to-date, AMZN has gained 49.95%, versus a 16.59% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period. AMZN currently has a StockNews.com POWR Rating of A (Strong Buy), and is ranked #3 of 50 stocks in the Internet category.

Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) is an interesting player in the Services space, with a focus on Catalog & Mail Order Houses. The stock has been active on the tape, currently trading at $1125.35, down from yesterday’s close by -0.33%. Given the stock’s recent action, it seemed like a good time to take a closer look at the company’s recent data. Fundamental Analysis Does this stock stack up well when compared to its peers in the industry space? Let’s take a look. Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) currently trades with a market capitalization of $544.10 Billion. That value represents a market adjusting for revenues that have been growing by 33.72 % on a quarterly year/year basis as of the company’s last quarterly report. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For AMZN, the company currently has $12.77 Billion of cash on the books, which is offset by $6.58 Billion current liabilities. You can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $7.72 Billion over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to fall in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $1.85 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 61.96% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors. Technical Analysis Sometimes, we can understand most about a stock by simply looking at how it has been trading. Looking at the stock’s movement on the chart, Amazon.com, Inc. recorded a 52-week high of $1135.54. It is now trading 10.19% off that level. The stock is trading $1,006.73 its 50-day moving average by -1124.35%. The stock carved out a 52-week low down at $710.10. In recent action, Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) has made a move of +12.21% over the past month, which has come on Strong relative transaction volume. Over the trailing year, the stock is underperforming the S&P 500 by 19.43, and it’s gotten there by action that has been more volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. In terms of the mechanics underlying that movement, traders will want to note that the stock is trading on a float of 1.47% with $402.33 Million sitting short, betting on future declines. That suggests something of the likelihood of a short squeeze in shares of AMZN.

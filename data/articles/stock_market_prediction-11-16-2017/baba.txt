309 Park Ave., Worcester • 508-752-8822 • babasushi.com For a long time, Baba was the only restaurant in this area to offer the true panache of a big city restaurant, its modern Asian decor and unassuming sophistication setting it apart from the rest of Worcester’s dining scene. That is, objectively, no longer true. With more options on the horizon for local patrons, including at least one new sushi spot to which this magazine recently awarded four out of five stars, one would suspect the buzz around Baba might finally begin to fade into more of a murmur. On the contrary, the converted residential space at 309 Park Ave. is teeming with customers who are as fresh as its sashimi. A new crop of diners seem to unearth Baba each week. Once referred to by locals as “Boston-caliber,” Baba has effectively set its own superb standards, granting it a unique identity all its own and raising the bar for other Worcester proprietors. The space itself is cramped, if not intimate. Winter coat season just about guarantees you’ll be bumped or jostled on your next visit. Those willing to squeeze past the bar and navigate the dimly-lit dining room will find Baba’s rear annex a bit more spacious. Here, a melodic fountain and a slew of petite bamboo tables offer a welcome view of the sushi chef working diligently at his station.  Service is warm and informative, though spread thin at times. Neither the menu nor the wine list changes with any frequency, ensuring servers can offer guidance and opinions on nearly every dish. On busy evenings, it can take upwards of 30 minutes from the time your chopsticks hit the empty plate until you settle up the bill, though not for lack of urgency on the staff’s part. Visitors will likely spot owner Wilson Wang, who was trained at Oishii in Chestnut Hill, as he breezes back and forth between Baba and his neighboring venture, Chuan Shabu. He also operates the sister Baba Sushi in Sturbridge.  Guests should not limit themselves to sushi, but should opt as well for a few of the starters, including the Baba oyster shooters ($5), each one served with a quail egg yolk that slides past the lips in a briny and tropical flood of the senses. It is wise to request an order of the hamachi kama ($14), a double-baked, tender yellowtail jaw served with teriyaki sauce, but quantities are supremely limited. The staff will suggest the “Tartaki Trio” ($23), referred to on most Japanese menus as tataki or tosa-mi. The seared maguro (bluefin tuna), shiro maguro (escolar) and sake (salmon) are served with distinctive sauces that reveal Wang’s aptitude for identifying a unique balance to reckon with the American palate. Likewise, the edamame ($6) demonstrates a sense of control with its simple and even seasoning. The jalapeno yellowtail ($12) is Baba’s ultimate demonstration of refined restraint in its presentation of a narrow plate of yellowtail sashimi infused with citrus sauce and delicately-topped with jalapeno and caviar. The dish offers a wet, bright heat that is at once jolting and refreshing. Still, a trip to Baba is incomplete without sushi rolls. The cucumber sashimi shiro ($16) is stunning on its best day, but depending on the chef, can at times appear sloppily executed. With proper polish, the maguro, tuna, salmon and Alaskan king crab practically glow within a single, hand-sliced cucumber wrap topped with vibrant mango salsa and severe black caviar. Alternately, fussy eaters will devour the Lion King Maki ($16), an inviting combination of spicy tuna, tempura crunch, Alaskan king crab and eel sauce.  The wine list has remained relatively constant in my memory and the Tohu Sauvignon Blanc ($10) is nothing if not reliable for those who are partial to ripe, tropical fruit. In regards to sake, servers can point guests in the direction of creamy, full-bodied selections to pair with oily fish or something big and funky to compliment Baba’s lighter rolls. And there’s always Sapporo ($8.95), for those who prefer a crisp Japanese lager with their sushi. Baba is a Central Mass institution, a fact only emphasized by the onslaught of new restaurants bringing newcomers to town. Visitors should expect a level of consistency in the quality of Wang’s dishes that can’t be relied upon at younger establishments in the neighborhood. The price tag will reflect this echelon of excellence. On our last visit, dinner for two with one round of drinks rang $109.09, not including the tip.

https://investorplace.com/2017/11/reasons-baba-stock-heading/

Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA) has had an impressive run. BABA stock is up 112% so far this year, but I, like many analysts, don’t think the ride is over yet. As we draw closer to the beginning of 2018, it’s hard to imagine BABA stock price dropping. In fact, the firm looks poised to have a bumper 3rd quarter. There are many growth catalysts on the horizon for Alibaba, and that suggests that the firm’s share price will push above $200 within the next few months. Here’s a look at three reasons BABA stock has the potential to rise above $200 by the end of January: It’s impossible to mention Alibaba right now with out talking about Singles Day, a massive shopping holiday in China where people are encouraged to spend money on themselves. Think ‘Black Friday’ on steroids. Singles Day always takes place on November 11, and this year Alibaba did $25.3 billion in sales during the made-up holiday. To put that into perspective, Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) had its annual Prime Day sale and was estimated to have moved $1 billion worth of goods, and last year’s Black Friday weekend only totaled about $8 billion. If that doesn’t add some fire to BABA’s stock price, I’d be very surprised. Alibaba practically invented Singles Day and its massive success is a testament of BABA’s ability to influence Chinese consumers. It also is a sign that China’s middle class is ready to spend some if its disposable income, which is something I have questioned in the past. Perhaps the biggest reason to get excited about Singles Day is the second reason BABA stock is likely to climb in the months ahead- Ling Shou Tong, or “connect retail.” Alibaba founder Jack Ma has been looking to expand BABA’s reach through cloud computing and logistics businesses and Ling Shou Tong is his answer. Ahead of Singles Day, Alibaba made its way into about 600,000 convenience stores, or 10% of the total number of independent convenience stores in the country, by upgrading their computer systems and acting as a kind of inventory management system. BABA allows the stores to manage procurement and sales, but the company’s Ling Shou Tong app uses customer data to help the stores determine which goods to stock and how to display them. Alibaba then ships the goods itself to fill stores’ orders.

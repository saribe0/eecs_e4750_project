Sector rotation was the name of the game Wednesday. While oil stocks returned to Earth, financials were flying high. Perhaps the biggest bank stock reveling in the gains is Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), which has already climbed 2.20% yesterday. With the BAC stock uptrend now reaffirmed, bull trades are worth a shot. The timing of today’s jump was fortuitous. Recent selling pressures were threatening to reverse BofA’s uptrend. Over the past six trading sessions, BAC shed 5% of value falling all the way to the 50-day moving average. Chart watchers often view a break of this indicator as a negative omen signaling a trend reversal. Remaining above the 50-day keeps a stock in the good graces of bulls everywhere. The high volume accompanying BAC’s decline was also worrisome. Remember, high volume down days suggest distribution or widespread selling by institutions which often weighs on a stock for days to come. If yesterday’s sharp rebound sticks, it will mostly negate the damage dealt by the distribution. If this is the beginning of BofA’s next advance, then there’s no time like the present to deploy bullish trades.   With the return of volatility, the premium in BAC stock options is getting juiced once more. And that’s increasing the appeal of short premium strategies like the naked put. The stock’s cheap price tag ($26) will keep the margin cost for the trade minimal which creates a more attractive return on investment. Sell the Dec $26 put for 43 cents. If the stock remains above $26 for the next month, the put will expire worthless allowing you to pocket the max reward of 43 cents. That may not sound like a lot, but the initial cost of the trade is only $455, so we’re looking at a potential 9.5% return on investment. That’s decent cash flow for one month’s worth of work.

Source: Shutterstock It’s reasonably safe to say that whatever lingering problems Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) had with the subprime mortgage meltdown from 2008 are not just in the past, they’re well in the past after lingering an unusually long time for this particular bank. Indeed, BofA has moved on to a whole new set of problems that nag owners of BAC stock, like dealing with soured loans to struggling energy companies and a merely so-so investment banking business. Even then though, there’s no denying Bank of America is finally offering the stability and predictability investors have been wanting for a long while now. It’s time to move deeper into the details, pinpointing exactly what’s working and not working for the megabank. And one simple chart can do the deed. Kudos to Bank of America for finally turning the corner 2015 and 2016. Earnings per share of BAC stock took a turn for the better in 2015, and 2016 is when we saw the top line start to edge higher. The progress is still a little uneven, but at least the progress is measurable. The follow-up question any savvy investor should be asking now: What is Bank of America doing well, and what is it doing poorly? It needs to do more of the former, and needs to fix the latter. As they say, read ’em and weep. 
Click to Enlarge For investors not familiar with BofA’s divisional breakdown, its Consumer & Business Banking arm caters to retail consumers, taking deposits, making mortgage loans, and helping customers open checking accounts. That unit is doing fine, revenue-wise and in terms of income. The company’s Global Banking business, which meets the basic banking needs of larger, institutional customers here and abroad (including investment banking services), is doing fine as well. Its Global Markets and Global Wealth and Investment Management divisions, on the other hand, have been persistently lackluster.

Segment is a startup that helps companies collect customer data from a variety of siloed sources and place that data in a single usable record. Today, it announced it has added a new tool to prepare for the EU’s GDPR privacy guidelines, which are coming in May next year. The new tool makes it a simple matter to stop collecting data or completely remove a person’s information from the system in a process known as the “right to be forgotten.” Segment has made a name for itself by providing a set of APIs that enable it to gather data about a customer from a variety of sources like your CRM tool, customer service application and website and pull that all together into a single view of the customer, something that is the goal of every company in the customer information business. Before you get creeped out by the data collection angle, realize that this company isn’t gathering this data to sell it, it’s gathering it so that the company you do business with has a clearer understanding of your interactions with them across the company. That means if you ordered something online, then went into the store, the clerk can look up your customer record and see all of your interactions, something that just isn’t that easy to do at this point for most companies. “Our perspective around customer data, is that consumers want a personalized experience, so companies need to understand their customers,” Peter Reinhardt, Segment co-founder and CEO told TechCrunch. But he understands that customers don’t want their interactions sold to a third party, which he likens to the grocer gossiping with the banker about what you bought. In reality, it’s painfully difficult to move this data where it’s needed. “Being a customer-centric business these days, especially in digital channels is effectively a problem of data infrastructure and Segment helps companies [solve] that,” Reinhardt explained. The flip side of that is that it can now help you stop gathering information too. It has added a new API, that lets you stop collecting data on an individual, who requests that. Under GDPR rules, a company is duty bound to comply with that request. What’s more, if the individual wants you to strike all of their customer data from your records, you can do that too. If you think about what Segment does, gather all the data about a customer in one place, it greatly simplifies the ability to act on a removal request because instead of having to look across multiple systems for the customer information and check each one, Segment is doing all of that work for you in an automated fashion. Segment was founded in 2011 and released its first product in 2012. It has raised over $108M including a $64 M Series C round in July led by Y Combinator. It currently has 180 employees to go along with 15,000 customers including Hotel Tonight, Atlassian, Crate & Barrel ,Draft Kings and New Relic.

With enforcement of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation on the horizon, compliance with the new rules of engagement has become a critical driver of business priorities. The GDPR, which replaces the previous data-security regime with stricter obligations on data controllers and processors, applies a comprehensive set of mandates addressing the processing and management of personally identifiable information (PII). Many organizations simply don’t know where to start when it comes to the GDPR directive. A recent survey by SAS reveals that less than half of respondents have a structured plan in place for compliance, while 58 percent believe their organization is not adequately aware of the risks of noncompliance. The implications are startling given that certain violations, especially those seen as important breaches of private data, result in levies of up to 20 million euros or 4 percent of global annual turnover for the preceding financial year, whichever is the greater. The cost of noncompliance is high, however it is also an opportunity to right-fit an intelligent automated approach to data governance that will result in a more agile, competitive organization. Extraction and analysis of data within contracts plays a very important role in compliance with the new EU rules, as organizations are tasked with ensuring contracts contain provisions regarding the responsibilities of any suppliers or agents that may be handling data. This includes how and when data will be returned or deleted after processing, and the details of the processing itself such as subject matter, duration, nature, purpose, and types and categories of data. Another aspect of contract data of relevance to GDPR compliance is language in contracts which describes what constitutes a data breach, and the specific obligations and legal rights in the event one occurs. The definition of a breach is a bit vague under the new EU statutes, but is considered to occur if the breach may “result in a risk for the rights and freedoms of individuals.” When there is a breach, it is important to understand the entry point, as well as the obligations of all parties for notification. Did it occur through the fault a vendor or supplier? If yes, do contracts indemnify the injured party and provide compensation for losses? Are there proper insurance clauses and coverage that covers for any loss? Ensuring these adequate protections are built into all contracts is crucial. Notification or other obligations as a result of data breach are also mandated under the GDPR framework. This means that any obligation clauses in any existing contracts are no longer valid. As a result, obligation language should be revised in all contracts to reflect GDPR rules, and to eliminate legal ambiguity which could have been otherwise avoided, or confusion by the parties. The regulations also allow for individuals to ask if their personal data is being captured and processed, and if it is, the organization must be able to produce copies of the data subject’s personal information in electronic format. Organizations are required to ensure contracts contain provisions regarding the tasks and responsibilities of the data processor, including how and when data will be returned or deleted after processing, and the details of the processing itself. This presents a challenge as some of this data may come in the form of scanned documentation in an image format. Information that is currently digitized will need to be reviewed, particularly contracts handled by data processors. This can pose a significant challenge to organizations, as contracts of this nature are often spread across the entire contract corpus. Moreover, converting the images that contain text into searchable documentation by applying OCR technology, and then finding, identifying, and reviewing pertinent vendor contracts is a long and often expensive process. Getting into compliance with the new GDPR rules will require a data governance policy and framework that specifically addresses the unique challenges of data contained in contracts. For many organizations, particularly those that do not already have systems in place, navigating regulatory requirements, monitoring and staffing will be daunting. Research and advisory firm Gartner estimates that less than 50 percent of all organizations will be in full compliance with GDPR by the end of its first year. However, adherence to this new EU mandate on data security will also provide companies with the confidence of knowing where all of their contracts are and what they say. Indeed, this is a powerful step toward becoming a truly data-driven organization.

Businesses face far more than just fines for non-compliance with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, a survey has revealed. Half of UK consumers polled said they do not trust companies with their personal data, and many are willing to take legal action against those who do not comply with the GDPR, according to a study commissioned by security firm Thales. It is not just western countries such as the US and the UK that are being targeted by hackers, as the rapidly developed and wealthy nations of the Middle East become targets of both politically and financially driven attacks. Discover how cyber security expertise can help businesses in the Middle East navigate digital transformations and keep cyber criminals at bay.  You forgot to provide an Email Address.

By submitting your personal information, you agree that TechTarget and its partners may contact you regarding relevant content, products and special offers.  You also agree that your personal information may be transferred and processed in the United States, and that you have read and agree to the Terms of Use and the Privacy Policy. Only one in five (20%) of UK consumers claimed to trust financial institutions with their information; 23% said they trusted healthcare providers, but retailers are trusted by just 6%. Thales eSecurity’s 2017 Data Threat Report revealed that two in five retailers globally have experienced a data breach in the past year, and a third had suffered more than one. More worryingly, 70% of UK consumers believe their information has been made available for sale online by cyber criminals. However with the EU GDPR’s implementation just over six months away, three-quarters of UK consumers (76%) believe increased regulation will improve the privacy of their online data. The research revealed more than a third (37%) of UK consumers had heard of the GDPR and almost two-thirds (57%) of these could explain it to some degree. Aware of the GDPR, and what it means for the privacy of their information, the study report said consumers appear to be willing to take a stand against those organisations that fail to comply, with 58% of UK respondents claiming they would consider legal action. More than three-quarters (79%) of respondents said they would consider taking their business to another company if the one they were dealing with did not comply with the regulation, while 69% suggested they might report a non-compliant organisation to the relevant industry watchdog. More than three-quarters of UK consumers (77%) suggested a failure to comply with the GDPR would negatively impact their perception of an organisation. Intended to improve personal data protection and increase accountability for data breaches, the GDPR presents a significant challenge for organisations that process the personal data of EU citizens, regardless of where the organisation is headquartered. The survey reveals businesses are concerned the new data privacy regulations will have a negative impact on their operations and international relations, and that there are a number of reasons why organisations may have more to fear from the GDPR than just consumer action and fines. Some 63% of UK-based organisations believe implementing measures to become GDPR-compliant will increase the level of complexity and bureaucracy in their business. Almost half (49%) are concerned the GDPR will hinder their organisation’s innovation to some degree, and one in five (21%) expect GDPR to have a negative impact on relationships with their international partners. While 22% of UK businesses believe the GDPR will lead to fewer data breaches, almost a third (32%) are concerned its implementation will actually result in an increased number of breaches. Despite these concerns, more than a third of UK organisations (37%) remain optimistic that the GDPR will have no effect on their business operations. “As a result of recent and ongoing data breaches, digital privacy remains top of mind for consumers,” said Jim DeLorenzo, solutions manager for GDPR at Thales eSecurity. “With the deadline for compliance with the GDPR fast approaching, law firms and compensation companies will begin to focus their efforts on fighting for consumer rights, and organisations could find themselves facing multiple legal challenges in addition to the hefty fines provided by the regulation. “The GDPR is a change of legislation that well and truly puts the onus on organisations to get their houses in order, and the clock is ticking,” he said. DeLorenzo said that to help businesses make sure they are ready for GDPR, Thales eSecurity has compiled some guidelines and resources. Enjoy the benefits of CW+ membership, learn more and join.

If the blockchain is going to be an immutable record, you need to start with clean data. The question is, how do you get clean data into a blockchain database to begin with. It’s kind of a quandary for use cases not starting with a green field, but Venzee, a startup that has been helping customers clean up their retail supply chain data to share with large vendors, thinks it has an answer. Venzee CEO Kate Hiscox sees this as a data transformation problem, something her company has been working to solve for the past three years in the retail space. That sector is awash in spreadsheets that have to be manually prepared to share with big retailers and their database requirements, she says. Venzee acts as as a data transformation layer, taking your spreadsheet information in its current form and helping to convert that data into a format that the big retailers like Amazon and Walmart can use. It’s bringing a level of automation, she says has been missing from this industry, one she has worked in for 18 years. If you think about the blockchain, it’s really just a fancy new database, one where you have to ensure that the data going in is correct or you face having bad data in a system that is supposedly immutable and irrefutable. That would be a real problem. Hiscox’s company has created a product called Mesh to deal with this. It’s essentially a data transformation tool for the blockchain that can work for a retail supply chain kind of scenario or other blockchain data transformation requirement and prepare the data to be moved in the appropriate format while providing a data review phase to ensure that it’s accurate, she says. This involves a three-phase process. In the first, the data is validated, and this is a key phase for blockchain data. In the second it’s transformed to work in the new format and finally it’s transferred. Say for example, you were moving data from a land registry to the blockchain. It would require moving the data from its current format, then validating the ownership records before putting it on the blockchain. This tool offers a path to doing that, but it also raises questions about the validation process. If the blockchain is supposed to a trust-based system, how do you ensure that you aren’t creating a means to alter data instead of validating it? These are questions that need to be answered, but this tool is about getting the data ready and moving it. The system will require checks and balances beyond that. This tool is currently available in private Beta and will be released in the first half of 2018.

Illustration: Khylin Woodrow Airlines are really good at some things—like people movement, aircraft maintenance, and keeping passengers safe. They’re also experts at collecting vast mountains of customer data, including what sorts of credit cards and computers you use, how often you fly, and where and how much you spend on all the extras. If you’re stressing over a tight connection, flight attendants can usually tell you which gate to run toward, how much time you have, and whether your next flight is on time. But they may also know if you were stuck in Buffalo for six hours last week because of a delay, and offer a personal apology. They can even tap their data hoard to make sure there’s plenty of red for the 2 million-miler who drinks only cabernet, or upgrade the woman on standby who got stuck in economy because she usually flies first class. The swankiest hotels have long employed this strategy: If you feel special and loved, maybe you’ll come back. Now the airlines have jumped on the bandwagon. The industry has long envisioned a day when it could make use of all the information it’s accumulated on you. That data has traditionally been segregated in various IT systems, but now many airlines are gradually funneling it into a customer service strategy—with flight attendants becoming the face of hyper-personalized service. “We have enough data about who you are, where you fly, and more importantly, over the last period of time when we’ve delayed you, canceled you, made you change your seat, spilled coffee on you—we have the points of failure and the points of success,” Oscar Munoz, chief executive of United Continental Holdings Inc., said Nov. 9 at a conference sponsored by the New York Times. “I think our customers need better service and better personalization today. And that’s what we’re focusing on.” “If they know my birthday, what else do they know about me?” But as they probe these new capabilities, some carriers are confronting a nettlesome question: How much personal data can be used to enhance customer service before slipping into the “too much information” realm, where a traveler may feel uncomfortable? In April, Delta Air Lines Inc.’s 23,000 flight attendants began using new software called SkyPro on their Nokia Lumia mobile devices to keep tabs on some basic customer information. You’ll get an apology if your flight last week was delayed, for example. Or a thank you if you just hit 200,000 miles for the year. Or, say, a flight attendant spills some coffee on your skirt: The tools will allow him to award you some frequent flier miles or a future travel voucher on the spot. On the Nokia devices, each seat of a flight is color-coded. A green thumbs-up for passengers Delta wants to thank or congratulate, a red check if the airline wants to apologize for a recent service mishap. American Airlines Group Inc., the world’s largest carrier, equips its 24,000 flight attendants with Samsung Galaxy Note devices. Early next year, American will release a new app called iSolve to let flight attendants dispense frequent-flier miles or a travel voucher to help resolve customer service issues onboard. United’s flight attendants also track tight connections, mileage milestones and other customer matters with company-issued iPhones. “We want to stay one step ahead of them, if you will, by using our big data when things go wrong or when things are going great,” said Allison Ausband, Delta’s senior vice president of in-flight service. Like other carriers debating how to employ “big data” through new digital tools, Delta is exploring where the creepy factor lies in all this customer insight. For example, should a flight attendant wish you a happy birthday? What about appearing with a bloody mary because you ordered the drink on nine of your last 10 flights? What if you’re sitting beside your boss this time? And should flight attendants’ notes on high-value customers be updated and distributed companywide? Right now, they’re not, but what has begun as making use of information they had anyway could soon become a targeted accumulation of data on your travel persona.Do we want to feel like we’re under the microscope every time we fly? Will we order that second drink? Even watch a racy movie? Entertainment isn’t being tracked as of yet, but creating a big brother environment may not make for happy customers, which after all, is the point of the exercise. “It’s a feel-good thing, but it’s also in the mind of the consumer, ‘If they know my birthday, what else do they know about me?’” said John Romantic, American’s managing director of flight service. On Delta flights, there are no happy birthdays or unbidden cocktails—yet. The carrier is “gradually increasing the number of data elements the customer is comfortable with us interacting on,” Ausband said. The larger, more immediate goal is “to make sure they know that they do matter to us, whether they’re in 32B or sitting in 1A.” Mallory Brown, a 10-year Delta flight attendant, said customers have responded well to the apologies and thank yous she’s delivered. “They were impressed by it,” said Brown, who also helps develop the carrier’s on-board service curriculum. “It went so well that the surrounding passengers started talking about it.” Atlanta-based Delta considers its knowledge of customers’ preferences a “strategic advantage,” Ausband said. The airline is also trying to increase its number of daily “recognition events,” which vary based on flight duration and whether a route is more of a business or leisure market. “Throughout the cabin there are pockets of next-generation business travelers who are going to be high spenders” Delta is hardly alone when it comes to using its customer intelligence, with every big international airline exploring how to tailor its approach more specifically. Flight attendants at British Airways, part of the International Consolidated Airlines Group SA, have used iPads since 2011. The airline developed more than 40 apps for various customer service aspects of a journey, including those that allow cabin staff to recognize “high-tier customers,” spokeswoman Caroline Titmuss said. Via the iPads, a flight attendant can also note troubles—such as whether a specific meal order wasn’t delivered—so that the airline will offer an additional apology after the flight. Two years ago, Singapore Airlines Ltd. cabin crews began using tablets to customize their service and to create digital “voyage reports” after each flight. In this service landscape, many airlines will also grapple with how widely to distribute this kind of digital interaction. Is it wiser to focus on the “high-value” customers in premium cabins or attempt to include the entire airplane? Flight attendant time, after all, is a very finite resource. “We don’t think it’s either-or,” said Dave O’Flanagan, chief executive of Dublin-based Boxever Ltd., which sells customer service software and services for the travel industry. “That’s the way people have thought about the two previously. We’re pretty passionate about loyalty for everybody.” While business and first class make up the bulk of full-service airline profits, and not coincidentally accrue the most bespoke services, O’Flanagan contends that “throughout the cabin there are pockets of next-generation business travelers who are going to be high spenders.” One Asia airline that employs Boxever even plans to offer immediate upgrades if your luggage gets mislaid, O’Flanagan said, owing to the rapid evolution of bag-tracking technologies. As carriers develop greater proficiency in coordinating customer data, expect to see more personal apologies—and free drinks or bonus miles—awarded on board. You might even get a happy birthday wish—without mentioning your age, of course. “To the customer it says, ‘I matter,’” Ausband said. “‘I am sitting on this airplane with 200 people, but I matter.’”

https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/criminals-make-student-data-public-escalating-demands-ransom-n821066



by Stephanie Gosk, Michelle Melnick and Alyssa Newcomb
  In a world where everything is hackable and nothing off limits, cyber criminals are now targeting schools, stealing student data and holding it for ransom.   Last month, the U.S. Department of Education warned that hackers were targeting schools with weak cyber security and known vulnerabilities, threatening to release sensitive student information unless a ransom is paid.   "In some cases, this has included threats of violence, shaming, or bullying the children unless payment is received," the warning said.   Related: This 13-Year-Old Hacker Has Found Bugs at Some Top Tech Companies   Steve Bradshaw, school superintendent in Columbia Falls, Montana, a quiet town nestled at the foot of Glacier National Park, said he received messages in September from an anonymous person who mentioned "splattering blood all over the hallways."   Bradshaw turned over the alarming messages to local law enforcement.   "The threats were mostly about killing children -- and graphic ways that they were going to kill the children," Columbia Falls Police Chief Clint Peters told NBC News.   When it was evident that the person or group sending the messages was after a ransom in exchange for not releasing student social security numbers, phone numbers and addresses, law enforcement officials began trying to negotiate with the cyber criminals over their demands.   Particularly alarming was the discovery that the group had hacked the school's security cameras and could watch their every move.   After a rash of attacks across the country, the FBI is asking school districts to make cyber security a priority.   In Columbia Falls, Bradshaw's team met with families, consulted with the FBI, and ultimately made the decision to not pay the hackers.   That was followed by more threatening texts.   "It's about power and it's about fear," Bradshaw told NBC News. While he made the choice not to pay, he said he dreads the thought of the hackers dumping student information.   "Will they dump this information? Will they impact some child to the point that that child could be emotionally damaged for the rest of their life?" he said.   With many school districts across the country facing tight budgets, cyber security is often an after-thought, according to experts.   "Schools are vulnerable for a variety of reasons," said Shawn Henry, chief security officer of Crowdstrike and former assistant director of the FBI.   "First of all, their security is not always up to par and that's because they don't have a high budget in order to invest in security protocols," he said. "But they also have information that's of value and people want to protect children."   The Department of Education is encouraging schools to conduct security audits and to train staff on cyber security best practices, including how to avoid being targeted by social engineering schemes, such as fake emails that look real but, if clicked, can provide hackers access into the school's system.   Cyber security "needs to be a budget item every year," said Howard Marshall, a spokesman for the FBI. "At the end of the day, they are protecting the country's most important assest and resource - and that's our children."   But for now, parents like Amy Squires, the mother of a kindergarten student in Columbia Falls, are on edge about what the hackers' next move could be.   "Why is this happening to us?" she said. "A lot of us, as parents, are kind of wondering what's happening next."

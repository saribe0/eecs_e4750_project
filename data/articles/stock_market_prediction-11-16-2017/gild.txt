(NASDAQ:GILD) has been struggling since its earnings announcement in late October, even though the company beat revenue estimates by $110 million, beat earnings estimates by $0.14 per share and upgraded its EPS guidance from $0.86-$0.93 to $1.02-$1.77. To add insult to injury, the stock just got hit with another downgrade from Argus — who dropped the stock from Buy to Hold — citing concerns the company is increasing R&D spending on the new CART-T therapies the company acquired when it bought Kite Pharma at the same time its blockbuster hepatitis C and HIV products are seeing declining sales. These concerns, coupled with the general pricing pressure the market is applying to biotechnology stocks, are likely to push GILD lower. The stock is currently sitting around support at $72 (which was support in mid-August and resistance in late June), but we expect it to move down to its next support level at $69 (which was support in early July and resistance in early May). ‘Buy to open’ the GILD December 70 Put (GILD171215P00070000) for a maximum price of $1.50.

Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD) is an interesting player in the Healthcare space, with a focus on Biotechnology. The stock has been active on the tape, currently trading at $72.85, down from yesterday’s close by -1.25%. Given the stock’s recent action, it seemed like a good time to take a closer look at the company’s recent data. Fundamental Analysis Money managers are always interested in a company that can find the right recipe of fundamental data because it reflects something important going on underneath the surface. Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD) currently trades with a market capitalization of $95.14 Billion. That value represents a market adjusting for revenues that have been falling by -13.17 % on a quarterly year/year basis as of the company’s last quarterly report.

 The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For GILD, the company currently has $11.51 Billion of cash on the books, which is offset by $1.75 Billion current liabilities. You can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $12.1 Billion over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to grow in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $1.69 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 76.60% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors. Technical Analysis Sometimes, we can understand most about a stock by simply looking at how it has been trading. Looking at the stock’s movement on the chart, Gilead Sciences, Inc. recorded a 52-week high of $86.27. It is now trading 13.42% off that level. The stock is trading $80.29 its 50-day moving average by 7.44%. The stock carved out a 52-week low down at $63.76. In recent action, Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD) has made a move of -8.88% over the past month, which has come on Strong relative transaction volume. Over the trailing year, the stock is underperforming the S&P 500 by 19.32, and it’s gotten there by action that has been more volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. In terms of the mechanics underlying that movement, traders will want to note that the stock is trading on a float of 1.51% with $1.30 Billion sitting short, betting on future declines. That suggests something of the likelihood of a short squeeze in shares of GILD.

Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) is an interesting stock at present. Now trading with a market value of 92.92B, the company has a mix of catalysts and obstacles that spring from the nature of its operations. Everyone seems to have their own opinion of this stock. But what do the numbers really say? We think it’s a great time to take a fresh look. Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) Fundamentals That Matter It’s generally a good idea to start with the most fundamental piece of the picture: the balance sheet. The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For GILD, the company currently has 11.51 billion of cash on the books, which is offset by 1.75 billion in current liabilities. The trend over time is important to note. In this case, the company’s debt has been growing. The company also has 64.66 billion in total assets, balanced by 39.41 billion in total liabilities, which should give you a sense of the viability of the company under any number of imagined business contexts. Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD) saw 2.57 billion in free cash flow last quarter, representing a quarterly net change in cash of 2.8 billion. Perhaps most importantly where cash movements are concerned, the company saw about 2.69 billion in net operating cash flow.

 Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) Revenue Growth Potential As far as key trends that demonstrate something of the future investment potential of this stock, we need to take a closer look at the top line, first and foremost. Last quarter, the company saw 6.54 billion in total revenues. That represents a quarterly year/year change in revenues of -0.13 in sequential terms, the GILD saw sales decline by -0.08. But what about the bottom line? After all, that’s what really matters in the end. Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD) is intriguing when broken down to its core data. The cost of selling goods last quarter was 1.07 billion, yielding a gross basic income of 5.47 billion. For shareholders, given the total diluted outstanding shares of 1.32 billion, this means overall earnings per share of 2.06. Note, this compares with a consensus analyst forecast of 1.67 in earnings per share for its next fiscal quarterly report. 
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Is Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) Valuation Attractive Looking ahead at valuations, according to the consensus, the next fiscal year is forecast to bring about 6.72 in total earnings per share. If we consider a median price to earnings ratio on the stock, that corresponds with a stock price of 10.93. However, one should always remember: the trends are more important than the forecasts. This continues to be an interesting story, and we look forward to updating it again soon on Gilead Sciences, Inc.. 

http://www.usacommercedaily.com/2017/11/15/inspecting-more-closely-technicals-of-gilead-sciences-inc-gild-2/

With all other things going on, Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) has been on a free fall — declining -3 percent in just three months. It looks like traders are not happy with the stock. On the other side, analysts now consider Gilead Sciences, Inc. a neutral, and a technical analysis of the stock is setting somewhat neutral outlook for now.  Let’s talk about the gap between analyst price targets for the next 12 months and Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD)‘s current share price. Normally this spread should be in positive territory, indicating that analysts expect an investment’s value to increase over time. So is with Gilead Sciences, Inc.. The median target of analyst views collected by Yahoo Finance was as much as $13.85 below GILD’s recent stock price. That’s the optimistic view from Wall Street.  The stock has actually made sharp losses in the past year, as the company has gathered a -7.3% return in the past twelve months. But even with this move, there is still plenty of room for the company to come back from a longer term perspective, and especially if we look to recent lows for the company as well.  The company’s share price is down -21.25% from previous highs of around $86.27 per share on September 08, 2017. On the bright side, the company’s share price has been on the rebound, up more than 33.31% since hitting lows of $63.76 on June 16, 2017.  Finally, from a technical perspective, there’s a strong possibility that the stock could enter into a new bull market after finding strong support between $68.64 and $69.89. In terms of pullbacks, $72.56 level is the first resistance point. Technical analysis can help recognize key technical price levels in the stock. Investors can use these support and resistance levels to refine their entries and exits from stocks.  Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) price is pointing towards neither exit nor entry barriers, according to a technical analysis tool called the Relative Strength Index (RSI). Last session Gilead Sciences, Inc. RSI was seen at 23.69. RSI measures the speed and change of a stock price to warn investors when a stock’s momentum has carried it too far. An RSI reading above 80 indicates that a stock is overbought while anything below 20 is oversold.  With these kinds of figures it is worthy to note that Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD) has been put into a neutral territory, but there are few other spots to consider. The Stochastic %K for GILD is 13.67. Stochastics is a momentum indicator that uses basic support and resistance levels and integrates with the trend to give accurate buy or sell signals to traders. For stochastics, readings below 20 are considered oversold and you would only take buy signals if the indicator is below that level. A value of 80 is considered overbought and sell signals occurring below that level would be ignored. This leads to longer trades and should result in fewer losses.  14-day Williams %R for Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) moved to around 88.36. The interpretation of Williams %R is very similar to that of the stochastic oscillator, except that the stochastic oscillator has internal smoothing. The oscillator ranges from 0 to -100. No matter how fast a security advances or declines, Williams %R will always fluctuate within this range. Overbought and oversold levels can be used to identify unsustainable price extremes. Simply put, readings in the range of 80% to 100% indicate that the security is oversold while readings in the 0% to 20% range suggest it is overbought.

Sign up for our daily recaps of the ever-changing search marketing landscape. Google parent Alphabet announced third-quarter results. Both revenues and earnings per share beat Wall Street estimates. The company reported roughly $27.8 billion in total revenues (up 24 percent), with Google contributing all but $302 million of that amount. Earnings per share were $9.57, which was about $1.24 higher than expected. Advertising generated just over $24 billion in quarterly revenue. Operating income was about $7.8 billion. However, traffic acquisition costs (TAC) rose to $3.1 billion (vs. $2.6 billion a year ago). There are sure to be analyst questions about that item. The revenue breakdown by segment: Paid clicks on Google properties were up 6 percent year over year and aggregate cost per click (CPC) was up 1 percent. Here’s more detail: Paid click growth was significant. However, CPCs were down (18 percent) from a year ago but up slightly (1 percent) from last quarter. Alphabet (GOOG) shares are up in after-hours trading. The company says it now has more than 78,000 employees, compared with just under 70,000 a year ago. The earnings call webcast is happening now.

Time is a flat circle. Alphabet announced its third-quarter earnings today (Oct. 26), and yet again, it brought in a ton of cash, almost entirely from Google’s advertising business. The company generated $27.8 billion in revenue, up 24% from the same quarter last year, making this Alphabet’s highest-revenue quarter ever. (The previous record was $26.06 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016.) Roughly $24.1 billion of that revenue, or about 87%, came from Google’s ad sales. Alphabet reported $7.8 billion in profit for the quarter, up about 35% from the same period a year earlier. Most of the remainder of Alphabet’s revenue, about $3.4 billion, came from other revenue streams at Google, including hardware sales, cloud services, and sales of subscription services like YouTube TV and Google Play music, chief financial officer Ruth Porat said on the company’s earnings call. Just $302 million (around 1% of Alphabet’s revenue) came from sales from every other Alphabet company, lumped into the “Other Bets” bucket of its earnings. Analysts surveyed ahead of earnings had expected Alphabet to only bring in around $22 billion in revenue. The large beat saw the company’s Class A shares rising over $40 (about 4%) in after-hours trading. It remains to be seen whether investors will tire of Alphabet relying on the same old revenue sources. The company has been massively successful selling ads against search results on its own sites and apps, and selling ads on other companies’ websites. While those businesses show no signs of slowing, Alphabet has also invested billions into researching and developing a series of ambitious “moonshot” projects. It’s unclear whether those so-called Other Bets will ever be as important to Alphabet’s bottom line as its search engine has been. Those moonshots include self-driving cars at Waymo, internet-beaming balloons and delivery drones in the X research lab, defeating death at Calico, and myriad other companies. They have largely been money pits for Alphabet since the company spun them out from its core Google business in 2015. The only real revenue that’s come out of Other Bets to date has been hardware sales from Nest, Alphabet’s internet-of-things device company, and Fiber, its fiber-optic internet service.

Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) is an interesting player in the Technology space, with a focus on Internet Information Providers. The stock has been active on the tape, currently trading at $970.54, up from yesterday’s close by 0.22%. Given the stock’s recent action, it seemed like a good time to take a closer look at the company’s recent data. Fundamental Analysis This company has been competing with others in the Technology space and offers its own combination of interesting factors Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) currently trades with a market capitalization of $660.86 Billion. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For GOOG, the company currently has $15.61 Billion of cash on the books. You can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $25.21 Billion over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to grow in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $8.33 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 34.16% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors. Technical Analysis It’s important to check the technicals to get a sense of how GOOG has been acting. Looking at the stock’s movement on the chart, Alphabet Inc. recorded a 52-week high of $997.21. It is now trading 26.67% off that level. The stock is trading $944.26 its 50-day moving average by -26.28%. The stock carved out a 52-week low down at $727.54. In recent action, Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) has made a move of +4.94% over the past month, which has come on weak relative transaction volume. Over the trailing year, the stock is underperforming the S&P 500 by 19.89, and it’s gotten there by action that has been less volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. In terms of the mechanics underlying that movement, traders will want to note that the stock is trading on a float of 0.56% with $600.57 Million sitting short, betting on future declines. That suggests something of the likelihood of a short squeeze in shares of GOOG.

The run in big tech is far from over and, in addition to Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB), the big tech name I like most is Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). GOOG stock is trading a marked discount due to the less “sexy” nature of its growth pipeline. But that growth pipeline is stable, and might just get a big boost in the near future from the self-driving and cloud markets. Although many of Wall Street’s favorite tech names have posted explosive gains over the past 12 months, those same favorite tech stocks continue to rally to all-time highs. The latest bit of good news came from NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), the red-hot chip maker that just reported blowout numbers, underscoring that the shift to all-things-AI and all-things-cloud remains as strong as ever. Of course, NVDA’s blowout report comes on the heels of each one of the FANG stocks delivering blowout reports. All those stocks have made all-time highs over the past several weeks and months. All in all, big tech remains the sector to own in the stock market. We all know about the digital advertising growth story at GOOG. Alongside FB, GOOG dominates the digital advertising world. That is a good place to be, since there are still a ton of dollars in transit from traditional advertising mediums to digital advertising channels. This mass shift in advertising dollars is why GOOG’s advertising revenue growth rate is still accelerating (up 21% last quarter versus high-teens growth in the prior two quarters). But beyond the digital advertising growth narrative, GOOG has lesser-known catalysts which could drive GOOG stock materially higher in the long-term. Those growth catalysts are starting to come into the spotlight. Firstly, Google Cloud will start to gain significant market share in the cloud space thanks to Big Retail names ditching Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Big Retail is sending a clear message to Amazon right now: “you can’t have your cake and eat it, too.” Big Retail players don’t want to pay for a service provided by the very business which is stealing their sales and killing their margins. So they are dumping Amazon Web Services en masse. Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT) was the first to do so. Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) followed suit. Most recently, Kroger Co (NYSE:KR) bypassed Amazon for cloud investing.

The EU is preparing to fine Google (GOOG, GOOGL) with an antitrust penalty over AdSense, its advertising network, with a decision expected in the next few weeks, The Telegraph reports. It will be the second fine in less than a year. Google was ordered to pay €2.4B in June for abusing its internet search monopoly to promote its online shopping service. Now read: Alphabet Belongs Way Above $1,000 » 

http://www.cityam.com/275558/google-vs-brussels-another-europe-antitrust-fine-coming-us

Brussels is preparing to slap Google with another fine just months after a record $2.4bn penalty for anti-competitive behaviour when it was found to favour its own shopping services in search results. A separate antitrust investigation, this time involving its Adsense product, is expected to be wrapped up in the coming weeks with a fresh fine expected. But a third investigation by Europe's competition regulator into Google's Android operating system has been kicked into next year, the Telegraph reports.  Read more: EU competition chief welcomes “renewed” antitrust debate in Washington Conclusions to both investigations had been expected before the end of the year. Google is appealing against the record shopping search fine but has implemented new arrangements for displaying shopping search results to avoid further penalties. In the adsense case, the EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager last year issued what's known as a statement of objectives outlining how it believes it protected its dominant position in online search advertising. It said it believes Google reduced choice by preventing third-party websites from sourcing search ads from competitors to Google. Read more: Intel claims a victory against EU over €1bn antitrust fine Analysts believe a fine in the Android case, which was also laid out by the European Commission last year, could surpass $6bn. According to the newspaper report, the EC is doubling down on due diligence that will take it into next year. Vestager has been firm with US tech titans, moving quickly on several cases under her watch. However, she was struck a blow in September after a decade-long battle resulted in Intel succeeding in its appeal against a then record fine handed down in 2009. The case was referred back to a lower court by the European Court of Justice to be heard again. Google had not responded to a request for comment at the time of publication.

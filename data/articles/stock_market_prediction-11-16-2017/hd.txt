Eighteen players from the Turkey Bowl-bound H.D. Woodson football team and seven players from Eastern were suspended for one game after an on-field brawl in their Nov. 11 game, D.C. Schools Chancellor Antwan Wilson announced Wednesday. Eastern’s season is over as the Ramblers did not qualify for postseason play. Woodson, however, is set to play Ballou in the Turkey Bowl, the D.C. Interscholastic Athletic Association title game, on Thanksgiving Day. The suspended players will not be eligible for that game against Ballou, Wilson said. Eastern’s suspended players will sit out the first game of the 2018 season. “I think emotions got carried away and students did some things they’d like to take back,” Wilson said at a Thursday news conference. “Football is a contact sport, but we can’t have fighting.” Woodson senior running back Mychale Salahuddin, who verbally committed to play college football at Southern California, was tackled well out of bounds after a carry in the first half. He shoved the Eastern defender after the play, and another pushed back. Players from the Woodson sideline converged on the group around the five yard-line.  After reviewing film of the altercation, DCPS athletic department personnel identified the players involved. Several other Woodson players who left the Warriors’ bench area but did not participate in the scrum will not face discipline, Wilson said. He declined to name the suspended student-athletes, citing their right to appeal the school system’s ruling.  “This decision is the unfortunate result of unsportsmanlike conduct,” Diana Parente, DCIAA’s executive director, wrote in a letter to Woodson students and parents. “The DCIAA staff, the H.D. Woodson High School football coaches, and DCPS officials are committed to working with the players involved to help prevent incidents like this in the future. The safety of our student athletes is paramount at all times.” The Turkey Bowl will be played at Eastern at 11 a.m. on Nov. 23.

 WASHINGTON (WUSA9) - The DCPS School Chancellor announced Wednesday, 18 H.D. Woodson High School football players are now suspended from the 2017 Turkey Bowl.  The suspension comes after a fight involving Eastern Senior High School during a football game last week. Nine Eastern players are also facing a one-game suspension. However, there's a difference. 
 
 Eastern Senior High School is done for the season so the players will have to sit out of a game next year. For the 18 Woodson players suspended, their next game is next week's Turkey Bowl. There is a video of the fight.  In the video, you can see the Woodson player with the ball. He's running towards out-of-bounds when an Eastern player goes into him. They end up on the ground, and that's when the fight starts. It was all on the Woodson side of the field. A lot of their players ran over.  Woodson was winning significantly when the fight broke out, sources said. H.D. Woodson High School has been the reigning Turkey Bowl Champ for the past 4-years, according to parents, and previous reports. After learning of the suspension, more than one parent echoed the same: they think it's intentional.  "I can't say collusion because I can't prove it … but you know, if it walks like a duck," said one parent who asked we not show his face. He said he is the father of a Woodson player not suspended and was also at the game in question. He also holds the referees and the Eastern team responsible. "They were provoking fights throughout the game – from late hits until penalties that should've been called," said the Football dad. The DCPS Chancellor, Antwan Wilson, said they looked at which players were fighting and which left their designated area to get involved.  Wilson believes all the athletes are 'good kids' who made poor judgment. He also said, "I think the punishment or the consequences that we've given are just in accordance with what comes when you fight in a game." The football dad said all teams were warned before of fighting before last week's game, but he still called it a disservice. "...A reflection of how much hate there is at Woodson winning 5-straight turkey bowls because that's never been done before," the dad told WUSA9.  Wilson said the game would go on so that the players who weren't fighting will not be punished as well. The players suspended from both teams will get the chance to appeal before the Turkey Bowl is played, sources said. © 2017 WUSA-TV To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the  Conversation Guidelines and FAQs

As a homeowner, I frequent Home Depot Inc (NYSE:HD) stores at least once a month. My visits are consistently disappointing from the customer service perspective. There used to be a time when the in-store reps walked you over to the area you seek. Now, all I get is a pointed finger in the general direction. Nevertheless, they usually have what I need and if I do enough homework online ahead of time, I end up buying it at HD stores. So I’ve rarely bought my home improvement needs online … Yet! So Home Depot is still my go-to place for now. Fundamentally, and from a business perspective, I like how management runs the company. With a 24 price-to-earnings ratio, the stock is priced in line with the sector. Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW), is cheaper from a book value perspective, yet I prefer trading HD. This morning, management reported earnings and beat expectations. They also raised guidance. Yet, Wall Street cannot decide if they love it or hate it. The stock is teetering about the flat line. Since they didn’t change any of the fundamentals, I am optimistic HD for the long term. Coming into the earnings, HD stock had been up 23% year-to-date. LOW was only up 9% so clearly I am not the only trader who favors HD. I do enjoy the LOW shopping trips better perhaps because I am not a professional construction guy and they cater to the retail clients slightly better than HD. Technically, even though Home Depot stock has rallied so much it has established several layers of support. And therein lies my opportunity. Back in February, the stock had a clear breakout and the bulls haven’t looked back since. This is strength I can bet on.

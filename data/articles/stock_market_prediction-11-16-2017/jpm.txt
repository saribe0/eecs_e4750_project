 About a month has gone by since the last earnings report for JP Morgan Chase & Co JPM  . Shares have added about 1.6% in that time frame, outperforming the market. Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.  JPMorgan Q3 Earnings Beat Despite Trading Weakness  makeArticleAd();  Amid an expected trading slump, rising rates and loan growth drove JPMorgan third-quarter 2017 earnings of $1.76 per share, which easily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.67. Also, the figure reflects an 11% rise from the year-ago period. Notably, the results included a legal benefit of $107 million.    Solid loan growth (driven mainly by improved credit card loans) and higher interest rates supported net interest income. Further, rise in advisory fees supported top-line growth. A slight fall in operating expenses acted as a tailwind.    As expected, fixed income and equity trading slumped during the quarter. Likewise, underwriting fees (both equity and fixed income) witnessed a fall. Also, a decline in mortgage banking income, due to higher funding costs and fall in mortgage origination volume, was a headwind.    Apart from these, results were adversely impacted by an increase in provision for credit losses, mainly due to reserve build in Card portfolio.    The overall performance of JPMorgan's business segments, in terms of net income generation, was decent. All segments, except Corporate & Investment Bank, reported a rise in net income on a year-over-year basis.    Among other positives, both credit card sales volume and merchant processing volume grew 13%. Further, both Commercial Banking average loan balances and Asset Management average loan balances rose 10%.   Trading Slump Offset by Higher Rates & Loan Growth, Costs Down    Managed net revenues of $26.2 billion in the quarter were up 3% from the year-ago quarter. Also, it compared favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $25.7 billion. Rising rates and loan growth were the primary reasons for the top-line improvement. These were partially offset by lower trading revenues, investment banking fees and mortgage banking fees.    Non-interest expenses (on managed basis) were $14.3 billion, down 1% from the year-ago quarter. The fall was primarily driven by lower marketing costs and stable compensation expenses, partially offset by technology, communications and equipment costs.   Credit Quality Worsens    Provision for credit losses increased 14% year over year to $1.5 billion, primarily due to reserve build in Consumer loan portfolio. Also, net charge-offs were up 13% year over year to $1.3 billion.    However, as of Sep 30, 2017, non-performing assets were $6.2 billion, down 21% from the year-ago period.   Strong Capital Position    Tier 1 capital ratio (estimated) was 14.3% as of Sep 30, 2017 compared with 13.6% as of Sep 30, 2016. Tier 1 common equity capital ratio (estimated) was 12.6% as of Sep 30, 2017, up from 12.0% as of Sep 30, 2016. Total capital ratio came in at 16.1% (estimated) as of Sep 30, 2017 compared with 15.1% as of Sep 30, 2016.    Book value per share was $66.95 as of Sep 30, 2017 compared with $63.79 as of Sep 30, 2016. Tangible book value per common share came in at $54.03 as of Sep 30, 2017 compared with $51.23 as of Sep 30, 2016.   Outlook    For 2017, the company projects NII to increase about $4 billion. Management expects margin expansion to continue over the next several quarters driven by higher rates and deposit re-pricing.    Expect card, commerce solutions and auto division, CCB segment revenue in the fourth quarter 2017 is expected to be relatively flat sequentially as higher net interest income will be offset by the anniversary net impact of Sapphire reserve.    With no change expected in the overall volatility in the fourth quarter, Markets revenues are projected to decline year over year.    Management expects investment banking (IB) fees in the second half of 2017 to be down y/y, as the company had the highest IB fees on record in third quarter 2016. Nonetheless, overall sentiment remains positive with the company expecting equity issuance to continue (given the stable market backdrop) and the M&A backlog to be healthy with conditions remaining beneficial for refinancing activities.    For 2017, management expects adjusted expenses to be nearly $58 billion.    The company expects expenses in CB segment to remain relatively stable on a sequential basis.    Management projects average core loan growth to be around 8% in 2017 that will be funded from strong deposit balance.    For 2017, JPMorgan expects NCOs rate to be relatively flat across all businesses except Cards (up due to continued loan growth and the seasoning of newer vintages) and CIB (down on absence of energy related NCOs). Notably, NCOs are projected to be around $5 billion (excluding NCOs related to the student loan portfolio write-down in the first quarter 2017), driven by loan growth.    Management expects credit card charge-offs to be slightly below 3% for 2017 and in the higher end of 3-3.25% in 2018.    Consumer allowance for credit losses will likely increase $300 million in 2017, owing to growth across businesses, partly offset by allowance releases for the residential real estate portfolio. Further, wholesale allowance for credit losses (excluding energy and metals & mining portfolios) is expected to rise modestly. Management expects potential reserve releases in energy portfolio in the upcoming quarters, reflecting stabilizing  oil prices  .  How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?  It turns out, fresh estimates flatlined during the past month. There has been one revision higher for the current quarter compared to one lower.

The shares of Verizon Communications Inc. have decreased by more than -17.37% this year alone. The shares recently went down by -0.25% or -$0.11 and now trades at $44.11. The shares of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), has jumped by 13.79% year to date as of 11/14/2017. The shares currently trade at $98.19 and have been able to report a change of 0.56% over the past one week. The stock of Verizon Communications Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. were two of the most active stocks on Tueday. Investors seem to be very interested in what happens to the stocks of these two companies but do investors favor one over the other? We will analyze the growth, profitability, risk, valuation, and insider trends of both companies and see which one investors prefer. Next 5Y EPS Growth: 1.27% versus 8.81% When a company is able to grow consistently in terms of earnings at a high compound rate have the highest likelihood of creating value for its shareholders over time. Analysts have predicted that VZ will grow it’s earning at a 1.27% annual rate in the next 5 years. This is in contrast to JPM which will have a positive growth at a 8.81% annual rate. This means that the higher growth rate of JPM implies a greater potential for capital appreciation over the years. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Profitability and Returns Growth alone cannot be used to see if the company will be valuable. Shareholders will be the losers if a company invest in ventures that aren’t profitable enough to support upbeat growth. In order for us to accurately measure profitability and return, we will be using the EBITDA margin and Return on Investment (ROI), which balances the difference in capital structure. VZ has an EBITDA margin of 36.77%, this implies that the underlying business of JPM is more profitable. The ROI of VZ is 15.10% while that of JPM is 5.90%. These figures suggest that VZ ventures generate a higher ROI than that of JPM. Cash Flow  
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 The value of a stock is ultimately determined by the amount of cash flow that the investors have available. Over the last 12 months, VZ’s free cash flow per share is a positive 0.55, while that of JPM is positive 0. Liquidity and Financial Risk The ability of a company to meet up with its short-term obligations and be able to clear its longer-term debts is measured using Liquidity and leverage ratios. The debt ratio of VZ is 4.38 compared to 1.24 for JPM. VZ can be able to settle its long-term debts and thus is a lower financial risk than JPM. Valuation VZ currently trades at a forward P/E of 11.44, a P/B of 6.71, and a P/S of 1.45 while JPM trades at a forward P/E of 12.85, a P/B of 1.49, and a P/S of 5.52. This means that looking at the earnings, book values and sales basis, VZ is the cheaper one. It is very obvious that earnings are the most important factors to investors, thus analysts are most likely to place their bet on the P/E. Analyst Price Targets and Opinions The mistake some people make is that they think a cheap stock has more value to it. In order to know the value of a stock, there is need to compare its current price to its likely trading price in the future. The price of VZ is currently at a -12.57% to its one-year price target of 50.45. Looking at its rival pricing, JPM is at a -1.91% relative to its price target of 100.10. This figure implies that over the next one year, JPM is a better investment. When looking at the investment recommendation on say a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell), VZ is given a 2.70 while 2.50 placed for JPM. This means that analysts are more bullish on the outlook for VZ stocks. Insider Activity and Investor Sentiment Short interest or otherwise called the percentage of a stock’s tradable shares currently being shorted is another data that investors use to get a handle on sentiment. The short ratio for VZ is 2.47 while that of JPM is just 2.41. This means that analysts are more bullish on the forecast for JPM stock. Conclusion The stock of JPMorgan Chase & Co. defeats that of Verizon Communications Inc. when the two are compared, with JPM taking 6 out of the total factors that were been considered. JPM happens to be more profitable, generates a higher ROI, has higher cash flow per share, higher liquidity and has a lower financial risk. When looking at the stock valuation, JPM is the cheaper one on an earnings, book value and sales basis. Finally, the sentiment signal for JPM is better on when it is viewed on short interest.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) has became attention seeker from the inquisitor when it experienced a change of 0.95% Whereas, in last 21 trading days was 0.58% and moved up in last 63 trading days of 8.32%.

Every trader dreams of taking a small amount of capital and becoming a millionaire off of it. The reality is that it is unlikely to occur by trading a small account. While profits can accumulate and compound over time, traders with small accounts often feel pressured to use large amounts of leverage or take on excessive risk in order to build up their accounts quickly. Not realizing that professional fund managers often make less than 10-15% per year, traders with small accounts often assume they can make double, triple or even 10 times their money in a single year. A strategy doesn’t need to win all the time to be profitable. Many traders only win 50% to 60% of their trades. The point is, they make more on their winners than they lose on their losers. Make sure that the risk on each trade is limited to a specific percentage of the account, and that entry and exit methods are clearly defined and written down. There are times when the stock markets test your nerves. As a day trader you need to learn to keep greed, hope and fear at bay. Decisions should be governed by logic and not emotion. One strategy is to set two stop losses: Analytical Significance of Simple Moving Average The SMA200 of the stock is at 8.14%, SMA20 is -1.50%, while SMA50 is 1.80%. JPM’s relative volume was 1.31. Relative volume is a great indicator to keep a close eye on, but like most indicators it works best in conjunction with other indicators and on different time frames. Higher relative volume you will have more liquidity in the stock which will tighten spreads and allow you to trade with more size without a ton of slippage. JPM’s overall volume in the last trading session was 15,366,179 shares. Important Technical Indicators to keep in Focus:- A statistical measure of the dispersion of returns (volatility) for JPM producing salvation in Investors mouth, it has week volatility of 1.53% and for the month booked as 1.28%. Regardless of which metric you utilize, a firm understanding of the concept of volatility and how it is measured is essential to successful investing. A stock that maintains a relatively stable price has low volatility. When investing in a volatile security, the risk of success is increased just as much as the risk of failure.  JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s beta is 1.21 whilst the stock has an average true range (ATR) of 1.41. Other technical indicators are worth considering in assessing the prospects for EQT. RSI for instance is currently at 48.85. It is common practice for investors to use the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio or price multiple) to determine if a company’s stock price is over or undervalued. Companies with a high P/E ratio are typically growth stocks. However, their relatively high multiples do not necessarily mean their stocks are overpriced and not good buys for the long term. The PEG ratio shows us that, when compare to the beer company, the always-popular tech company doesn’t have the growth rate to justify its higher P/E, and its stock price appears overvalued. JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s currently has a PEG ratio of 1.60 where as its P/E ratio is 14.08. The company P/S (price to Sales) ratio is 5.52, P/B (price to Book) ratio is 1.49, while its P/C (price to Cash) ratio stands at 0.29. Should You Go With High Insider Ownership? Many value investors look for stocks with a high percent of insider ownership, under the theory that when management are shareholders, they will act in its own self interest, and create shareholder value in the long-term. This aligns the interests of shareholders with management, thus benefiting everyone. While this sounds great in theory, high insider ownership can actually lead to the opposite result, a management team that is unaccountable because they can keep their jobs under almost any circumstance. Currently JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM)’s shares owned by insiders are 0.10%, whereas shares owned by institutional owners are 76.40%. November 16, 2017 November 16, 2017 November 16, 2017

Photographer: Michael Nagle/Bloomberg It took Jennifer Sharkey more than eight years to get a trial over her dismissal from JPMorgan Chase & Co. A Manhattan jury needed only five hours to find the former wealth manager was fired illegally and award her $1.13 million in damages. Then, it took just an hour for a Manhattan judge to upend the verdict and send the whole case back to square one. A jury of five women and three men found that the bank retaliated by firing Sharkey after she recommended the dumping of a client whom she suspected of fraud and money laundering. The panel rejected the bank’s claim that Sharkey was dismissed because she lied to her boss on multiple occasions. Sharkey was awarded $563,000 in back pay and $563,000 for emotional damage. That was before lunch on Tuesday. A little more than an hour later, U.S. District Judge Denise Cote said she’ll likely order a new trial if the two sides don’t hammer out a settlement because the verdict is "substantially flawed." "The award of emotional damages says to me that the jury was prejudiced against the bank," Cote said after JPMorgan Chase asked her to throw out the jury verdict. "That undermines the entire verdict." Both sides declined to comment after the hearing. Sharkey claimed she was let go in 2009 after telling her superiors she planned to recommend that JPMorgan Chase end its relationship with a client who had about $14 million at the bank. She testified she was worried the diamond seller who had also founded a phone calling-card business might have been involved in fraud and money laundering. “I was fired the next day,” Sharkey testified in Manhattan federal court. The case marked a rare trial of Sarbanes-Oxley whistle-blower claims in a dispute that got its start in the months following the discovery that Bernard Madoff used JPMorgan Chase bank accounts in his Ponzi scheme. Because of a pretrial ruling by the judge, Sharkey wasn’t allowed to testify about client-screening procedures at JPMorgan Chase in the wake of the Madoff fraud. "Of course I’m very happy -- 8 1/2 years," Sharkey said before the jury’s verdict was thrown into question by the judge. Sharkey got her day -- a week, actually -- in court after years of delays, including two appeals that reinstated her claims. A judge who said at a pretrial hearing that he’d “do anything to get rid of this case” withdrew from the case and was replaced with Cote. Jurors were forced to contend with an alphabet soup of letters that stood in for the names of people and companies. The client who raised Sharkey’s suspicions, for example, was referred to as Client A to protect his identity. Other characters in the story were given the names Client H, Manager T and Client BW. Sharkey’s former boss, Leslie Lassiter, testified that she lied numerous times when asked if she’d contacted the office of another client and that was the reason for her firing. The client’s office manager called to complain that Sharkey hadn’t returned calls and asked whether the wealth manager was just “a phantom," according to Lassiter. The trial quickly turned into a personal battle between Sharkey’s story and Lassiter’s. Each side accused the other’s star witness of lying. Two JPMorgan Chase executives, Joe Kenney and Adam Green, were found by the jury not liable, conclusions the judge said she would leave intact. Cote said she believed the fact the jury awarded the same amount in emotional damages as in back pay meant they were in fact trying to award punitive damages, against her instructions. She said she believed the evidence showed that Sharkey was fired for lying and that a rational jury couldn’t have found that she reasonably believed the diamond broker violated any laws, such as money laundering or fraud, spelled out in the Sarbanes-Oxley protections. "It’s with sadness that I make these findings because I know you have all been engaged in a very long journey here," Cote said. The bank’s legal team reacted with hugs and backslaps. The case is Sharkey v. JPMorgan Chase & Co., 10-cv-03824, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) has been a major beneficiary of the stock market rally following the 2016 election. Since this time last year, shares of the New York City-based bank are up 44%. That's more than twice the S&P 500. It also comes in ahead of other large-cap banks, with the KBW Bank Index returning 38% over the same stretch. Given this performance, it's reasonable for investors to ask this question: Is JPMorgan Chase's stock cheap or expensive? Image source: Getty Images. A common way to measure a bank stock's valuation is to use the price-to-book value ratio, which is calculated by dividing a bank's share price by its book value per share. This tells you how much investors think a bank is worth relative to how much the bank purports to be worth on its balance sheet. A bank with a ratio above 1.0 is said to trade for a premium to book value. The implication is that investors think the bank will create value beyond its current net worth. Conversely, a bank that trades for less than book value per share is said to trade at a discount to book value. This implies that investors expect the bank's value to erode -- perhaps as a result of excess unrecognized loan losses. Data source: YCharts.com. Chart by author. In the case of JPMorgan Chase, its stock trades for 1.49 times its book value per share. That equates to a 49% premium to book value. Despite this, compared to other bank stocks, JPMorgan Chase stock doesn't come across as expensive. The median valuation on the KBW Bank Index is 1.41 times book value, or only eight basis points less than JPMorgan Chase. Data source: YCharts.com. Chart by author. A second way to measure a bank's valuation is to use the price-to-earnings ratio, or P/E ratio. You calculate this by dividing a bank's share price by its earnings per share. The P/E ratio reflects how much it costs an investor to buy $1 worth of a company's earnings. If the P/E ratio is 20, then it costs $20. If the ratio is 9, it costs $9. There is no general industry benchmark in terms of what constitutes a high or low P/E ratio for a bank stock. That said, one can compare a bank stock's P/E ratio to stocks that are both within the bank industry and outside of it; this is a key benefit of the P/E ratio over the price-to-book value ratio. *The median was used for the KBW Bank Index and the S&P 500. Data source: YCharts.com, The Wall Street Journal. Chart by author. In JPMorgan Chase's case, its stock trades for 14.2 times its earnings over the trailing 12 months. That compares to a median P/E ratio on the S&P 500, an index of large-cap stocks, of 23.2. The median on the KBW Bank Index is 16.8. By this measure, then, JPMorgan Chase's stock seems cheap, at least on a relative basis. While bank stocks like JPMorgan Chase may not have rich valuations right now, that doesn't mean they can't drop by a large margin; they can. One could make the argument, in fact, that stocks more broadly are in jeopardy of a correction right now, given the multiyear bull market in equities since the financial crisis. But holding all else equal, if you're going to buy a bank stock in this environment, it doesn't hurt to buy one like JPMorgan Chase, which has a reputation for being superbly managed and which trades at a reasonable valuation.

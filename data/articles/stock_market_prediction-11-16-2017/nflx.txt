I grew up under a barrage of brainwashing, overstimulating commercials. Streaming services offer the next generation a neurological reprieve. You don’t have to say it — kids these days watch way too much TV. According to a 2016 Nielsen report, children between the ages of 2 and 11 watch even more than teens, clocking 23 hours of television every week. There is no doubt that I would prefer my son to get outside. But if you’re going to have some TV time in your home, the Internet has brought us a silver lining: streaming services with almost zero ads. It’s trendy to say that all media and entertainment are bad for everybody — and there’s certainly a lot of low-brow programming out there to support that theory. But as someone who’s built his career in technology and communication, I won’t accept going off the grid as a solution. I want to help my son see both the incredible value and significant dangers of television and media so that he has the tools and experience to navigate an increasingly connected world. Enter Netflix, an accidental solution to television’s relentless barrage of commercial interruptions. When I was growing up in the ’80s and ’90s, we flipped through the channels and watched whatever was on. Without fail, that included about 12 minutes of extremely loud, extremely catchy 30-second commercial spots every hour. These ads were so ubiquitous that they often overshadowed the shows themselves in our collective consciousness, the jingles and jokes becoming joyful childhood memories right alongside “Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.” If you’re doubting your exposure, feast your eyes on this hour-long compilation of ’90s commercials for kids. I specifically remember many of these and can sing along with almost every one. When you’re done reminiscing, consider the brain cells wasted on all those rhymes, slogans and songs. And remind yourself that every one of these ads is specifically, neurologically designed to stick to a child’s brain. We use music and rhyme to teach them good stuff, and advertisers use the same techniques to get them begging for Cookie Crisp. We can debate the value of any particular show, but I think we can all agree there are at least a handful of wholesome, educational, modern options for kids who watch TV. There will always be some merchandising — Daniel Tiger is a great teacher, and you can also buy his doll at Target — but Netflix and its competitors have done us an incredible, largely accidental service by allowing us to deliver television to our kids with minimal distraction and brainwashing from ads. Today, when my son sees an ad, it’s a bizarre experience. A friend of mine has a fun routine with his daughter, where they jump up, mute the TV, and run around the room screaming “Ad!” every time a commercial plays. The fact that we can view television advertising as an aberration rather than the norm is one of the greatest benefits of the on-demand Internet age. A great television show can teach us something, can help us bond, and if nothing else, can simply be a time to relax and enjoy one of the many amenities of the modern world. Say what you will about the value of a Netflix binge, but the fact that it has untethered us from broadcast schedules and the overwhelm of ads has made my world a better place. And someday decades from now, if somebody creates a compilation of 2017’s best commercials for kids, my son will be seeing them all for the first time.

Source: Shutterstock Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has reached a plateau. After periods of seemingly continuous increases, NFLX stock has remained flat for the last month. Though the success of homegrown programming such as Stranger Things and its move into 190 countries throughout the world has bolstered the stock, the equity now faces many threats. Given a high valuation and its competitive threats, investors would be wise to avoid this stock for now.
A sell recommendation on this article comes with mixed feelings. As I pointed out in September, Netflix has enjoyed an ever-growing stock bolstered by 20 years of mostly correct strategic decisions. And as our won Robert Waldo pointed out, when people are using “Netflix” as a verb meaning to watch streamed content, it’s a clear indication that NFLX and its offerings have become an integral part of millions of lives. With solid management and a great programming lineup, it is little wonder this service, and by extension NFLX stock, remains popular. Still, challenges remain. The most serious challenge for the company involves formidable competitors arising, namely Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS).
Having Disney pull its content from Netflix to start their streaming service serves as a blow to the platform. Netflix’s moat is not wide or deep enough to block Disney. With its classic movies dating as far back as the 1930s, Pixar, and the Star Wars franchise, Disney offers a library of time-tested content with which NFLX cannot compete. However, this does not mean Disney will destroy Netflix. NFLX produces great content of its own, the latest being Stranger Things 2. It is this content upon which Netflix’s moat was built and allowed them to stay on top of competition from Hulu, Prime from Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and HBO Now from Time Warner Inc (NYSE:TWX).
Moreover, NFLX has a history of defeating the competition. The company ran Blockbuster LLC out of business through mail order movies and later streaming. Additionally, the company undercut cable providers, calling into question the viability of offerings from Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) and AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T). Still, another issue with the company is the NFLX stock price itself. The equity trades in the $190s per share. This price has NFLX stock trading at almost 200 times earnings, eight times sales and over 25 times book value. The sales and book value metrics exceed that of even Amazon.

It’s worth it to have a look at Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) as there may be a chasm between the bulls and the bears as far as recent trading activity goes. Now trading with a market value of 83.91B, the company has a mix of catalysts and obstacles that spring from the nature of its operations. As the day-to-day narrative ebbs and flows for this company, it is more important than ever to step back and get a bird’s eye view of the fundamental reality under the surface of this story. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) Fundamentals That Matter It’s generally a good idea to start with the most fundamental piece of the picture: the balance sheet. The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For NFLX, the company currently has 1.75 billion of cash on the books. The trend over time is important to note. In this case, the company’s debt has been growing. The company also has 16.95 billion in total assets, balanced by 13.62 billion in total liabilities, which should give you a sense of the viability of the company under any number of imagined business contexts. Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) saw -453.57 million in free cash flow last quarter, representing a quarterly net change in cash of -172.31 million. Perhaps most importantly where cash movements are concerned, the company saw about -419.61 million in net operating cash flow.

 Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) Revenue Growth Potential As far as key trends that demonstrate something of the future investment potential of this stock, we need to take a closer look at the top line, first and foremost. Last quarter, the company saw 2.98 billion in total revenues. That represents a quarterly year/year change in revenues of 0.30 in sequential terms, the NFLX saw sales decline by 0.07. But what about the bottom line? After all, that’s what really matters in the end. Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) is intriguing when broken down to its core data. The cost of selling goods last quarter was 1.99 billion, yielding a gross basic income of 991.88 million. For shareholders, given the total diluted outstanding shares of 447.36 million, this means overall earnings per share of 0.29. Note, this compares with a consensus analyst forecast of 0.42 in earnings per share for its next fiscal quarterly report. 
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Is Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) Valuation Attractive Looking ahead at valuations, according to the consensus, the next fiscal year is forecast to bring about 2.29 in total earnings per share. If we consider a median price to earnings ratio on the stock, that corresponds with a stock price of 87.31. However, one should always remember: the trends are more important than the forecasts. This continues to be an interesting story, and we look forward to updating it again soon on Netflix, Inc..

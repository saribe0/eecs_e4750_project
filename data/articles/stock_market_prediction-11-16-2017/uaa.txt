Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Under Armour, Inc. UAA, which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further confirms weakness in UAA.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen 19 estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from 37 cents a share a month ago to its current level of 21 cents.Also, for the current quarter, Under Armour has seen 17 downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 2 cents a share from 21 cents over the past 30 days.   The stock has also seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 24.4% in the past month.

https://www.adn.com/sports/uaa-athletics/2017/11/15/busy-week-for-seawolves-include-home-contests-in-five-sports/

 It's a busy week for the Seawolves. Five teams are in action at home, and another is heading to the national championships.  From the nordic ski team's season debut to the hockey team's return from a month on the road to the volleyball team's season finale to a packed weekend of basketball, it's that time of year where some sports are wrapping up and others are just beginning.  Here's a look at what's going on in UAA sports this week.  The volleyball team kept its postseason hopes alive by jumping two spots, from ninth to seventh, in the latest NCAA Division II West Region rankings released Wednesday.  The jump came after the team went 2-0 last week and beat instate rival UAF in four sets Tuesday.  It's a vital leap for a team hoping to make its fifth straight appearance in the eight-team West Region tournament, which doubles as the beginning of the NCAA tournament.  UAA (19-9, 14-5 Great Northwest Athletic Conference) will conclude its regular season Thursday against Montana State-Billings (8-20, 4-14) at the Alaska Airlines Center.  "We have to take care of business tomorrow," UAA coach Chris Green said Wednesday. "I think a loss against a team that doesn't have a winning record would be a huge hurt to us.  "We have to concentrate on the game tomorrow and then we'll have the whole weekend to get ready for whatever is to come next."  Last week the UAA men's basketball team hosted the Alasaka/Hawaii Challenge. This week, it's the women's turn to host a tournament.  The No. 4 Seawolves host the Seawolf Hoops Classic on Friday and Saturday at the Alaska Airlines Center with Western State, UAF and Holy Names coming to town.  The UAA women (2-0) and men (0-2) both play Holy Names on Friday and both teams are receiving their best play in the paint.  The women are led by junior forward Hannah Wandersee, who tallied career highs of 24 points and 11 rebounds in a Friday win over Hawaii Pacific and added a team-high 16 points in a win over Cal State-L.A.  "She had a really good summer and she's just a really hard worker," UAA coach Ryan McCarthy said. "We're very pleasantly surprised with the kind of production she's had."  Forward Jacob Lamkpin leads a UAA men's team still looking for its first regular season win of the season. The senior transfer from University of the Pacific led UAA with double-doubles of 12 points and 10 rebounds in a Friday loss to Hawaii Pacific and 16 points and 10 rebounds in a Saturday loss to Chaminade.  West Region champion Caroline Kurgat and the fourth-ranked UAA women's cross-country running team head to the Division II national championships this week looking for more hardware.  The Seawolves will run in their 10th consecutive national championship on Saturday in Evansville, Indiana. They qualified by finishing second in the West Region meet earlier this month.  Kurgat, a senior from Eldoret, Kenya, will be among the favorites. She placed third at last year's championships.  "It's the national championship. I guess that's all we have to say about that," UAA coach Michael Friess said. "Our women's team has been training very well after a very successful regional meet.  "A good group of upperclassmen (is) going to go down there and challenge. Certainly a top-10 team, and if they run well, they could be a top-5 team and maybe even bring home a trophy."  The UAA men's team failed to qualify for nationals for the first time in 10 seasons, but will be represented by All-American Edwin Kangogo, who finished sixth at regionals.  UAA's nordic skiers get to don their skis for the first time in a collegiate competition this weekend when they host the Alaska Nordic Cup on Saturday and Sunday.  Saturday will feature 10K men's and 7.5K women's classic races at Hatcher Pass. A mixed relay will take place Sunday at either Hatcher Pass or Kincaid Park, depending on conditions.  UAA nordic coach Andrew Kastning said UAA, UAF and APU skiers will compete. He expects some top high school and club skiers to sign up too.  "I think we're looking forward to that first competition to gauge where we're at and what we need to do moving forward into the winter," Kastning said. "We've been building on our exercise and training since the beginning of the summer and every skier is getting anxious, wondering how it went."  With this week's signing of Grace Christian guard Tobin Karlberg, men's basketball coach Rusty Osborne continued a tradition of landing Class 3A Players of the Year.  Osborne's recruits over the years include five other players with the 3A award on their resume:  Lonnie Ridgeway of Heritage Christian, Carl Arts of Valdez, Kyle Fossman of Haines, Christian Leckband of Nome and Gus Simmers of Anchorage Christian.  Arts became a Division II All-America center and Fossman was an all-conference guard.  One of UAA's biggest Class 3A recruits came while Harry Larrabee was the head coach. Kotzebue's Butch Lincoln became the first Alaska Native to earn a full basketball scholarship at UAA and became a fan favorite, and a play-making starting point guard, during his time there from 1992-97.  A pair of Level 10 gymnasts are the first recruits for first-year gymnastics coach Tanya Ho.  Alexandriz Britz of Orting, Washington, and Katelyn Fandrich of Easley, South Carolina, will join the Seawolves next season.  Britz was an all-around qualifier for the 2017 Junior Olympics in her first season at Level 10, which is the sport's highest skill level. At the 2017 Region 2 championships, she placed second on bars, third on vault and fifth in all-around.  Fandrich has competed at Level 10 since 2014.  "Both Kate and Alex are strong Level 10 (gymnasts) who will make an immediate impact for us as freshmen," Ho said in a press release.

 The UAA women's basketball team will bring home a nice souvenir from its first road trip of the season – an undefeated record.  The Seawolves, the nation's fourth-ranked Division II team, overcame a cold-shooting first quarter to bury Cal State Los Angeles 77-50 on Saturday to run their record to 3-0.  Hannah Wandersee, a 6-foot-1 junior center, continued her strong start with 16 points on 8 of 10 shooting. She has scored in double figures in all three victories as well as in last week's exhibition loss to Division I powerhouse Duke, a setback that doesn't count on UAA's record.  Wandersee led a balanced effort that produced rebounds from all 12 players, points from 10, assists from 10 and steals from eight.  "Our defense was responsible for this win today," said UAA head coach Ryan McCarthy, who earned his 150th career coaching victory. "We were OK once we found our rhythm in the second quarter, but we need to get off to a stronger start, especially offensively.  "The bottom line, though, is that we're happy to be unbeaten after three games and looking forward to finally playing in front of our home crowd next week."  After hitting just 5 of 16 shots in the first quarter, UAA connected on 25 of 48 (52.1 percent) the rest of the way.  Down 14-13 after the first 10 minutes of play, the Seawolves grabbed the lead for good midway through the second quarter on a layup by Wandersee.  Rodericka Ware, a senior guard, had a game-high five steals to go along with 14 points, four assists and four rebounds for the Seawolves.  Shelby Cloninger, a senior forward, added 13 points and a game-high seven rebounds and Yazmeen Goo, a sophomore guard, chipped in nine points and a game-high five assists.  The Seawolves make their home debut in the Seawolf Hoops Classic that runs Friday and Saturday at the Alaska Airlines Center. UAA plays Holy Names on Friday and Western State on Saturday. Both games start at 5:15 p.m.

Under Armour, Inc. (UAA) is an interesting player in the Consumer Goods space, with a focus on Textile – Apparel Clothing. The stock has been active on the tape, currently trading at $12.17, down from yesterday’s close by -2.80%. Given the stock’s recent action, it seemed like a good time to take a closer look at the company’s recent data. Fundamental Analysis Does this stock stack up well when compared to its peers in the industry space? Let’s take a look. Under Armour, Inc. (UAA) currently trades with a market capitalization of $4.93 Billion. That value represents a market adjusting for revenues that have been falling by -4.48 % on a quarterly year/year basis as of the company’s last quarterly report. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For UAA, the company currently has $258 Million of cash on the books, which is offset by $297 Million current liabilities. You can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $79.31 Million over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to fall in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $0 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 31.12% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors. Technical Analysis No analysis is ever complete without a thorough survey of a stock’s technical behavior. Looking at the stock’s movement on the chart, Under Armour, Inc. recorded a 52-week high of $33.45. It is now trading 21.28% off that level. The stock is trading $15.82 its 50-day moving average by 3.65%. The stock carved out a 52-week low down at $11.40. In recent action, Under Armour, Inc. (UAA) has made a move of -25.11% over the past month, which has come on weak relative transaction volume. Over the trailing year, the stock is underperforming the S&P 500 by 19.32, and it’s gotten there by action that has been less volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. In terms of the mechanics underlying that movement, traders will want to note that the stock is trading on a float of 14.43% with $369.97 Million sitting short, betting on future declines. That suggests something of the likelihood of a short squeeze in shares of UAA.

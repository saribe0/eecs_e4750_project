Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. WMT may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Wal-Mart is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for WMT in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 98 cents per share for WMT, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 97 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for WMT, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.96% heading into earnings season.Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.

Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) is an interesting player in the Services space, with a focus on Discount, Variety Stores. The stock has been active on the tape, currently trading at $90.99, up from yesterday’s close by 0.08%. Given the stock’s recent action, it seemed like a good time to take a closer look at the company’s recent data. Fundamental Analysis It’s important to get a feel for how any stock is actually valued on the market based on its core numbers. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) currently trades with a market capitalization of $269.95 Billion. That value represents a market adjusting for revenues that have been growing by 2.07 % on a quarterly year/year basis as of the company’s last quarterly report. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For WMT, the company currently has $6.47 Billion of cash on the books, which is offset by $7.17 Billion current liabilities. You can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $17.54 Billion over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to grow in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $0.97 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 32.52% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors. Technical Analysis We’ve taken a serious look at this stock from a fundamental perspective, but the tale of the tape may offer more hints about what lies under the surface. Looking at the stock’s movement on the chart, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. recorded a 52-week high of $91.69. It is now trading 0.7% off that level. The stock is trading $83.71 its 50-day moving average by -7.28%. The stock carved out a 52-week low down at $65.28. In recent action, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) has made a move of +6.12% over the past month, which has come on weak relative transaction volume. Over the trailing year, the stock is underperforming the S&P 500 by 19.32, and it’s gotten there by action that has been less volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. In terms of the mechanics underlying that movement, traders will want to note that the stock is trading on a float of 3.12% with $1.41 Billion sitting short, betting on future declines. That suggests something of the likelihood of a short squeeze in shares of WMT.

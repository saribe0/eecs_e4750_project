Apple just got its first head of diversity and inclusion in May. But already, Denise Young Smith, one of the most powerful and senior black executives in tech, is planning to leave the company at the end of the year, according to TechCrunch. The VP role at Apple will be taken over by Christie Smith, who worked at Deloitte until earlier this year. Smith’s LinkedIn page suggests that she has already taken over the post. Apple was not immediately available for comment when Quartz contacted the company over the report. Last month, Young Smith caused a whirlwind of controversy when she was describing her work, saying that she thought it was possible for a group of white men to represent diversity by having a range of life experiences. Speaking on a panel discussion on fighting racial injustice—moderated by Quartz—at the One Young World Summit in Bogotá, Colombia last month, Young Smith said: “Diversity is the human experience. I get a little bit frustrated when diversity or the term diversity is tagged to the people of color, or the women, or the LGBT.” She went on to say “there can be 12 white, blue-eyed, blonde men in a room and they’re going to be diverse too because they’re going to bring a different life experience and life perspective to the conversation.” The issue, Young Smith explains, “is representation and mix.” Even thought the comments were met with audience applause in Bogotá, less than a week later, Young Smith issued an apology to her colleagues over the comments. “I regret the choice of words I used to make this point,” she wrote in an email obtained by TechCrunch, “I understand why some people took offense. My comments were not representative of how I think about diversity or how Apple sees it.” Young Smith has been at Apple for 20 years, and was most recently the global head of HR. According to TechCrunch, her plans to leave Apple might predate the comments she made in Colombia. Young Smith had begun discussing the next phase of her career with CEO Tim Cook about a year ago, TechCrunch reports citing an unnamed source. The search for a successor had begun a few months ago, they say. Last week, Cornell Tech announced that Young Smith would become the new executive-in-residence from January to work with students to build “an early career-stage awareness of inclusive leadership and diverse talent.”

With the recent  release of the iPhone X, Apple could become the first $1 trillion dollar company in 2018 (if Amazon doesn’t catch up), a GBH Insights analyst said in a note, according to  CNBC. Apple is currently sitting at $868.1 billion, but the number could rise over the next year as the iPhone X pushes consumers to upgrade their iPhones. The Cupertino company’s share prices could rise between $210 and $230 in 2018, the analyst, Daniel Ives, said. AAPL stock as of Thursday afternoon was at  $171.51, up from Wednesday’s $169.08 close. Wall Street analysts have predicted a  super cycle with the release to the 2017 iPhones, and Ives’ prediction is similar. The analyst said there are over 350 million users with iPhones that are at least two years old, and many of those are due for an upgrade. The analyst note said: "It all comes down to the success and elongated demand trajectory of iPhone X over the coming quarters to determine if Apple finally ends up joining the elusive trillion dollar market cap club in 2018, in our opinion. [...] To this point, the first stage of the iPhone X launch is off to a great start in what will be a crucial prove me period for Cook and Apple over the next year." The high price of the iPhone X, which starts at $999, could also play a part. Apple’s average selling price will increase from $643 in fiscal year 2017 to $746 in fiscal year 2018, Ives said. Most people could also go for the 256GB version of the iPhone X, which costs $1,149, according to GBH Insights data. As for the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, which were released in September, Ives said Apple will sell more of those models than during the peak iPhone 6 upgrade cycle. That would put the number of iPhone units for Apple's fiscal year to the end of September 2018 at 258 million, past the record 231 million that was seen in 2015. Apple’s services division, which includes Apple Music and iCloud, could also boost the company. CEO Tim Cook said  during the latest earnings call earlier this month that Apple’s services business is now the size of a Fortune 100 company. The Cupertino giant posted all-time record results for its services business, with paid subscriptions reaching 210 million at end of the September quarter. Apple Music in particular saw a 75 percent year-over-year increase in subscriptions, the company said. Ives predicts the Apple services business will reach $50 billion in revenues for the fiscal year ending September 2020. Apple’s growth in China, which Ives describes as a “renaissance,” could also allow Apple to become a $1 trillion dollar company. The analyst estimates there is an install base of 100 million iPhone users in China, with half of them due for an upgrade in the next 12-18 months. Meanwhile, In the earnings call, Apple said its revenue grew 12 percent from a year ago quarter in China. For now, Apple is predicting a strong holiday season. The company said a few weeks ago it expects the fiscal 2018 first quarter to be its biggest quarter yet. The company has been pushing its latest products to  holiday shoppers on its site, including the iPhone X, iPhone 8, Apple Watch Series 3 and the Apple TV 4K.

Source: Shutterstock Investing guru Warren Buffett has always been cautious about the tech sector. A rapidly changing landscape and fierce competition make it difficult to choose a winner for the long term. However, Buffett has been a bit more open to tech investments over the past few years and a recent regulatory filing showed that the Oracle of Omaha has been buying up shares of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Earlier this week, regulatory filings showed that Buffett increased his holdings of AAPL stock by 3% during the third quarter to a total 134 million shares. His purchase makes him the fifth-largest Apple stock holder. To be sure, data on these purchases is somewhat outdated and it’s never a good idea to blindly follow anyone, even Warren Buffet, I think he is on to something. The AAPL stock price has been on a bit of a roller coaster ride so far this year as worries about iPhone sales weighed on investor confidence in Apple’s future. However, even with the ups and downs, AAPL stock has still increased more than 45% so far this year, that, combined with the tech-maker’s strong financial position, compelling moat and strong brand position, make it a good long-term pick. As AAPL stock has declined 4% over the last five day, we are at a good entry point. Apple’s fourth quarter results beat expectations and gave investors a reason to believe that The Fruit was on its way back to the top. Revenue came in at $52.6 billion, above analysts expectations of $50.7 billion. More importantly, AAPL topped forecasts of 46 million for iPhone unit sales, with the actual figure coming in slightly higher at 46.7 million. Although the iPhone unit sales were only marginally higher than what analysts were expecting, Apple brought in a ton of cash as the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus became the firm’s best-selling products as soon as they were launched. Guidance for the future was equally as impressive with revenue seen rising to somewhere between $84 billion and $87 billion in the first quarter. That will add to Apple’s already strong financial position. The company is sitting on a big pile of cash, which bodes well for investors in several ways.

With this in mind, it’s worth taking a look at the chart to get a sense of where it might be headed in the future. How has the stock performed recently? Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the last month has increased +5.83%. Shares are now up over the past year, outperforming the broad market by -100% and outperformed a peer group of similar companies by 257%. After the latest session, which saw the stock close at a price of $169.08, AAPL sits below its 52-week high. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been trading in a bullish manner, based on the relative positions of the stock’s 20 and 200 day moving averages. Momentum indicators

 Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that AAPL may be headed in the future. Fortunately, there is way to use the speed and magnitude of these price changes to predict future performance, thanks to what are known as momentum indicators. As momentum slows, it might be a sign that a support or resistance level has been reached, and that a trend is about to reverse. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for AAPL is 57.90%, which suggests that the stock is not particularly expensive or cheap, and not predisposed to a reactive price movement based on this measure. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 77.49%, tells a different story, and suggests that AAPL currently trades in overbought territory. What do the trading volumes reveal? Volume patterns can also be useful for predicting future performance. When trading activity is abnormally high, it’s often a sign that the market feels particularly strong in one way or another about the future direction of a stock. Apple Inc. (AAPL) average trading volume of 30,673,455 during the past month is 14.71% above its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been more active than usual in the stock in recent times. What do the analysts think? AAPL is currently undervalued by -9.26% relative to the average 1-year price target of $186.34 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 1.80, which implies that analysts are generally bullish in their outlook for AAPL over the next year. How risky is the stock?  In order to put AAPL’s recent price performance into context, we need to get a sense of how the stock moves in relation to the overall market. Beta, which measures a stock’s price volatility relative to the market, provides the cleanest measure of systematic risk for a stock. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has a beta of 1.21, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are more extreme than the market as a whole. AAPL therefore has a above average level of market risk. During the past couple of weeks, AAPL average daily volatility was 23.39%, which is -4.18 percentage points higher than the average volatility over the past 100 days.

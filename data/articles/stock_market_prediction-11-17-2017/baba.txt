https://simplywall.st/news/2017/11/17/want-to-invest-in-alibaba-group-holding-limited-baba-heres-how-it-performed-lately/

 After reading Alibaba Group Holding Limited’s (NYSE:BABA) most recent earnings announcement (30 September 2017), I found it useful to look back at how the company has performed in the past and compare this against the latest numbers. As a long-term investor I tend to focus on earnings trend, rather than a single number at one point in time. Also, comparing it against an industry benchmark to understand whether it outperformed, or is simply riding an industry wave, is a crucial aspect. Below is a brief commentary on my key takeaways. Check out our latest analysis for Alibaba Group Holding   For the purpose of this commentary, I like to use the ‘latest twelve-month’ data, which annualizes the most recent half-year data, or in some cases, the latest annual report is already the most recent financial year data. This method enables me to examine different companies on a similar basis, using the latest information. For Alibaba Group Holding, the latest earnings is $60,853M, which, in comparison to the prior year’s level, has jumped by an impressive 84.20%. Given that these figures may be fairly nearsighted, I’ve created an annualized five-year value for Alibaba Group Holding’s net income, which stands at $38,275M. This means on average, Alibaba Group Holding has been able to steadily improve its earnings over the past few years as well.   While past data is useful, it doesn’t tell the whole story. Companies that have performed well in the past, such as Alibaba Group Holding gives investors conviction. However, the next step would be to assess whether the future looks as optimistic.

While Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been a great stock in 2017, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NASDAQ:BABA) has been even better. The U.S.-based online retailer is up 50% so far this year, but the Chinese-based Alibaba has doubled. Its market cap is now $464 billion, against Amazon’s $543 billion. Not only that, but Alibaba is a better company than Amazon, in many ways. It routinely brings $1 in every $4 of revenue to the net income line. It is growing much faster, over 60% year-over-year. It is much, much smaller, still bringing in less than $10 billion each quarter (the Chinese Yuan trades at 6.63 to the dollar). Alibaba also has a much larger growth runway, given the size of the Asian market where it makes its home. For these reasons, I expect the market cap of Alibaba to soon surpass that of Amazon and not look back. Amazon relies on physical infrastructure, like warehouses, but Alibaba consists almost entirely of computer infrastructure. It does much more work through alliances than Amazon, which is why its rise has created 10 other billionaires whose combined wealth is greater than founder Jack Ma’s own. Alibaba was founded to help small manufacturers connect to retail and industrial buyers. While it has gone far afield of that, with its own online shopping mall and even investments in physical stores, the stock does not reflect that. Alibaba is primarily a “fintech” company, and the top three leaders in the space, according to KPMG, are affiliates. Thus, very little of the $25 billion in sales contracted for on its “Singles Day” will flow through the main company, as will little of the fulfillment cost. If you want to buy the “Japanese Amazon.com,” you should buy JD.Com Inc(ADR) (NASDAQ:JD), whose business models Amazon’s closely and has had roughly the same size gain this year. BABA has developed its systems, and brand name, against a backdrop of hyper-growth, with literally hundreds of millions of people whose parents were peasants moving into urban skyscrapers. The company also has been quick to move into fast-growing Southeast Asian economies.

Jack Ma led Chinese eCommerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA) has had a mind-boggling single's day sales which seem to justify its price to earnings multiple of 62. BABA stock investors too are a happy lot with the share price doubling in the year. We had rightly hinted in our earlier coverage that Alibaba is all set to have record-breaking single's day sales. However, Alibaba stock has failed to take off since reporting impressive numbers. This brings us to the question, is the upside in Alibaba stock limited from here? Well, if you go by some of the latest industry trends, the strong revenue and earnings growth of the Chinese online retail giant is to continue for some time now, which is likely to drive BABA stock higher.
 In the fiscal 2018 second-quarter earnings release, Alibaba's China retail revenue grew 64% YoY. This forms the bulk of the Chinese behemoth's revenues. Now, if a latest eMarketer report is anything to go by, then Alibaba's core commerce segment could likely continue growing its revenues at high rates in the coming quarters as well. The report suggests that cross-border eCommerce spending in China to top the $100 billion threshold in 2017. The eMarketer estimates state that "Average spend per buyer has increased since eMarketer’s previous forecast due to the growing awareness of overseas brands in China, as well as better logistics and the perception that foreign goods are of better quality." The study also finds the popularity of Alibaba's Tmall Global as one of the factor's driving these pattern. This could be a strong tailwind for the online retail giant.  Further, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analysts' in their recent note to clients commenting about the single's day sales wrote: "there was a 4x multiple of growth in the sale global brands, and strength in cross-border trade as more and more Chinese shoppers use mobile devices." They are of the opinion that this could result in better than expected China retail revenue growth in the December quarter which hints at more upside potential in BABA stock if the momentum is sustained. The eMarketer study further boosts the above stance as the cross-border eCommerce spending tailwind is likely to last longer. Alibaba registered nearly 40% YoY increase in GMV on its single's day but the stock has not moved much following single's day sale. However, this also means one expect another blockbuster earnings release in January. To put things into perspective as seen in the image below, the Chinese company tops Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Thanksgiving and Black Friday sales combined. This is the proportion of difference with which Alibaba is growing its GMV. Amazon's annual Prime Day sale was estimated to have moved $1 billion worth of goods only. Raymond James analysts wrote that BABA stock's underperformance even after strong sales was due to the fact that "market already knows that the Chinese consumer is buying more",  which is also reflected in the 100% rise in the market. However, they reiterated their strong buy rating on Alibaba stock and it is only matter of time Alibaba stock goes past the psychologically important $200 mark.  We did suggest in our recent coverage that Alibaba stock could come under pressure recently due to the technical set up. However, BABA stock technical chart now hints at some positive signals. Alibaba stock has found support at its 50-day simple moving average (SMA). In the last trading session, the share price bounced back from the 50-day SMA which has acted as a strong support level for the majority of 2017. Alibaba share price has only breached the 50-day SMA only once this year, in October. The stock is likely to head higher from here.  To sum up, Alibaba stock continues to be an attractive investing idea for growth investors. Though the BABA stock has doubled for the year, the stock may continue climbing higher. At these levels, Alibaba stock may not appear cheap but given its just trading 28 times the forward earnings, there is potential for plenty of more upside given the impressive revenue and earnings growth coupled with the tailwinds the company is enjoying.

As a long-term investor I tend to focus on earnings trend, rather than a single number at one point in time. Also, comparing it against an industry benchmark to understand whether it outperformed, or is simply riding an industry wave, is a crucial aspect. Below is a brief commentary on my key takeaways. Check out our latest analysis for Alibaba Group Holding   For the purpose of this commentary, I like to use the ‘latest twelve-month’ data, which annualizes the most recent half-year data, or in some cases, the latest annual report is already the most recent financial year data.

For Alibaba Group Holding, the latest earnings is $60,853M, which, in comparison to the prior year’s level, has jumped by an impressive 84.20%. Given that these figures may be fairly nearsighted, I’ve created an annualized five-year value for Alibaba Group Holding’s net income, which stands at $38,275M. This means on average, Alibaba Group Holding has been able to steadily improve its earnings over the past few years as well.   While past data is useful, it doesn’t tell the whole story.

After working in the restaurant industry for years as a manager at various eateries in the area, he felt now was the right time.  “I believe I have enough experience now to run my own," Hamed said.  Akram Hamed, owner of Ali Baba Mediterranean restaurant, poses for a photo on Tuesday, Nov. 14, 2017. (Photo: Staff photo by Ralph Musthaler) The name Ali Baba originates from one of the "Arabian Nights" stories called "Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves." Hamed said the name is popular with Middle Eastern and Mediterranean restaurants. With no restaurant named Ali Baba in Salisbury, Hamed said he knew the name would be a good fit.  More: Ugly Pie opens storefront in downtown Salisbury: 'It’s nice to have a home finally' Hamed and Gad are both originally from Egypt.

Nothing is too spicy or too under-seasoned.  For foodies who are fans of Mediterranean cuisine stemming from a different country, they'll find recognizable dishes at Ali Baba with just a little bit of a twist.  More: Chuar brings authentic Chinese food to Salisbury Gad said her spice shelf is full with spices like cumin, red pepper, black pepper, garlic, turmeric, curry, paprika and nutmeg.      Ali Baba dishes include stuffed grape leaves filled with rice, ground beef, tomatoes and mixed herbs; hummus dip made with ground chickpeas, tahini, garlic, lemon juice and olive oil; and chicken or beef shawarma, which some know as gyro, Hamed said.   The falafel is served with lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, onions, parsley and tahini sauce all bundled up in a wrap.  An exterior view of Ali Baba Mediterranean restaurant on Snow Hill Road on Tuesday, Nov. 14, 2017.  (Photo: Staff photo by Ralph Musthaler) To pair with your food, Ali Baba offers its twist on lemonade made with mint and a few other secret ingredients. The drink comes out in a thick, creamy consistency with a frothy top, garnished with mint leaves. The mint and lemon combination give the drink a balanced taste of sweet and sour.  But, to please all customers, Hamed is also offering American-style dishes. The menu includes wings, pizza, stromboli, burgers, pasta and various subs or wraps.  Hamed said his goal is to please all customers by offering an expansive menu. If one person feels like Mediterranean and another feels like pizza or burgers, both can find what they want to eat at Ali Baba.  “I have both," he said.   More: Downtown Salisbury welcomes skate shop with Skate Park expansion underway Hamed believes Salisbury is ready for more food options of different cultures.   “Before when I came (to Salisbury), it was like not a lot," Hamed said.   Now, Hamed and Gad hope customers become hooked on the dishes. Hamed thinks he can bring a lot of people in to try Mediterranean food since many haven't tried it before and don't know what they're missing. His hopes for the future of Ali Baba includes expansion.    "My goal is every two years (to) open an Ali Baba restaurant," he said.   On Twitter: @The_MegRyan What: Ali Baba Mediterranean & American Grill   Where: 817 Snow Hill Rd.  When: Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., Sunday from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.  Contact: 443-978-7700

Nothing is too spicy or too under-seasoned.  For foodies who are fans of Mediterranean cuisine stemming from a different country, they'll find recognizable dishes at Ali Baba with just a little bit of a twist.  More: Chuar brings authentic Chinese food to Salisbury Gad said her spice shelf is full with spices like cumin, red pepper, black pepper, garlic, turmeric, curry, paprika and nutmeg.      Ali Baba dishes include stuffed grape leaves filled with rice, ground beef, tomatoes and mixed herbs; hummus dip made with ground chickpeas, tahini, garlic, lemon juice and olive oil; and chicken or beef shawarma, which some know as gyro, Hamed said.   The falafel is served with lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, onions, parsley and tahini sauce all bundled up in a wrap.  An exterior view of Ali Baba Mediterranean restaurant on Snow Hill Road on Tuesday, Nov. 14, 2017.  (Photo: Staff photo by Ralph Musthaler) To pair with your food, Ali Baba offers its twist on lemonade made with mint and a few other secret ingredients. The drink comes out in a thick, creamy consistency with a frothy top, garnished with mint leaves. The mint and lemon combination give the drink a balanced taste of sweet and sour.  But, to please all customers, Hamed is also offering American-style dishes. The menu includes wings, pizza, stromboli, burgers, pasta and various subs or wraps.  Hamed said his goal is to please all customers by offering an expansive menu. If one person feels like Mediterranean and another feels like pizza or burgers, both can find what they want to eat at Ali Baba.  “I have both," he said.   More: Downtown Salisbury welcomes skate shop with Skate Park expansion underway Hamed believes Salisbury is ready for more food options of different cultures.   “Before when I came (to Salisbury), it was like not a lot," Hamed said.   Now, Hamed and Gad hope customers become hooked on the dishes. Hamed thinks he can bring a lot of people in to try Mediterranean food since many haven't tried it before and don't know what they're missing. His hopes for the future of Ali Baba includes expansion.    "My goal is every two years (to) open an Ali Baba restaurant," he said.   On Twitter: @The_MegRyan What: Ali Baba Mediterranean & American Grill   Where: 817 Snow Hill Rd.  When: Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., Sunday from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.  Contact: 443-978-7700

309 Park Ave., Worcester • 508-752-8822 • babasushi.com For a long time, Baba was the only restaurant in this area to offer the true panache of a big city restaurant, its modern Asian decor and unassuming sophistication setting it apart from the rest of Worcester’s dining scene. That is, objectively, no longer true. With more options on the horizon for local patrons, including at least one new sushi spot to which this magazine recently awarded four out of five stars, one would suspect the buzz around Baba might finally begin to fade into more of a murmur. On the contrary, the converted residential space at 309 Park Ave. is teeming with customers who are as fresh as its sashimi. A new crop of diners seem to unearth Baba each week. Once referred to by locals as “Boston-caliber,” Baba has effectively set its own superb standards, granting it a unique identity all its own and raising the bar for other Worcester proprietors. The space itself is cramped, if not intimate. Winter coat season just about guarantees you’ll be bumped or jostled on your next visit. Those willing to squeeze past the bar and navigate the dimly-lit dining room will find Baba’s rear annex a bit more spacious. Here, a melodic fountain and a slew of petite bamboo tables offer a welcome view of the sushi chef working diligently at his station.  Service is warm and informative, though spread thin at times. Neither the menu nor the wine list changes with any frequency, ensuring servers can offer guidance and opinions on nearly every dish. On busy evenings, it can take upwards of 30 minutes from the time your chopsticks hit the empty plate until you settle up the bill, though not for lack of urgency on the staff’s part. Visitors will likely spot owner Wilson Wang, who was trained at Oishii in Chestnut Hill, as he breezes back and forth between Baba and his neighboring venture, Chuan Shabu. He also operates the sister Baba Sushi in Sturbridge.  Guests should not limit themselves to sushi, but should opt as well for a few of the starters, including the Baba oyster shooters ($5), each one served with a quail egg yolk that slides past the lips in a briny and tropical flood of the senses. It is wise to request an order of the hamachi kama ($14), a double-baked, tender yellowtail jaw served with teriyaki sauce, but quantities are supremely limited. The staff will suggest the “Tartaki Trio” ($23), referred to on most Japanese menus as tataki or tosa-mi. The seared maguro (bluefin tuna), shiro maguro (escolar) and sake (salmon) are served with distinctive sauces that reveal Wang’s aptitude for identifying a unique balance to reckon with the American palate. Likewise, the edamame ($6) demonstrates a sense of control with its simple and even seasoning. The jalapeno yellowtail ($12) is Baba’s ultimate demonstration of refined restraint in its presentation of a narrow plate of yellowtail sashimi infused with citrus sauce and delicately-topped with jalapeno and caviar. The dish offers a wet, bright heat that is at once jolting and refreshing. Still, a trip to Baba is incomplete without sushi rolls. The cucumber sashimi shiro ($16) is stunning on its best day, but depending on the chef, can at times appear sloppily executed. With proper polish, the maguro, tuna, salmon and Alaskan king crab practically glow within a single, hand-sliced cucumber wrap topped with vibrant mango salsa and severe black caviar. Alternately, fussy eaters will devour the Lion King Maki ($16), an inviting combination of spicy tuna, tempura crunch, Alaskan king crab and eel sauce.  The wine list has remained relatively constant in my memory and the Tohu Sauvignon Blanc ($10) is nothing if not reliable for those who are partial to ripe, tropical fruit. In regards to sake, servers can point guests in the direction of creamy, full-bodied selections to pair with oily fish or something big and funky to compliment Baba’s lighter rolls. And there’s always Sapporo ($8.95), for those who prefer a crisp Japanese lager with their sushi. Baba is a Central Mass institution, a fact only emphasized by the onslaught of new restaurants bringing newcomers to town. Visitors should expect a level of consistency in the quality of Wang’s dishes that can’t be relied upon at younger establishments in the neighborhood. The price tag will reflect this echelon of excellence. On our last visit, dinner for two with one round of drinks rang $109.09, not including the tip.

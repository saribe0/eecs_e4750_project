Latest evolution in the price of Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) stock has been one of the most talked about matter among the interested investors. Analysts often use price and volume data to predict future stock performance. In the case of BAC, the chart has some interesting things to say about where the stock might be headed. How has the stock performed recently? Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) in the last month has increased +1.17%. Shares are now up over the past year, outperforming the broad market by -100% and outperformed a peer group of similar companies by 193%. After the latest session, which saw the stock close at a price of $26.79, BAC sits below its 52-week high. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) has been trading in a bullish manner, based on the relative positions of the stock’s 20 and 200 day moving averages. Momentum indicators

 Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that BAC may be headed in the future. In order to predict this, technical analysts look at momentum indicators, which measure the speed and magnitude of these price movements. The idea is that as momentum slows, it may signal the approach of key support or resistance levels and a reversal of recent trends. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for BAC is 54.23%, which suggests that the stock is not particularly expensive or cheap, and not predisposed to a reactive price movement based on this measure. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 23.03%, tells a different story, and suggests that BAC currently trades in oversold territory. What do the trading volumes reveal? Analysts use volume trends to assess the level of conviction behind a stock’s price changes. When volumes suddenly increase above normal levels, it can be a sign that investors feel very strongly in one way or the other about the future direction of a stock, or may even have access to inside information. Bank of America Corporation (BAC) average trading volume of 65,023,805 during the past month is 16.83% below its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been less active than usual in the stock in recent times. What do the analysts think? BAC is currently undervalued by -4.97% relative to the average 1-year price target of $28.19 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 2.10, which implies that analysts are generally neutral in their outlook for BAC over the next year. How risky is the stock?  When predicting the future performance for a stock, it’s also important to take into account risk. To do this, analysts often use a stock’s beta, which measures the stock’s volatility relative to the overall market. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) has a beta of 1.32, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are more extreme than the market as a whole. BAC therefore has a above average level of market risk. During the past couple of weeks, BAC average daily volatility was 16.17%, which is 2.77 percentage points lower than the average volatility over the past 100 days.

Sector rotation was the name of the game Wednesday. While oil stocks returned to Earth, financials were flying high. Perhaps the biggest bank stock reveling in the gains is Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), which has already climbed 2.20% yesterday. With the BAC stock uptrend now reaffirmed, bull trades are worth a shot. The timing of today’s jump was fortuitous. Recent selling pressures were threatening to reverse BofA’s uptrend. Over the past six trading sessions, BAC shed 5% of value falling all the way to the 50-day moving average. Chart watchers often view a break of this indicator as a negative omen signaling a trend reversal. Remaining above the 50-day keeps a stock in the good graces of bulls everywhere. The high volume accompanying BAC’s decline was also worrisome. Remember, high volume down days suggest distribution or widespread selling by institutions which often weighs on a stock for days to come. If yesterday’s sharp rebound sticks, it will mostly negate the damage dealt by the distribution. If this is the beginning of BofA’s next advance, then there’s no time like the present to deploy bullish trades.   With the return of volatility, the premium in BAC stock options is getting juiced once more. And that’s increasing the appeal of short premium strategies like the naked put. The stock’s cheap price tag ($26) will keep the margin cost for the trade minimal which creates a more attractive return on investment. Sell the Dec $26 put for 43 cents. If the stock remains above $26 for the next month, the put will expire worthless allowing you to pocket the max reward of 43 cents. That may not sound like a lot, but the initial cost of the trade is only $455, so we’re looking at a potential 9.5% return on investment. That’s decent cash flow for one month’s worth of work. As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn’t hold positions in any of the aforementioned securities. Want more education on how to trade? Check out his trading blog, Tales of a Technician.

The FINANCIAL -- Brisbane Airport Corporation’s (BAC) CEO and Managing Director, Julieanne Alroe, will retire from the Corporation at the end of the current financial year, Chairman David Peever announced on November 16. Ms Alroe has led BAC since 2009. “When Julieanne finishes with BAC next year she will leave a company, and an airport, that is all the better for her exceptional leadership,” Mr Peever said. “Julieanne’s stewardship has seen the company recognised as amongst the most successful, engaged and innovative companies in the country, and she has guided the airport to where it is today, recognised globally as the best airport in the Australia/Pacific region. “Brisbane’s new runway, now under construction and the largest aviation project in the country, is a testament to her vision, tenacity and business acumen. Julieanne’s leadership in getting this project ‘off the ground’ ensured Brisbane, Queensland and Australia will reap the benefits of this $1.3 billion private investment for decades to come.” Mr Peever said Ms Alroe’s time at BAC was also marked by a new era of engagement by the company in the broader life of the city and state, according to Brisbane Airport Corporation. “BAC’s partnerships, across the arts, the tourism industry, economic development and infrastructure were driven by Julieanne’s belief that the company had a responsibility to play a larger role outside its boundaries,” he said. “Most importantly of all, BAC has become a better neighbour to the many people who live in the city and its community engagement and philanthropic endeavours set a standard for airports nationwide.” Mr Peever said recruitment was currently underway for a replacement for Ms Alroe.

Source: Shutterstock It’s reasonably safe to say that whatever lingering problems Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) had with the subprime mortgage meltdown from 2008 are not just in the past, they’re well in the past after lingering an unusually long time for this particular bank. Indeed, BofA has moved on to a whole new set of problems that nag owners of BAC stock, like dealing with soured loans to struggling energy companies and a merely so-so investment banking business. Even then though, there’s no denying Bank of America is finally offering the stability and predictability investors have been wanting for a long while now. It’s time to move deeper into the details, pinpointing exactly what’s working and not working for the megabank. And one simple chart can do the deed. Kudos to Bank of America for finally turning the corner 2015 and 2016. Earnings per share of BAC stock took a turn for the better in 2015, and 2016 is when we saw the top line start to edge higher. The progress is still a little uneven, but at least the progress is measurable. The follow-up question any savvy investor should be asking now: What is Bank of America doing well, and what is it doing poorly? It needs to do more of the former, and needs to fix the latter. As they say, read ’em and weep. 
Click to Enlarge For investors not familiar with BofA’s divisional breakdown, its Consumer & Business Banking arm caters to retail consumers, taking deposits, making mortgage loans, and helping customers open checking accounts. That unit is doing fine, revenue-wise and in terms of income. The company’s Global Banking business, which meets the basic banking needs of larger, institutional customers here and abroad (including investment banking services), is doing fine as well. Its Global Markets and Global Wealth and Investment Management divisions, on the other hand, have been persistently lackluster.

Segment is a startup that helps companies collect customer data from a variety of siloed sources and place that data in a single usable record. Today, it announced it has added a new tool to prepare for the EU’s GDPR privacy guidelines, which are coming in May next year. The new tool makes it a simple matter to stop collecting data or completely remove a person’s information from the system in a process known as the “right to be forgotten.” Segment has made a name for itself by providing a set of APIs that enable it to gather data about a customer from a variety of sources like your CRM tool, customer service application and website and pull that all together into a single view of the customer, something that is the goal of every company in the customer information business. Before you get creeped out by the data collection angle, realize that this company isn’t gathering this data to sell it, it’s gathering it so that the company you do business with has a clearer understanding of your interactions with them across the company. That means if you ordered something online, then went into the store, the clerk can look up your customer record and see all of your interactions, something that just isn’t that easy to do at this point for most companies. “Our perspective around customer data, is that consumers want a personalized experience, so companies need to understand their customers,” Peter Reinhardt, Segment co-founder and CEO told TechCrunch. But he understands that customers don’t want their interactions sold to a third party, which he likens to the grocer gossiping with the banker about what you bought. In reality, it’s painfully difficult to move this data where it’s needed. “Being a customer-centric business these days, especially in digital channels is effectively a problem of data infrastructure and Segment helps companies [solve] that,” Reinhardt explained. The flip side of that is that it can now help you stop gathering information too. It has added a new API, that lets you stop collecting data on an individual, who requests that. Under GDPR rules, a company is duty bound to comply with that request. What’s more, if the individual wants you to strike all of their customer data from your records, you can do that too. If you think about what Segment does, gather all the data about a customer in one place, it greatly simplifies the ability to act on a removal request because instead of having to look across multiple systems for the customer information and check each one, Segment is doing all of that work for you in an automated fashion. Segment was founded in 2011 and released its first product in 2012. It has raised over $108M including a $64 M Series C round in July led by Y Combinator. It currently has 180 employees to go along with 15,000 customers including Hotel Tonight, Atlassian, Crate & Barrel, Draft Kings and New Relic.

Security Amazon: We're fixing flaw that leaves Key security camera open to Wi-Fi jamming

 A Ukrainian cybersecurity firm has discovered an unsecured cache of ABC Commercial files, which it says includes two years of database backups, email addresses and hashed passwords. The files were found by cybersecurity firm Kromtech on an incorrectly configured internet service. The company initially attempted to alert the ABC of the data breach on Wednesday. Kromtech head of communications Bob Diachenko said the firm found the publicly accessible data by accident using a simple search tool. "We used a public search engine, and this tool allows you to search for any open databases connected to the internet," Mr Diachenko said. "So we ran the search … and one of the links that we saw was a link to the commercial department of the ABC." Kromtech said the exposed data included 1,800 daily backups of an ABC Commercial database, as well as requests sent by overseas TV producers to the ABC to license its content. The data was stored on a widely-used commercial cloud service run by internet giant Amazon, called Amazon S3. An ABC spokesperson said the corporation was notified of "a data exposure" on November 16 and technology teams "moved to solve this issue as soon as they became aware". The data is no longer publicly accessible. The ABC's spokesman was asked how long the files were available and unsecured, but no answer was provided.   Mr Diachenko said anyone could have potential access to the data if they knew — or could guess — the name of the folder in which it was stored. "It was open to the public, and what is more alarming is that not only public data was there, but also private data, which is not supposed to be under such a configuration," he said. "It doesn't require any password. You just put the link into your browser and you receive access. "If you're a malicious person and targeting for example the ABC or any other company, you can simply try to get the most popular extensions used by administrators to … gain access." Breaches of personal data held by corporations or government are increasingly common, and recent laws introduced in Australia compel certain organisations to report them. According to a 2017 Australian Cyber Security Centre threat report, criminals can use personally identifiable information to "facilitate financial crimes and identity theft". "Basic information, such as name, birth date and address, is often enough for criminals to impersonate victims," the report reads. The report also warns of inadvertent data exposure via Amazon S3, which is what happened to ABC Commercial. "Data exposed has included customer names, credentials for internal systems, and network diagrams," a case study reports.   Troy Hunt, a security researcher who tracks online data breaches, said he was not surprised by news of the ABC breach. "A lot of the value proposition of the cloud, a lot of the attraction is that it is very cost-effective, it is very easy to access and stand up services," Mr Hunt said. "That makes it fantastic for doing good things with, but all of those attributes also make it extremely easy to make one little mistake. "[This kind of data breach] is not unusual, and the reality of it is the ABC just joins a great big long list of organisations that have done precisely the same thing." A spokesperson for the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner said the agency is not investigating the incident. "This incident is a reminder of how important it is for organisations who use web services like Amazon S3 to check that their security settings are properly configured," the spokesperson said.

Security Amazon: We're fixing flaw that leaves Key security camera open to Wi-Fi jamming 

https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/16/venzee-middleware-tool-could-help-bring-clean-data-to-your-blockchain-project/

If the blockchain is going to be an immutable record, you need to start with clean data. The question is, how do you get clean data into a blockchain database to begin with. It’s kind of a quandary for use cases not starting with a green field, but Venzee, a startup that has been helping customers clean up their retail supply chain data to share with large vendors, thinks it has an answer. Venzee CEO Kate Hiscox sees this as a data transformation problem, something her company has been working to solve for the past three years in the retail space. That sector is awash in spreadsheets that have to be manually prepared to share with big retailers and their database requirements, she says. Venzee acts as a data transformation layer, taking your spreadsheet information in its current form and helping to convert that data into a format that the big retailers like Amazon and Walmart can use. It’s bringing a level of automation, she says has been missing from this industry, one she has worked in for 18 years. If you think about the blockchain, it’s really just a fancy new database, one where you have to ensure that the data going in is correct or you face having bad data in a system that is supposedly immutable and irrefutable. That would be a real problem. Hiscox’s company has created a product called Mesh to deal with this. It’s essentially a data transformation tool for the blockchain that can work for a retail supply chain kind of scenario or other blockchain data transformation requirement and prepare the data to be moved in the appropriate format while providing a data review phase to ensure that it’s accurate, she says. This involves a three-phase process. In the first, the data is validated, and this is a key phase for blockchain data. In the second it’s transformed to work in the new format and finally it’s transferred. Say for example, you were moving data from a land registry to the blockchain. It would require moving the data from its current format, then validating the ownership records before putting it on the blockchain. This tool offers a path to doing that, but it also raises questions about the validation process. If the blockchain is supposed to a trust-based system, how do you ensure that you aren’t creating a means to alter data instead of validating it? These are questions that need to be answered, but this tool is about getting the data ready and moving it. The system will require checks and balances beyond that. This tool is currently available in private Beta and will be released in the first half of 2018.

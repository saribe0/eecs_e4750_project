The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) trade is getting exciting but lets take a deeper look whether it is as good a moment. Now trading with a market value of 195.75B, the company has a mix of catalysts and obstacles that spring from the nature of its operations. In light of the many issues surrounding this company, we thought it was a good time to take a close look at the numbers in order to form a realistic perspective on the fundamental picture for this stock. The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) Fundamentals That Matter It’s generally a good idea to start with the most fundamental piece of the picture: the balance sheet. The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For HD, the company currently has 4.83 billion of cash on the books, which is offset by 545 million in current liabilities. The trend over time is important to note. In this case, the company’s debt has been growing. The company also has 45.96 billion in total assets, balanced by 42.41 billion in total liabilities, which should give you a sense of the viability of the company under any number of imagined business contexts. The Home Depot, Inc. (HD) saw 2.91 billion in free cash flow last quarter, representing a quarterly net change in cash of 925 million. Perhaps most importantly where cash movements are concerned, the company saw about 3.3 billion in net operating cash flow.

 The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) Revenue Growth Potential As far as key trends that demonstrate something of the future investment potential of this stock, we need to take a closer look at the top line, first and foremost. Last quarter, the company saw 28.11 billion in total revenues. That represents a quarterly year/year change in revenues of 0.06 in sequential terms, the HD saw sales decline by 0.18. But what about the bottom line? After all, that’s what really matters in the end. The Home Depot, Inc. (HD) is intriguing when broken down to its core data. The cost of selling goods last quarter was 19.1 billion, yielding a gross basic income of 9.01 billion. For shareholders, given the total diluted outstanding shares of 1.19 billion, this means overall earnings per share of 2.25. Note, this compares with a consensus analyst forecast of 1.59 in earnings per share for its next fiscal quarterly report.

This continues to be an interesting story, and we look forward to updating it again soon on The Home Depot, Inc..

Consumer Reports said a solution may be a digital TV antenna and a one-time cost of $10 to $80.
                     
"Once you buy the antenna, the programming you get is free,” Jim Wilcox, Consumer Reports electronics editor, said. “So, you get all your basic local channels and you don’t have to pay anything. That's really appealing to people who are spending more than $100 a month to get a pay TV package."
                     
There are other benefits to an HD antenna.
                     
"Sometimes, cable channels are compressed and you may find that the pictures that you're getting on your TV using an over-the-air antenna are better than what you were getting with cable," Wilcox said.
                     
But the number of channels someone pick up and the reception quality with an HD TV antenna depends on a few factors.
                     
"To be able to get decent reception, you have to consider how far you are from the broadcast tower and also the geography of where you live, whether there are obstructions like mountains, hills, tress and those kinds of things that could interfere with your signal," Wilcox said.
                     
Both Antennaweb and TV Fool can help give people a clearer picture of what kind of reception they can expect. People can also try their HD TV antenna in different locations around the house. They may see a better picture or more channels near a window or higher on a wall.
                     
Consumer Reports also recommends a rescan now and then –- a new station or two might show up.

Consumer Reports said a solution may be a digital TV antenna and a one-time cost of $10 to $80.
                     
"Once you buy the antenna, the programming you get is free,” Jim Wilcox, Consumer Reports electronics editor, said. “So, you get all your basic local channels and you don’t have to pay anything. That's really appealing to people who are spending more than $100 a month to get a pay TV package."
                     
There are other benefits to an HD antenna.
                     
"Sometimes, cable channels are compressed and you may find that the pictures that you're getting on your TV using an over-the-air antenna are better than what you were getting with cable," Wilcox said.
                     
But the number of channels someone pick up and the reception quality with an HD TV antenna depends on a few factors.
                     
"To be able to get decent reception, you have to consider how far you are from the broadcast tower and also the geography of where you live, whether there are obstructions like mountains, hills, tress and those kinds of things that could interfere with your signal," Wilcox said.
                     
Both Antennaweb and TV Fool can help give people a clearer picture of what kind of reception they can expect. People can also try their HD TV antenna in different locations around the house. They may see a better picture or more channels near a window or higher on a wall.
                     
Consumer Reports also recommends a rescan now and then –- a new station or two might show up.

There are other benefits to an HD antenna.
                     
"Sometimes, cable channels are compressed and you may find that the pictures that you're getting on your TV using an over-the-air antenna are better than what you were getting with cable," Wilcox said.
                     
But the number of channels someone pick up and the reception quality with an HD TV antenna depends on a few factors.
                     
"To be able to get decent reception, you have to consider how far you are from the broadcast tower and also the geography of where you live, whether there are obstructions like mountains, hills, tress and those kinds of things that could interfere with your signal," Wilcox said.
                     
Both Antennaweb and TV Fool can help give people a clearer picture of what kind of reception they can expect. People can also try their HD TV antenna in different locations around the house. They may see a better picture or more channels near a window or higher on a wall.
                     
Consumer Reports also recommends a rescan now and then –- a new station or two might show up.

http://kdvr.com/2017/11/16/tech-review-wyze-20-hd-home-security-camera-wyzecam-review/

Every once a while a new gadget comes along that makes me say, “No way, that’s sounds too good to be true.”  The Wyze HD home security camera is one of those products!  In a world where HD home security cameras cost $100 or more and require monthly subscription fees to save clips to the cloud, a $20 camera with no fees seems impossible.  I put the Wyze to the test. Hardware The WyzeCam looks like a cube!  The grey part on the bottom is the foot and the camera can extend out from the bottom.  It has a magnet built into the base so it attach to metal objects easily.  There's also a metal ring in the box that you can stick to any wall for easy installation of the Wyze. On the underside of the camera is a microSD slot and a setup button.  On the front is the 1080p camera, a microphone, IR lights and other sensors.  That's about it.  The WyzeCam is pretty simple... as it should be. Setup Setting the camera up takes just a few minutes.  Once you press the setup button the camera it will actually speak instructions out loud.  The Android or iPhone app will walk you through the process of connecting the camera to your home Wi-Fi.  I had 2 cameras connected and working within about 5 minutes. Using the cam From there, the app is pretty self explanatory.  You can view the camera live, setup motion notifications and use the 2-way feature to talk via the camera's speaker to the people in your home.  It works just as most of the other cameras out there work.  In fact, I was impressed with out easy the setup was and how easy the app was. Features, features and more features The cool thing is that the Wyze has some pretty unique features that you won't find on other cameras.  It can detect the sound of a smoke alarm or carbon monoxide detector going off and send you an alert on your smartphone!  I also really like that it has a memory card slot so you can store videos and pictures to local storage.  You can even use that memory card to record time lapse videos!  How cool is that? Head in the clouds? Cloud storage is an important part of any home security camera.  It takes those motion detection clips and saves them to a server on the internet.  This allows you to quickly view any motion and save those clips.  Problem is, most companies charge you a fee for cloud storage.  It's often $5/month or more.  The Wyze has 2 weeks of storage included!  This is a rolling 2 weeks so any clip will be automatically deleted from the cloud if you don't save it within 2 weeks.  Perfect!  If you want storage longer than 2 weeks, you can just buy a memory card.  Bottom line, I hate paying big money for a gadget and then having to pay a monthly fee to use it properly!  I love that the Wyze removed that pain point. Things I'd change or fix Some of the videos I recorded had the audio out of sync with the video.  I'm hopeful this will be fixed with a firmware upgrade.  I'd also LOVE if they made an outdoor version of the WyzeCam.  This one is only rated for indoor use. Overall, worth it? Here's the deal... is it the highest quality home security camera?  No!  Is the slickest looking camera?  No!  Is the app the most stable app out there? No!  But it's all pretty good.  Impressively good in my opinion.  This camera feels and works as well as many higher priced models.  It's $20!  You could by 5 of these things for you home for $100.  Frankly, I'm blown away and what you get for $20.  It's a great gift option for someone else or for yourself and is a great affordable way to add home security cameras to your home without breaking the bank. You can buy WyzeCam directly from Wyze on their website.  HEADS UP - Ordering through Amazon will cost you an extra $10 per camera.   Filed in: Good Day Colorado, Technology  Topics: Links Mentioned On TV  Do you have a story you want FOX31 Denver or Channel 2 to check out?

Things I'd change or fix Some of the videos I recorded had the audio out of sync with the video.  I'm hopeful this will be fixed with a firmware upgrade.  I'd also LOVE if they made an outdoor version of the WyzeCam.  This one is only rated for indoor use. Overall, worth it? Here's the deal... is it the highest quality home security camera?  No!  Is the slickest looking camera?  No!  Is the app the most stable app out there? No!  But it's all pretty good.  Impressively good in my opinion.  This camera feels and works as well as many higher priced models.  It's $20!  You could by 5 of these things for you home for $100.  Frankly, I'm blown away and what you get for $20.  It's a great gift option for someone else or for yourself and is a great affordable way to add home security cameras to your home without breaking the bank. You can buy WyzeCam directly from Wyze on their website.  HEADS UP - Ordering through Amazon will cost you an extra $10 per camera.   Filed in: Good Day Colorado, Technology  Topics: Links Mentioned On TV  Do you have a story you want FOX31 Denver or Channel 2 to check out?

November 16, 2017 Audrey Luna, who sings a high A in "The Exterminating Angel," a note so high it that has never been sung before in Met history. The Metropolitan Opera HD broadcast on Saturday at 11 a.m., at Colorado Mountain College, Breckenridge, will be the American premiere of contemporary British composer Thomas Adès's "The Exterminating Angel" based on the 1962 film by Luis Buñuel. This production will be sung in English. The film and opera story depict a group of bourgeois friends being trapped in the dining room of a mansion during a dinner party. Some mysterious force detains those assembled from leaving the room. This self-imposed confinement lasts through three nights and four days, when the dinner guests, initially engaged in conversations and seen sitting in chairs and scattered seats, spend the night sleeping on couches, and under scattered blankets on the floor.  In time their social behavior masks fall down when everyone becomes increasingly irrational in hostile and selfish dialogues, in pairs and in small groups. The guests begin to panic as one of them dies during the night, despite treatment provided by one of the members, a practicing physician. By the third day, as people become more irrational, two more take their own lives. Some of the guests believe that their sacrifice was needed to secure their liberation.  In the third act into the last day, the hostess, Leticia, somehow brings order back to those assembled, again achieving the harmony experienced during the opening act. This realization is captured in a closing aria by Leticia (sung by coloratura soprano Audrey Luna). Now liberated, the guests cross the threshold and are finally able to meet with the crowd outside.  The music has been described by New York Times reviewer Anthony Tommasini as "pulsing with searing power, frenetic breathlessness and an astringent harmonic language spiked with thick, piercing chords, though pensive, dreamy episodes provide welcome relief."   In further reviews, various musical aspects are described. During the guests' captivity, when their inability to leave the room seems more absurd than abject, waltz rhythms proliferate, variously in recall of classic Johann Strauss. In the heaviest, most doom-laden passages, the harmony gravitates toward Wagner. The young lovers, who commit suicide rather than stay at the party for eternity — are given courtly, limpid music of quasi-Baroque character. Adès' thorny, modernist music, played with crackling precision and color by the orchestra, bristles with manic, almost madcap, energy. Of interest, for one short orchestral interlude, composer Adès has eight of the orchestra's violinists trade in their regular instruments for miniature 1/32-size violins. An unusually large battery of percussion instruments lines the Met's pit. Also included is music from a keyboard organ-like instrument, the "ondes Martenot," an instrument that includes a small drawer of controls on the left side of the keyboard by which musical dynamics, from silence to fortissimo, can be produced, including the introduction of woodwind sounds. One reviewer wrote, "If you only will experience only one opera this year, attend 'The Exterminating Angel.'" And in the Huffington Post: "A major cultural event — a spectacular American premier of one of the most anticipated openings of a new opera in years."

Eighteen players from the Turkey Bowl-bound H.D. Woodson football team and seven players from Eastern were suspended for one game after an on-field brawl in their Nov. 11 game, D.C. Schools Chancellor Antwan Wilson announced Wednesday. Eastern’s season is over as the Ramblers did not qualify for postseason play. Woodson, however, is set to play Ballou in the Turkey Bowl, the D.C. Interscholastic Athletic Association title game, on Thanksgiving Day. The suspended players will not be eligible for that game against Ballou, Wilson said. Eastern’s suspended players will sit out the first game of the 2018 season. “I think emotions got carried away and students did some things they’d like to take back,” Wilson said at a Thursday news conference. “Football is a contact sport, but we can’t have fighting.” Woodson senior running back Mychale Salahuddin, who verbally committed to play college football at Southern California, was tackled well out of bounds after a carry in the first half. He shoved the Eastern defender after the play, and another pushed back. Players from the Woodson sideline converged on the group around the five yard-line.  After reviewing film of the altercation, DCPS athletic department personnel identified the players involved. Several other Woodson players who left the Warriors’ bench area but did not participate in the scrum will not face discipline, Wilson said. He declined to name the suspended student-athletes, citing their right to appeal the school system’s ruling.  “This decision is the unfortunate result of unsportsmanlike conduct,” Diana Parente, DCIAA’s executive director, wrote in a letter to Woodson students and parents. “The DCIAA staff, the H.D. Woodson High School football coaches, and DCPS officials are committed to working with the players involved to help prevent incidents like this in the future. The safety of our student athletes is paramount at all times.” The Turkey Bowl will be played at Eastern at 11 a.m. on Nov. 23.

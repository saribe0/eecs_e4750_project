 An effort to persuade the University of Missouri to stop using live pigs to train emergency room doctors has failed.On Thursday, the Washington, D.C.,-based Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine brought national advocates and local activists together outside University Hospital to bring public pressure to bear to end the use of swine in physician training. The demonstration was organized after MU declined to agree to the group's call to abandon the use of pigs.The university’s Animal Care and Use Committee, in a vote earlier this month, approved continuing the protocol governing their use through November 2020.MU is the only one of five emergency residency programs in the state that still uses pigs, said Kerry Foley, a retired emergency physician who worked for Georgetown University and other hospitals for 26 years. Only 16 of 211 emergency residency programs in the U.S. and Canada use pigs to train doctors, according to a survey conducted by the organization.“They were used originally because the technology wasn’t available and now the technology is available,” Foley said as she picketed the hospital with about a dozen others. “You can now obtain things called perfused cadavers, which are very lifelike and true to the experience of working on real patients.” In a statement to the Tribune, MU defended the use of live pigs as an important supplement to training done in simulation labs.“Our goal at the University of Missouri is to provide our emergency medicine resident physicians the skills and procedural knowledge necessary to save the lives of our patients,” spokeswoman Jennifer Coffman wrote.It is not possible to do complete training through simulations, she wrote.“In the extremely rare instances (approximately six animals per year) when we need to train emergency medicine resident physicians on life-saving measures that are not adequately replicated through simulation, we use humane and strict protocols that are reviewed by the university’s Animal Care and Use Committee.”According to the protocol, pigs provide training a simulated patient cannot to practice life-saving techniques.“These procedures when required on humans need to be performed rapidly and accurately,” the protocol approved in 2015 states. “Allowing physicians to train on pig models allows this to happen.”According to the protocol, the eight residents accepted each year for the three-year program need six pigs for every six month session to complete the training. Each pig is anesthetized before training begins and then subjected to eight procedures. The first is to cut through the skin to a vein for access, followed by inserting a deep line to administer fluids, opening the abdomen to determine if fluid is accumulating and inserting an electrode through a vein to reach the heart.The next steps are inserting a chest tube to remove fluid, opening the chest to reach the heart and cutting an airway into the throat. After the pig is dead, the residents learn a technique to drain fluid from the sac around the heart.“Procedures will be performed multiple times by multiple residents on the same animal,” the 2015 protocol states.None of that training requires a pig, Foley said.“We would put forward that the use of baby pigs to teach surgical airway techniques to these residents or chest tube insertions to these residents, it is not true to human anatomy,” she said. “It is much more germane for the students to be learning on actual clinical anatomy models.”Columbia registered nurse Nestor MacKno took part in the demonstration. He said he has been a nurse for 30 years and opposes all research using animals. He said he eats meat but won’t purchase any product that has been raised in a manner he considers inhumane.“I think they need to modernize medical training to bring it in line with the rest of the country,” McKno said. “I have been involved in this for a long time. We organized in 1989 to stop the killing of dogs in the physiology labs.”Social worker Lisa VanHoose, who said she is a vegetarian, said she has had a pig as a pet and would feel hypocritical if she didn’t participate in the demonstration.“I am just a big animal lover and I think the university likes to be on the cutting edge and I don’t understand why they are behind on this issue,” she said.In the statement, Coffman wrote that the university has a strong commitment to human and animal health and that it has worked to expand the adoption of research animals after they are used in experimentation.rkeller@columbiatribune.com573-815-1709  An effort to persuade the University of Missouri to stop using live pigs to train emergency room doctors has failed.

Source: Shutterstock The good times just keep rolling for chip-maker Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU). MU stock has now climbed from $10 in early 2016 to $45 today. The big run has been fueled by a favorable limited supply, big demand dynamic in the DRAM market, which has led to a surge in revenues and profits. When I say surge, I mean surge. Revenues went from $12.4 billion in fiscal 2016 to $20.3 billion in fiscal 2017. More impressively, MU turned a $276 million net loss in 2016 into a $5.1 billion net profit in 2017. But this is a cyclical industry. When the times are good (like they are today), one of the major suppliers boosts capacity to either maintain or grow market share. That brings product prices down, eats away at margins, and just like that, MU’s $5.1 billion in profits are gone. Are we at the top of the cycle? Close, but not there yet. Consequently, MU stock should keep grinding higher. I think $50 is a good level to watch for this name. Here’s how I get there. Things are on fire right now in the DRAM market. The supply-demand dynamics in the global DRAM market remained favorable in the third quarter of 2017. Revenue was up 16% sequentially and hit a record high. Contract prices rose 5% due to booming demand on top of limited supply. That is key, because it implies higher profit margins for MU. Those favorable supply-demand dynamics will actually grow more favorable in the fourth quarter, thanks to booming mobile demand. Going into the fourth quarter, the DRAM market is one of limited supply amid some headline smartphone launches. That gives suppliers big pricing power. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd is already raising the quotes of its mobile DRAM products. Because of this, mobile DRAM prices could rise between 10% and 20% in the fourth quarter. That robust growth will lead to overall DRAM price growth of around 10%, estimates DRAMeXchange. Because of this exceptionally favorable supply-dynamic heading into the fourth quarter of calendar 2017, now seems like a good time to own MU stock. This might be one of the best quarters for MU in company history. But that record quarter won’t be the new normal. It certainly appears as though we are nearing peak cycle in the DRAM market. Samsung is reportedly shifting from a technology migration focus in 2017 to a capacity expansion focus in 2018 in order to preserve its dominant market share. New product will flood into the market, causing the current limited supply situation to be less favorable into the foreseeable future.

http://www.lakenewsonline.com/news/20171116/mu-leaders-announce-rotc-scholarships

Beginning in Fall 2018, the scholarship will cover room and board costs for the freshman year for incoming ROTC students who are national scholarship winners from the Army, Marines Corps, Navy or Air Force. University of Missouri Chancellor Alexander Cartwright and Lt. Col. Gary Kerr, professor of military science and leadership and department head for the University Army ROTC, recently announced a new Mizzou ROTC Scholarship that will expand higher education access and affordability at MU.
Beginning in Fall 2018, the scholarship will cover room and board costs for the freshman year for incoming ROTC students who are national scholarship winners from the Army, Marines Corps, Navy or Air Force.
ROTC scholarships will mean that Mizzou Army and Navy ROTC students who are interested in serving as commissioned officers in the U.S. military will be able to attend the university at a substantially reduced cost. Based on current enrollment, it is expected that more than 45 MU students from Missouri will qualify for the grants annually.
“The University of Missouri has a long-standing commitment to training and educating America’s future leaders; today, we are reaffirming our commitment to providing access to stellar military education to the citizens of Missouri, our nation and the world,” Cartwright said. “It is a tremendous honor to invest in the state’s best and brightest military scholars and we thank them for their current and future service.”
The mission of the ROTC program at Mizzou is to commission the future officer leadership of the U.S. military forces. ROTC is centered on leadership development in both the classroom and field environment and those cadets and midshipmen wishing to continue are commissioned as officers in their respective military branches.
“Cadets interested in serving their country as officers are well-prepared to do so,” said Kerr. “ROTC is a demanding program that attracts the state’s most dedicated students. Students who are eligible for the new scholarships often are involved in leadership roles in student, service and athletic organizations. Most are national honor society members, and many are Eagle Scouts. These awards will build upon the excellence that these students already represent, while keeping college education affordable.”
Mizzou invests about $12 million per year on need-based financial aid to promote access and affordability in higher education. MU students graduate, on average, with $8,000 less in student debt than the national average.
“Keeping higher education affordable while developing our students into future military leaders has always been a priority at Mizzou,” said James Musgraves, commander and executive officer of the University of Missouri Naval ROTC program. “Ensuring that these potential leaders leave us with as little debt as possible will put them on a greater path of success in their military careers.” University of Missouri Chancellor Alexander Cartwright and Lt.

Overkamp SEWARD — Concordia backed up its national ranking on Wednesday night in a Great Plains Athletic Conference game against Midland University. The Bulldogs, ranked third in the nation, downed the Lady Warriors 85-63 behind Brenleigh Daum’s 17 points. The loss drops MU to 3-3 on the season and 0-1 in the GPAC. The Bulldogs, who had five players score in double figures, improve to 5-0 overall and 1-0 in the league. West Point native Amanda Hansen’s field goal put MU up 9-7 with 5:02 left in the opening period, but the Bulldogs closed the quarter on a 12-0 run that was capped by Dani Hoppes’ 3-point shot. MU fought back to close to 23-17 on a Madison Severson 3 with 7:50 left in the half. The Bulldogs, though, used another Hoppes 3 to close the second quarter on a 24-12 run to lead 47-29 at the break. Concordia forced 11 MU turnovers in the first half. The Lady Warriors shot just 33 percent from the field. Quinn Wragge had 15 points for the Bulldogs while Hoppes added 13. MacKenzie Helman finished with 11 and Sydney Feller added 10. “We’ve got to keep getting better every game,” Concordia coach Drew Olson said. “We still have stuff to build on and hopefully this is a good learning lesson for us. Our focus and our energy level just wasn’t where it needs to be.” Concordia only outrebounded MU 45-44, but the Lady Warriors committed 23 turnovers compared to 16 for the Bulldogs. Concordia also hit 13 3-point shots compared to just four for MU. Senior Joelle Overkamp led Midland with 17 points and four steals. Yutan native Maddie Egr had 10 points and five rebounds. Hansen had seven points, six rebounds and three assists. The Lady Warriors will look to get back in the win column on Saturday. They will host Dakota State in a non-conference game at 4 p.m. at the Wikert Event Center. Box Score Midland — Maddie Egr 10, Megan Kucks 5, Amanda Hansen 7, Madison Severson 5, Joelle Overkamp 17, Makenna Sullivan 6, Maddie Meadows 3, Hiliary Huss 4, Christine Felty 2, Sam Ashida 2, Laura Speer 2.

Previously ridiculed, the vast technology sector is currently enjoying a renaissance. Over the last two years, companies like Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) have emerged as market favorites. Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) in particular benefited strongly from the shift in sentiment. After a disastrous 2015, MU stock has a great chance of securing triple-digit returns in 2017. At the same time, investors undoubtedly have concerns about moving too far for too long. Last year, the MU stock price gained 53%. Not only are shares on pace to double that return, since the second half of this year, MU gained 52%. Arguably, in the absence of truly remarkable Micron Technology news, the current rally may seem suspect to some. Moreover, the tech sector overall is overheated. The benchmark exchange-traded fund Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLK) is well into overbought territory, which could spark individual corrections. A prime example is AMD, which started the year strongly but is currently down 2%. From a trading standpoint, anything is possible. However, the primary difference between MU stock and lesser names is that Micron is a classic case of a good company falling into rough circumstances. Across the board, its financials are rock solid. However, in certain critical metrics, such as profitability margins, MU is among the leaders in the global semiconductor industry. These aren’t just fluff numbers, as InvestorPlace writer Tom Taulli asserts. He writes: “Even with the run-up in MU stock, the valuation remains fairly cheap. Consider that the forward price-to-earnings ratio is only about 6.6X.  Perhaps this is why notable value investors have been buying up shares in MU stock, such as Greenlight Capital’s David Einhorn.” I’m not the biggest fan of the P/E ratio, due to it being misunderstood. Still, the entire context makes Micron believable. Of course, without a substantive catalyst for future growth, investors risk holding a worthless bag. In addition, InvestorPlace writer James Brumley notes that the memory card sector has endured multiple boom-bust cycles. Obviously, it’s critical for new buyers that for where the MU stock price is now, the industry doesn’t face another one of these cycles. But catching up on the latest Micron Technology news, the growth argument is very much real. In the second quarter of this year, the company hauled in $925 million from its mobile DRAM business. This represented a significant leap over its Q2 2016 total, which registered $449 million. In fact, going back to at least Q1 2012, this is an all-time record for MU. More significantly, the mobile DRAM sales as a whole more than tripled over the past five years. In other words, the MU stock price is benefitting from a rising tide lifting all boats.

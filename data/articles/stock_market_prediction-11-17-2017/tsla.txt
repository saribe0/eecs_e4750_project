Matt DeBord/Business Insider  Tesla is getting into the trucking business. On Thursday, CEO Elon Musk took the wraps off the company's first electric big rig, a semi the company claims is safer and more efficient than any diesel-powered heavy duty truck on the market. (Tesla also unveiled a working prototype of its new Roadster. You can read more about that here.) Here's a basic breakdown of some its key features:  "Overall, the Semi is more responsive, covers more miles than a diesel truck in the same amount of time, and more safely integrates with passenger car traffic," the company said in a statement. Tesla Tesla is so confident in its truck it is guaranteeing that the truck will not break down for one million miles. Musk said production will begin in 2019 and reservations can be made for $5,000.  The truck is safer than other semis because it was designed with a reinforced battery that helps prevent damage upon impact and also gives the truck a very low center of gravity, the company said.  "Its windshield is made of impact resistant glass. Jackknifing is prevented due to the Semi's onboard sensors that detect instability and react with positive or negative torque to each wheel while independently actuating all brakes," Tesla said in the statement.  Tesla But one of the truck's most striking features is the interior of the vehicle, which is designed specifically for the driver.  For starters, there's enough room in the cabin for the driver to stand. And instead of the driver position being on the left, Tesla has centered it so that the driver has better visibility all around the vehicle.  Two touchscreen displays, one on each side of the driver seat, provide access to things like navigation and blind spot monitoring.  Tesla Tesla's big rig also comes with built-in connectivity, which allows the truck to seamlessly integrate with the fleet's management system to help with routing and scheduling.  Among its other high-tech features, the truck has Enhanced Autopilot which enables automatic braking, lane keeping, and lane departure warning. Cameras on the outside of the vehicle also help detect blind spots and alert the driver when there is a dangerous situation.  Tesla Tesla, though, isn't the only automaker making a push into electric trucks. Earlier this year, Daimler also showed off an electric heavy duty truck concept that has a range of 220 miles per charge. However, the company has not said when the truck would hit the market.  NOW WATCH: Watch Tesla unveil a brand new Roadster, which Musk says will be the fastest production car ever made See Also: SEE ALSO: Everything Tesla wants to accomplish by 2020 FOLLOW US: on Facebook for more car and transportation content!

Image courtesy of Tesla Wall Street analysts have often compared Tesla’s (TSLA) ability to capture consumers’ attention and captivate their minds to Apple (AAPL). On Thursday during the unveiling of its all-electric driverless semi truck, Tesla took a page out of Apple’s, in particular Steve Jobs’ playbook, announcing “one more thing.” But before we get to that, Elon Musk, Tesla’s charismatic CEO, put a lot of pressure on himself and his company last Sunday by referring to the semi truck as a "beast" and "unreal," and proclaiming the sight of the vehicle "will blow your mind clear out of your skull and into an alternate dimension.” It’s tough to argue that Musk not only lived up to those expectations on Thursday, he in fact might have even understated what Street should have expected. At the event in Hawthorne, Calif. on Thursday Musk demoed the truck, which is on tap for production in 2019, showing features that include an average driving range of 500 miles per charge, which was twice the expected range Wall Street expected. That range is significant, Musk explained, adding that 80% of truck deliveries currently on the road today drive 250 miles or less. In terms of speed, not only can the truck can travel from zero to 60 miles per hour in 5 seconds, Musk gushed at the fact that it can maintain 60 miles per hour up a 5% grade, which is 20 miles per hour faster than today’s diesel trucks. What’s more, the truck will also carry a maximum payload of 80,000 pounds, which is the maximum load for U.S. highways. And not only does he promise the truck to have faster acceleration, it will feature better uphill performance. Given its low center of gravity, the trucks will be the safest ever to hit the road, Musk noted. Adding that the truck’s design, along with technology designed to prevent jackknifes, will significantly reduce the risk of rollovers. “Your worst nightmare is gone with this truck,” Musk said. All told, when taking these feature into account, Musk pointed out that it will cost companies 20% less per mile to operate, he called it  “economic suicide” for to continue using diesel trucks. “You’re earning 50% more per mile than in a diesel truck,” he said. If the excitement surrounding the truck was not enough, Musk surprised everyone with “one more thing,” unveiling a new Roadster, which he described as the “fastest production car ever made.” It’s likely the car stole some of the oomph from the truck, pushing Tesla stock up more than 4% in Friday’s pre-market session. See video here: https://twitter.com/Tesla/status/931409569640677376/video/1 As if on cue, the car, which can go from zero to 60 miles per hour in under two seconds and has a range of almost 621.4 miles, emerged from the back of one of the trucks. “The point of this is just to give a hardcore smackdown to gasoline cars,” Musk said during the event. “Driving a gasoline sports car is going to feel like a steam engine with a side of quiche.” As for the “one more thing”: It seems Musk was intent on giving a smackdown of his own to the company’s doubters. He did that, and then some, on Thursday. At the time of publication, the author held shares in Tesla.

GM Challenges Tesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) Electric Cars $GM, $TSLA, $F General Motors (NYSE:GM) plans to launch a new family of EVs in Y 2021 that will cost less to build and make a profit for the US #1 automaker, CEO Mary Barra told investors Wednesday. Her plans represent a direct challenge to money-losing electric vehicle specialist Tesla Inc, (NASDAQ:TSLA) which is struggling to get its more affordable, high-volume Model 3 launched and recently reported its largest-ever quarterly loss. “We are committed to a future electric vehicle portfolio that will be profitable,” CEO Barra said at the Barclays Global Automotive Conference in New York. Electric and Autonomous Vehicles, aka as EVs and AVs are widely seen as the Keystones of future transport, but Tesla, Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F), and other manufacturers are still working out how to make money on them. GM is looking to break out of that pattern by developing an all-new electric vehicle platform that will accommodate multiple sizes and segments, to be sold by different GM brands in the United States and China, CEO Barra said, adding new details to GM’s aggressive electrification strategy. In early October, GM said it planned to launch 20 new electric vehicles by Y 2023, but did not provide specifics. In comparison, rival Ford has said it plans to introduce 13 “electrified” vehicles, mostly hybrid gasoline-electric models by Y 2022. CEO Barra said GM aims to be selling 1-M electric vehicles a year by Y 2026, many of them in China, which has set strict production quotas on such vehicles. GM’s cost reduction efforts on electric vehicles center on a new battery system that will be more than 30% cheaper than the 1 that powers the Chevrolet Bolt. The company aims to cut the cost of its lithium-ion batteries to less than $100 per kilowatt-hour from $145 per kilowatt-hour by Y 2021, which would bring the overall cost of electric vehicles much closer to comparable gasoline-engine models. GM said the new batteries would hold more energy and charge faster. The company is aiming to boost electric vehicle range to more than 300 miles (483 km) with the new batteries. The current Bolt is rated at 238 miles between charges. CEO Barra said GM will have the ability to manufacture high volumes of the new batteries at plants in the United States and China. She said GM projects sales of 1-M electric vehicles a year by Y 2026. So far, the company has sold only 17,000 Bolts. GM’s new electric vehicle platform in Y 2021 will serve as a base for at least 9 derivatives, ranging from a compact crossover to a large 7-passenger luxury sports utility vehicle and a large commercial van. It will also provide the underpinning for a shared autonomous vehicle (AV) that GM plans to put into commercial service in Y 2021. GM plans to introduce three new electric vehicles by Y 2020, including 2 crossovers, that will share basic components with the Bolt. She described GM as “the only fully integrated developer of AVs with true scale capability.” “We are not capital constrained in our EV or AV development,” she added. GM is generating strong profit from selling trucks and sport utility vehicles in the United States, and CEO Barra reaffirmed a promise to investors that GM’s core North American vehicle business should achieve 10% pre-tax profit margins. Have a terrific weekend.   AV, battery, cost, electric, EV, F, Ford, General Motors, GM, platform, profit, Tesla, TSLA  GM Challenges Tesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) Electric Cars added by Paul Ebeling on November 17, 2017View all posts by Paul Ebeling → 

https://investorplace.com/2017/11/why-market-is-losing-confidence-in-tesla/

Suddenly, there are some cracks in the armor at Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA). The TSLA stock price has dipped about 2o% from mid-September highs. Even with investors stepping in so far this month, I don’t think the decline has ended. As I’ve written many times before, the TSLA stock price is the barometer of an argument of what Tesla earnings will be next decade and beyond. Modeling those earnings comes down to confidence in Tesla’s products, quality and execution. And it’s starting to look like that execution seriously is being called into question. I asked in August if TSLA stock could survive any more broken promises. With Model 3 production the latest in a series of disappointments, that question seems more urgent than ever. The response from most TSLA bulls to the disappointing levels of Model 3 production is to advise patience. On this site in October, Luke Lango pointed out that production of the Model S and Model X started at similar levels. In both cases, early issues were fixed, and production schedules improved substantially and quickly. It’s a fair point, and it’s not as if Model 3 production is going to stay stuck at the three-per-day level cited for the beginning of the quarter. But the problem isn’t so much the nature of the ramp as the promises made. CEO Elon Musk guided for production of 1,500 Model 3 vehicles in Q3 as recently as August into the quarter. The figure instead was less than 300. And it’s just another in the series of broken promises from Tesla. “It’s just one quarter,” TSLA bulls say in response to the Q3 production miss. But it’s not. Second-half 2017 production was supposed to be 100-200 thousand, according to Musk in May 2016, as the Wall Street Journal pointed out last month. The company will wind up nowhere close. Musk said last October that there was no need for a capital raise for the Model 3. Tesla then issued stock in March, diluted shareholders and raised debt in August, though it framed that raise as simply providing a cash cushion. The point here is that while the bottleneck itself is a short-term problem — and a fixable one — it’s part of a broader pattern. Musk continues to overpromise and under deliver. At some point, that erodes the confidence investors hold in the company. Indeed, the debt issued in August already is selling below par, showing that risk-averse bondholders see the recent events as potentially meaningful. The problems aren’t limited to the Model 3. The Buffalo facility is behind schedule. SolarCity was barely mentioned on the Q3 conference call, and the promised solar roof tiles haven’t materialized. Increasingly, at least from my vantage point, the confidence in both Musk and Tesla is starting to fade.

"I would like to die on Mars. Just not on impact." -- Elon Musk Color Me Not Impressed It's no secret that I have long referred to Tesla (TSLA) as the surest short on Wall Street. I currently am flat the name, though I have both lost money earlier this year, and made it back more recently by selling these shares short. Having made my money back, I probably will not be trying to make a few bucks from that angle again any time soon. It's not that I think Tesla has suddenly turned into a profit-churning beast. It's more that Elon Musk is truly a tremendous salesman, and the folks... well, let's just say that they have become something like a cult following. There will be no way to fundamentally place any kind of value on this stock. It's all about the magic man's ability to raise money. Any future negative (or positive) bets will be done by way of the options market, therefore risking far less dough than I would by trading related equities. Truck, Yes. Convoy? Not for a While OK, maybe this is impressive. Musk introduced his new big rig Thursday night. The semi-autonomous tractor-trailer will be fast, we are talking zero to 60 mph in five seconds. That is much faster than existing standard diesel technology. The new trucks will be able to carry 80,000 pounds (the max allowed on U.S. highways) out to a range of 500 miles on a full charge. Musk explained that 80% of deliveries made by trucks in this country are for distances of less than 250 miles. There's more. While these trucks will be less dependent upon human drivers, saving time by reducing stops usually spent on refueling and human needs, the firm also guarantees that these vehicles will not break down for one million miles. This is an obvious appeal to the commercial trucking industry's bottom line. In a cost-cutting world, this all seems fantastic. The stock is indeed higher Friday morning as we progress through the wee hours. The folks love Musk. I have questions, though. Is there competition? Of course there is. TSLA trades at prices that would make one think that this firm will have a monopoly on electric vehicles on that final day. We know that this is ridiculous. Just about everyone is either manufacturing an electric car at this point, and on top of that, just about every auto manufacturer and many tech companies are working on their own autonomous driving systems. Why do you think I pound the table so often for both Nvidia (NVDA) and Intel (INTC) ? By the way, Huang and Krzanich ... now, those two are CEOs. This is indeed where the future of the American road is headed. That road will, however, be crowded with competitors. In fact, Daimler -- a far more experienced manufacturer in the trucking space -- already has autonomous trucks on U.S. roads in the southwest. Tesla is behind Daimler in this space. No joke. Action Alerts PLUS charity portfolio holding Alphabet (GOOGL) is also considered to be closing in. Oh, don't worry, Elon Musk says that this new vehicle is set for production by 2019. He does have a track record on meeting production goals, doesn't he? It ain't pretty. King Midas Remember August? Just three months ago, Tesla went to market with $1.8 billion worth of debt. These senior notes sold for a yield of 5.3%. Recently, these same bonds had worked their way up to yields of more than 6.3%. Nice performance. (Not.) Yes, the stock is higher thanks to last night's dog and pony show, and that enthusiasm will likely extend itself out to the bond market. We all know that on Nov. 1, third-quarter results missed expectations for earnings per share. This was the third miss in four quarters for the firm in this space. We already know that delays for the Model 3 will weigh on early 2018 earnings. What does this mean? Well, to an untrained sloth like myself, running quarterly losses, and delayed prospects for revenue production mean increased cash burn. Increased cash burn could mean having to tap the debt markets again, earlier than expected. Hmm, but maybe those same investors, who might feel as if they were had back in August, will be less aggressive in bidding for any future offering. That's food for thought. Uh oh. Does Midas still have his touch? Tesla might have to come up with another way to raise cash, and it looks like they do have at least an idea. Fancy Shmancy Toward the end of last night's clam-bake, Tesla rolled out an updated electric roadster sports car designed in conjunction with Lotus. Zero to 60 in less than two seconds. The expected base price will be $200,000, with a deposit of $50,000. The obvious intent, at least from my perspective here, is to take advantage of some rich people who will mindlessly spend money on anything as a way to drive some revenue without hitting the debt market, and without diluting the shares. Production here is expected to begin in 2020. Just Wait a Second So we have a firm that has failed to meet production goals for its main effort, the Model 3. Then, the next priority would be the Model Y compact SUV. Then, this firm thinks it is going to launch the truck by 2019, and then this new sports car by 2020. LOL. Can you say "full plate"? At the very least an ambitious plan for a firm with an awful track record for meeting goals. Tesla has burned through more than $4.0 billion over the past year. Estimates are that producing the truck alone will require upfront investment of $1.7 billion. In order to gear up for Model 3 production, as well as the production of the associated batteries, the firm either borrowed, or issued shares that raised as much as $5.4 billion in this same past year... I don't know. What I do know is that I tried to look at this firm through the prism of fundamental analysis, which is not how this thing trades. Time will tell. Competition will be fierce, but only if the market is actually there. Chart of the Day: TSLA First off, I want you cognizant of the fact that TSLA is the only stock in our universe that I have consistently shorted. I am flat right now, but am aware of the possibility that I am capable of negative bias, and it could be inherent in my work regarding this name. I have profited most recently by being short, but that has not always been the case. Come to your own conclusions here. For starters, we can see that the flow of money has been weak, not just since earnings, but for the better part of two months. Relative strength is now off oversold levels, and is likely to show short-term strength on Friday. You can also see the bullish signal sent by the 12-day exponential moving average (EMA) cross over of the 26-day EMA. While this is positive, they both remain severely negative in comparison to the nine-day. That could matter if the stock were to hit a wall of resistance at some point on Friday. As to the larger models, you can see that a 38.2% retracement level worked as support back in July. The same level was recently tested coming off of the double top of September, and things became a bit sloppy. The name looks to break out of the medium-term Pitchfork model on Friday, and will likely pierce the upper trend line upon the opening bell. Should that line become support, there is a chance that this recent negative trend has been turned. That will allow for prices of 321 or even higher. However, if that trend line fails -- as I suspect it will, once the euphoria of last night's circus fades -- a 50% retracement down to $281 seems very realistic.   Those with a strong stomach might even reach for $260. I will not act on this name on Friday, and when I do, it will be through options, not equity. Too much human emotion involved here. On That Note I bet all of you noticed the passage of the House version of the tax reform bill on Thursday. The broad rally across the U.S. equity markets was clearly driven by risk-on behavior, leaving behind only energy shares as well as the bond proxies. No doubt, the spark was earnings success. The markets cheered for Cisco Systems (CSCO) as that firm beat expectations and raised its numbers. The markets really cheered for Walmart (WMT) , as that firm has truly proven to be the tough kid who will wait by the flagpole for Amazon (AMZN) to leave the building after school, while slowly pounding his fists. Still, did you see the rush to buy high yield corporate bonds? The iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (HYG) showed signs of bottoming on Wednesday, and really took off on Thursday. HYG is now up 1.5% from those Wednesday morning lows. What seems clear is that markets, though we may feel somewhat disappointed in what the House accomplished yesterday, are pricing corporate tax reform back into their models. Notice the simultaneous outperformance of the Russell 2000 (small caps), or the Transports. Where there's smoke, there's fire. Progress in the Senate could actually complete the movement for the HYG ETF back to the levels seen in late October. Then again, the Senate is a dog far trickier to deal with than is the House. Fun to had by all during a holiday-shortened week. No doubt. Sarge's Trading Levels These are my levels to watch today for where I think that the S&P 500, and the Russell 2000 might either pause or turn. SPX: 2603, 2597, 2590, 2584, 2576, 2567 RUT: 1509, 1501, 1492, 1483, 1475, 1468 Today's Earnings Highlights (Consensus EPS Expectations) Before the Open: (ANF) ($0.21), (BKE) ($0.38) After the Close: (FL) ($0.80) At the time of publication, Stephen Guilfoyle had no positions in the stocks mentioned.

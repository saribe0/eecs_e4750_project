 From Barrow to Florida, UAA is spanning the globe, or at least North America, to find talent for its sports teams.  The latest athletes to make UAA their college of choice come from one end of the continent to the other.  The Seawolves on Thursday announced the signing of six high school athletes, including two from Alaska who are at the top of their games.  Travis Adams, a savvy 5-foot-10 point guard from Barrow, is joining the men's basketball team, and Jacob Moos, the six-time state running champion from Galena, is joining the cross country and track teams.  Also committing to UAA:  — Volleyball players Eve Stephens of Colony and Ellen Floyd of Pensacola, Florida.  Stephens is a 6-foot middle blocker who led Colony to two straight Northern Lights Conference titles, and Floyd is a 5-9 setter who guided Pensacola Catholic to four straight state tournaments. Floyd comes with a big Alaska connection — she's part of Kodiak's famous Floyd family of coaches and athletes.  — Runners Drew Johnson of Littleton, Colorado, and Brock Helvey of Castle Rock, Colorado.  Johnson owns track personal-bests of 4 minutes, 27.3 seconds at 1,600 meters and 9:57.66 at 3,200. Helvey's PRs include a 9:22.23 in the 3,200, 4:23 in the 1,600, 1:55.66 in the 800 and 51.3 in the 400.  Moos represents a big catch for the Seawolves.  [Galena's Moos puts on show at state cross country]  At the 5-kilometer race at the state high school championships in October, he repeated as the Class 1-2-3A champion in 15:33, beating the winning time in the Class 4A race for bigger schools by 34 seconds.  On the track, his personal-bests are 9:19.66 in the 3,200 and 4:20.68 in the 1,600.  At UAA, Moos will be reunited with friend and former Galena teammate Kaleb Korta, a sophomore for the Seawolves.  Adams is another big recruit for the Seawolves and is the second Class 3A hoops star this week to commit to UAA. On Monday, 3A Player of the Year Tobin Karlberg, a high-scoring guard for Grace Christian, signed his letter of intent.  Adams and Karlberg give the Seawolves a promising backcourt tandem, coach Rusty Osborne said.  "With the addition of Travis, we have a very talented core group of young guards who we feel all complement one another," Osborne said in a press release. "They should lead our program for the next 4-5 years."  Adams enters his senior season with nearly 1,200 career points and 450 career assists for the Whalers. He and University of Texas-bound center Kamaka Hepa carried Barrow to state championships in 2014 and 2015, and Adams was a member of Barrow's state-champion football team this season.  "I have wanted to play college basketball my whole life so it is a dream come true," Adams said in a Twitter direct message. "And it is even more exciting because my family and all of my supporters in Barrow & Alaska can watch and keep supporting me.  "For Barrow I think it means a lot. I hope me signing (with) UAA will make me a role model in the town for younger kids who look up to me to want to further (their) basketball career (and) also get an education while doing it."  Adams said he picked UAA because the coaching staff began recruiting him during his sophomore year.  "Also every time I spoke with any of the coaches it felt like they cared about me not just on the court but off the court also," he said.  [UAA's hat trick of recruits is an interesting (and familiar) bunch]  Familiarity with other Seawolves made a difference too, he said. He and Karlberg are close friends, Adams said, "and have talked about playing with each other in college for awhile now."  The northern-most town in North America, more than 700 air miles from Anchorage, Barrow is a basketball-crazy place. Adams said UAA keeps him relatively close to home, and will allow Whalers fans to follow him at the college level.  "I think the town of Barrow is very happy with my decision," he said, "and I think they will keep on supporting me for years to come."

Source: Shutterstock For the past two years, calling a bottom in Under Armour Inc (NYSE:UAA) stock has been a losing man’s game. It will remain so until UAA stock comes down a lot more. The valuation on UAA stock remains unreasonably rich. The brand is showing no signs of executing a turnaround strategy. Competitors Nike Inc (NYSE:NKE) and adidas AG (ADR) (OTCMKTS:ADDYY) are starting to aggressively up their games in the North American market, which is where Under Armour gets more than 75% of its revenues. That is a deadly combination for UAA stock. Over the next several months, barring some unforeseen catalyst, UAA stock will simply continue to grind lower. The UAA brand isn’t what it used to be two years ago. In 2015, Under Armour was a formidable competitor to Nike and Adidas. Today, Under Armour has fallen way behind Nike and Adidas in terms of popularity and market share. This isn’t going to change anytime soon. Under Armour simply doesn’t have any exciting products on the market that athletes want to wear. To understand this, just do simple channel checks on the websites of Foot Locker, Inc. (NYSE:FL) and Finish Line Inc (NASDAQ:FINL). Foot Locker’s best-selling Men’s Basketball shoe list is dominated by Nike and Jordan. Under Armour’s brand new Curry 4 is a few scrolls down. The Curry 4 is doing better at Finish Line, but the top-selling Men’s Basketball shoe list there is still dominated by Nike and Jordan. It’s worth noting that the Curry 4 just launched globally, so if things were going well on the demand side for Under Armour, it’d be the top-selling Men’s Basketball shoe everywhere. Meanwhile, you’d be hard-pressed to find an Under Armour shoe on Foot Locker’s best-selling Men’s Casual shoe list. Same with Finish Line’s best-selling Men’s Casual shoe list. The running picture is equally ugly for Under Armour. Adidas and Nike dominate Foot Locker’s best-selling Men’s Running shoe list. Under Armour, again, is nowhere to be found. The first Under Armour shoe on Finish Line’s best-selling Men’s Running shoe list is a few scrolls down. On to apparel: Under Armour shirts aren’t too popular at Foot Locker, while they clearly lag Nike and Jordan shirts at Finish Line. Same on the Men’s Hoodie and Sweatshirt front. All in all, it is clear to see that an Under Armour turnaround isn’t going to happen anytime soon. When Under Armour was an iconic brand back in 2015, its products were found everywhere on the aforementioned best-selling lists. Today, they aren’t found anywhere.

Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE:UAA) is in the highlights and many would want to know whether now might be a good time for it to present much upside. Now trading with a market value of 5.03B, the company has a mix of catalysts and obstacles that spring from the nature of its operations. As the day-to-day narrative ebbs and flows for this company, it is more important than ever to step back and get a bird’s eye view of the fundamental reality under the surface of this story. Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE:UAA) Fundamentals That Matter It’s generally a good idea to start with the most fundamental piece of the picture: the balance sheet. The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For UAA, the company currently has 258 million of cash on the books, which is offset by 297 million in current liabilities. The trend over time is important to note. In this case, the company’s debt has been growing. The company also has 4.13 billion in total assets, balanced by 2.03 billion in total liabilities, which should give you a sense of the viability of the company under any number of imagined business contexts. Under Armour, Inc. (UAA) saw -25.08 million in free cash flow last quarter, representing a quarterly net change in cash of 92.32 million. Perhaps most importantly where cash movements are concerned, the company saw about 33.58 million in net operating cash flow.

 Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE:UAA) Revenue Growth Potential As far as key trends that demonstrate something of the future investment potential of this stock, we need to take a closer look at the top line, first and foremost. Last quarter, the company saw 1.41 billion in total revenues. That represents a quarterly year/year change in revenues of -0.04 in sequential terms, the UAA saw sales decline by 0.29. But what about the bottom line? After all, that’s what really matters in the end. Under Armour, Inc. (UAA) is intriguing when broken down to its core data. The cost of selling goods last quarter was 760.37 million, yielding a gross basic income of 645.25 million. For shareholders, given the total diluted outstanding shares of 448.44 million, this means overall earnings per share of 0.12. Note, this compares with a consensus analyst forecast of 0.01 in earnings per share for its next fiscal quarterly report. 
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Is Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE:UAA) Valuation Attractive Looking ahead at valuations, according to the consensus, the next fiscal year is forecast to bring about 0.23 in total earnings per share. If we consider a median price to earnings ratio on the stock, that corresponds with a stock price of 54.43. However, one should always remember: the trends are more important than the forecasts. This continues to be an interesting story, and we look forward to updating it again soon on Under Armour, Inc..

The company saw 0.9 million shares trade hands over the course of the day. Given that its average daily volume over the 30 days has been 1.49 million shares a day, this signifies a pretty significant change over the norm.  Analysts are speculating a 30.26% move, based on the high target price ($1350) for the shares that is set to reach in the next 12 months. The analysts, on average, are forecasting a $1176.31 price target, but the stock is already up 37.57% from its recent lows. However, the stock is trading at -2.56% versus recent highs ($1063.62). Analysts believe that we could see stock price minimum in the $990 range (lowest target price), allowing for another -4.48% drop from its current position. Leading up to this report, we have seen a 2.51% rise in the stock price over the last 30 days and a 11.72% increase over the past 3 months. Overall, the share price is up 30.79% so far this year. Additionally, GOOGL had a day price range of $1030.76 to $1039.63.  Heading into the stock price potential, Alphabet Inc. needs to grow just 13.85% to cross its median price target of $1180. In order to determine directional movement, the 50-day and 200-day moving averages for Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) are $1007.8 and $969.6. Given that liquidity is king in short-term, GOOGL is a stock with 691.67 million shares outstanding that normally trades 0.41% of its float. The stock price recently experienced a 5-day loss of -2.07% with 14.75 average true range (ATR). GOOGL has a beta of 0.92 and RSI is 60.08.

The stock witnessed -23.91% declines, -30.32% declines and -34.3% declines for the 1-month, 3-month and 6-month period, respectively. To measure price-variation, we found UAA’s volatility during a week at 4.48% and during a month it has been found around 5.03%.  Under Armour, Inc. (UAA) exchanged hands at an unexpectedly low level of 4.66 million shares over the course of the day. Noting its average daily volume at 6.08 million shares each day over the month, this signifies a pretty significant change over the norm.  The market experts are predicting a 93.39% rally, based on the high target price ($24) for Under Armour, Inc. shares that is likely to be hit in the 52 weeks. Analysts anticipate that traders could see stock price minimum in the $8 range (lowest target price). If faced, it would be a -35.54% drop from its current position. Overall, the share price is down -57.28% year to date.

UAA, which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further confirms weakness in UAA.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen 19 estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revisions.

This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from 37 cents a share a month ago to its current level of 21 cents.Also, for the current quarter, Under Armour has seen 17 downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 2 cents a share from 21 cents over the past 30 days.   The stock has also seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 24.4% in the past month.

As of the end of October 2017, the University of Alaska Anchorage introduced the addition of a new Associate Athletic Director of Development. Now a part of the athletic’s 13-sport community, Tanya Pont took over the responsibility for donor development and relations. Pont brings a significant amount of experience and knowledge to UAA as she has previously worked in a related field for over 18 years at SMG of Alaska, Inc. SMG was the management corporation that previously employed Pont as the Director of Marketing, but due to the recent budgetary issues, Pont and Joe Wooden, former general manager of the Sullivan Arena, were both dismissed in Aug. 2017. At SMG, Pont had a broad range of responsibilities and connections that will now help facilitate her career at UAA. Pont was appointed to be in charge of coordination of promotions, advertising campaigns, internal and external communications, public relations functions and media buys relative to the Sullivan Arena and its public events. For UAA, Pont’s experience will not only benefit current athletic community members, but future ones as well. “I volunteer for many local organizations that benefit youth athletics and support education,” Pont said. “These are my passions. I understand that, as a community, we need to work together to ensure opportunities for our children. In my new position at UAA, I can move this passion forward to help ensure that my children may have a chance to represent the hometown team.” Pont will not only work to develop relationships with future athletes, but past athletes as well. “I am working with Alumni Relations on a campaign to better engage alumni student-athletes. In order for UAA Seawolf Athletics to continue to be competitive in their respective sports and in the classroom, it is important to have a partnership with those alumni that have realized the benefit of graduating in green and gold,” Pont said. In addition to relevant experience, Pont has a B.S. in Corporate Communications that she obtained from the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs (1994-1998). Pont should be able to initiate communications and marketing strategies for the Alaska Airlines Center clients due to her experience establishing relationships with new business prospects, while continuing existing customer relations and support. At her previous job, Pont accumulated many specific successes that could transfer over as experience to UAA. “There were other events that we helped to bring to Alaska, including Nitro Circus, but one of the most satisfying accomplishments was being able to coordinate with local charity organizations to host a community holiday gift distribution center,” Pont said. Pont heightened community engagement and revenue through successful public relations campaigns. “I have a prior working relationship with UAA Athletics, having served on event committees for the GCI Great Alaska Shootout and Kendall Hockey Classic, and acting as their event logistical contact for events hosted at the Sullivan Arena. I have also developed relationships over the years with many of UAA’s key donors and alumni base,” Pont said.  Her previous achievements and future goals for UAA have already been recognized and acknowledge by other athletic department and UAA faculty. “We are pleased to add a seasoned professional like Tanya [Pont] to the UAA Athletics team. Her wealth of experience and knowledge in the Anchorage-area market is a great asset,” Tim McDiffett, interim athletic director, said.  In addition to her practical experience in a professional work environment, Pont joins the athletic department with valuable collegiate athletic experience. During her time at UC Colorado Springs, Pont participated as a dual collegiate athlete in both basketball and softball.

David McNew/ Getty    Shares of Walmart are slipping, down 0.64% at $90.51 a piece, ahead of its third-quarter earnings report, which is scheduled to be released before the market opens on Thursday. Wall Street is expecting adjusted earnings of $0.97 per share on revenue of $121 billion. Sentiment on Wall Street is mixed ahead of the results, with 15 of the 36 analysts polled by Bloomberg rating the company a "buy," 17 rating it a "hold" and two rating it a "sell." The company has recently made a push to win the holiday season by throwing events around its stores and setting up demonstration areas where kids can try out toys. It is also offering significant discounts in stores and online, as well as instituting a new two-day free shipping policy with a $35 online purchase and a discount when customers pick up items at its stores.  Like many big department store retailers, Walmart is contending with the rise of e-commerce and Amazon. Walmart recently announced that it would add "high-fashion" outlet Lord & Taylor and its many designer brands to its website in a push to reach a wealthier segment of the population. Last year, Walmart acquired Jet.com for $3.3 billion in a bid to reach Jet's younger and wealthier shoppers. Jet's former CEO Marc Lore became Walmart's head of e-commerce and under his tenure, he snapped up online startups, such as Bonobos, Moosejaw, ShoeBuy and ModCloth. Lore said that Walmart has a solid strategy to go up against Amazon. The company not only has 90% of the US population within 10 miles of its stores, it also provides a unique, overall experience both online and in its stores, he said. Oppenheimer Analyst Rupesh Parikh maintains that the company is poised to benefit from the brick-and-mortar turmoil that has rocked its industry, with Sears Holdings announcing new store closures and Toys R' Us filing for bankruptcy. He is bullish on the stock, raising his price target to $100 from $90. "We would expect WMT to pick up share and also gain clout with key vendors as they seek to ensure adequate brick & mortar distribution," Parikh wrote in a note. Walmart shares are up 31.88% this year.

Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE: WMT) shares are trading higher by $9.17 at $99.00 in Thursday's session. The catalyst for the rally is a Q3 EPS beat of 3 cents along with a $2.2 billion beat for sales. The company also raised FY 2018 guidance. After a higher open, far above its former all-time high of $90.97, Walmart had a brief retreat to $94.72 before continuing its move higher. It rallied all the way to $99.41 and is attempting to remain in the $99.00 handle. Posted-In: Technicals Intraday Update Movers Trading Ideas © 2017 Benzinga.com.

Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT)   On Thursday, November 16th, 2017, Walmart stores reported their fiscal quarterly earnings before the market open for trading.  Walmart reported revenue of +$1.23 billion dollars which compares with +$1.21 billion dollars in the year-ago period. Earnings came in at $1 per share after adjustments, while analysts had been expecting $0.97 per share.  However, it was in the U.S.-based internet and e-commerce area that saw the biggest and most lucrative increase which came in at +50%.  The above price chart is the daily action going back about 6 months. Today’s candle in the far upper right corner shows the power behind the move.  The above price chart shows the pre-market gap up in shares on the left and then the regular trading session on the right in all black. Walmart followed a clear up-trend all day, with every minor dip finding buyers and support levels. Barclays analyst Karen Short wrote this in a note to staff and others who follow Wal-Mart. “To use an analogy from a savvy client: A wall went up on June 16th. As a food retailer, you were either on the right or wrong side of the wall. In our view, WMT was clearly on the right side, but even prior to June 16th, WMT had made significant progress in changing the narrative by evolving its capabilities as a dominant omni-channel retailer, so from our perspective, historical valuation ceased to matter on June 16th.” Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. operates retail stores in various formats worldwide. It operates through three segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International, and Sams Club. The company operates discount stores, supermarkets, supercenters, hypermarkets, warehouse clubs, cash and carry stores, home improvement stores, specialty electronics stores, apparel stores, drug stores, convenience stores, and membership-only warehouse clubs; and retail Websites, such as walmart.com and samsclub.com, as well as mobile commerce applications.

Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) is an interesting player in the Services space, with a focus on Discount, Variety Stores. The stock has been active on the tape, currently trading at $90.99, up from yesterday’s close by 0.08%. Given the stock’s recent action, it seemed like a good time to take a closer look at the company’s recent data. Fundamental Analysis It’s important to get a feel for how any stock is actually valued on the market based on its core numbers. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) currently trades with a market capitalization of $269.95 Billion. That value represents a market adjusting for revenues that have been growing by 2.07 % on a quarterly year/year basis as of the company’s last quarterly report. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For WMT, the company currently has $6.47 Billion of cash on the books, which is offset by $7.17 Billion current liabilities. You can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $17.54 Billion over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to grow in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $0.97 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 32.52% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors. Technical Analysis We’ve taken a serious look at this stock from a fundamental perspective, but the tale of the tape may offer more hints about what lies under the surface. Looking at the stock’s movement on the chart, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. recorded a 52-week high of $91.69. It is now trading 0.7% off that level. The stock is trading $83.71 its 50-day moving average by -7.28%. The stock carved out a 52-week low down at $65.28. In recent action, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) has made a move of +6.12% over the past month, which has come on weak relative transaction volume. Over the trailing year, the stock is underperforming the S&P 500 by 19.32, and it’s gotten there by action that has been less volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. In terms of the mechanics underlying that movement, traders will want to note that the stock is trading on a float of 3.12% with $1.41 Billion sitting short, betting on future declines. That suggests something of the likelihood of a short squeeze in shares of WMT.

 Premium technical services company Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.JEC is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 (ended Sep 30, 2017) results before the market opens on Nov 21.
 The company's earnings in third-quarter fiscal 2017 came in at 79 cents, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the company delivered a positive average earnings surprise of 4.77%, over the preceding four quarters. Over the last month, Jacobs' shares yielded a return of 0.5%, as against the 1.8% loss incurred by the industry .   Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement. Factors at Play Elevated infrastructure spending in the United States and recovering economic conditions in China (a major industrial end-market) are anticipated to boost demand for Jacobs' premium engineering and construction management services, going forward. The company also believes its strategic restructuring moves will continue to reduce it operational costs in the near term. In addition to the above, Jacobs has been steadily enhancing its business and brand status on the back of prestigious contract wins. In the last few months, the company has secured several contracts from renowned institutions and public-sector agencies like the Shell Oil Company, Chevron Products Company, the U.S. Army, EQUATE Petrochemical Company, TransCanada Corporation and Sellafield Ltd. Notably, higher transportation spending of the government authorities of Australia, the U.K. and the United States has largely increased Jacobs' contract winning opportunities. However, turbulence in the oil and gas market is expected to hurt the company's Petroleum & Chemicals segment's performance in the quarter to be reported and even after. Moreover, disappointing field services revenues might adversely affect the company's Industrial segment's business. Jacobs also believes reduced public spending in the U.K. will thwart its revenues and profitability in the fiscal fourth quarter. We also fear that other headwinds such as intense industry rivalry or adverse foreign currency translation impact might weigh over Jacobs' top- and bottom-line performances in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.
 Based on the current market conditions, the company projects earnings in the range of $3.00-$3.15 per share for fiscal 2017.Earnings Whispers
 Our proven model does not conclusively show that Jacobs is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as we will see below. Zacks ESP: Jacobs currently has an Earnings ESP of -3.11%. This is because the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 83 cents is higher than the Most Accurate estimate of 80 cents.  Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. Quote You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter . Zacks Rank: Jacobs carries a favorable Zacks Rank #2 but a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult. It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks that Warrant a Look Here are some stocks within the industry that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat: KB Home KBH , with an Earnings ESP of 0.33% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .
 Winnebago Industries, Inc. WGO , with an Earnings ESP of +1.91% and a Zacks Rank #1. TRI Pointe Group, Inc. TPH , with an Earnings ESP of +0.39% and a Zacks Rank #2.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside? Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana. Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

To say that Allergan Plc Ordinary Shares (NYSE:AGN) has had a bad second half of the summer is an understatement. Coming into this earnings report, and since its last earnings report in July, the stock had fallen 30%. On this morning’s earnings report the stock dropped about 2% after the open before rebounding. I am a strong believer in the fact that the short-term reaction to earnings is more gambling than investing. We never know what traders will do, regardless of the quality of the numbers. At these levels, something had to give for AGN stock. It has been lagging the sector. Year-to-date the iShares NASDAQ Biotechnology Index (ETF) (NASDAQ:IBB) is up 19% while AGN down 17%, so it has some catching up to do. Wall Street experts expected a lot of it and set the benchmarks high. As of yesterday, it was trading 27% below the average price target and a whopping 35% below the high. It was even trading 10% below the lowest of analyst expectations. Usually when the price targets are this wrong, the experts reset their expectations. That usually comes in the form of bearish headlines. Luckily, most analysts already are holding pat on the stock. So since they have not been overzealous with their action ratings, the odds of a deluge of downgrades are low. Technically, $160/$180 zone has been pivotal since 2013 when it served as a launching pad for a massive rally. Now it should provide some support. Often what was resistance because forward support. The worry there is that the loss of $190 per share could have triggered a large head and shoulder-like bearish pattern which would target $140 per share. This is not a forecast but I do have to recognize it exists.

Latest evolution in the price of Allergan plc (NYSE:AGN) stock has been one of the most talked about matter among the interested investors. Analysts often use price and volume data to predict future stock performance. In the case of AGN, the chart has some interesting things to say about where the stock might be headed. How has the stock performed recently? Allergan plc (NYSE:AGN) in the last month has decreased -15.52%. Shares are now up over the past year, outperforming the broad market by -100% and underperformed a peer group of similar companies by -244%. After the latest session, which saw the stock close at a price of $177.23, AGN sits below its 52-week high. Allergan plc (NYSE:AGN) has been trading in a bearish manner, based on the relative positions of the stock’s 20 and 200 day moving averages. Momentum indicators 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that AGN may be headed in the future. Fortunately, there is way to use the speed and magnitude of these price changes to predict future performance, thanks to what are known as momentum indicators. As momentum slows, it might be a sign that a support or resistance level has been reached, and that a trend is about to reverse. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for AGN is 27.17%, which suggests that the stock may be primed for a trend reversal or a breakout to the upside. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 9.06%, tells a similar story, and suggests that AGN currently trades in oversold territory. What do the trading volumes reveal? Volume patterns can also be useful for predicting future performance. When trading activity is abnormally high, it’s often a sign that the market feels particularly strong in one way or another about the future direction of a stock. Allergan plc (AGN) average trading volume of 4,572,950 during the past month is 66% above its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been more active than usual in the stock in recent times. What do the analysts think? AGN is currently undervalued by -26.39% relative to the average 1-year price target of $240.78 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 2.20, which implies that analysts are generally neutral in their outlook for AGN over the next year. How risky is the stock?  In order to put AGN’s recent price performance into context, we need to get a sense of how the stock moves in relation to the overall market. Beta, which measures a stock’s price volatility relative to the market, provides the cleanest measure of systematic risk for a stock. Allergan plc (NYSE:AGN) has a beta of 1.14, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are more extreme than the market as a whole. AGN therefore has a above average level of market risk. During the past couple of weeks, AGN average daily volatility was 28.04%, which is -5.45 percentage points higher than the average volatility over the past 100 days.

Allergan plc’s AGN third-quarter 2017 earnings came in at $4.15 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.06 by 2.2%. Earnings rose 25% year over year as higher revenues offset higher costs. In the quarter, the company recorded an impairment charge of $4.1 billion, primarily related to Restasis and Aczone and another $1.3 billion in impairment charge related to losses on investment in Teva Pharma TEVA securities. Including these charges, the company reported a loss of $12.05 per share compared with a loss of $1.15 per share in the year-ago quarter. Last month, a Texas federal district court invalidated four of the six patents covering dry eye drug Restasis, Allergan’s second best-selling drug, potentially opening doors for early generic competition. Restasis patents are scheduled to expire in August 2024. However, a generic may be launched much earlier. Along with the earnings release, the company said that it has filed a notice of appeal with the court. The impairment charge for Restasis was in relation to this adverse ruling while that for Aczone was in response to generic pressure in the branded acne category. Revenues came in at $4.03 billion, up 11.4% from the year-ago period, and in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Key products like Botox and Restasis and new products like Vraylar, Namzaric and Viberzi did well in the quarter. However, sales erosion from Namenda XR and loss of exclusivity, mainly from Asacol HD and Minastrin hurt the top line. Third-quarter revenues also benefited from the addition of Alloderm from LifeCell (January) and CoolSculpting body contouring system from ZELTIQ (April) acquisitions Segment Discussion The company reports revenues under three segments – U.S. General Medicine, U.S. Specialized Therapeutics and International. U.S. Specialized Therapeutics’ net revenues increased 18.7% to $1.72 billion driven by continued strong performance of Botox and higher sales of Juvéderm Collection of fillers and Restasis. Botox (cosmetic) raked in sales of $189.7 million (up 8.7%). Botox Therapeutic revenues were $352.1 million, up 15.3%. In addition, Juvéderm Collection of fillers rose 10.1% and Ozurdex sales increased 17.7%, which contributed to the upside. Restasis sales rose 2.9% to $366.8 million in the quarter. Aczone sales declined 32.3% in the quarter to 46.7%. LifeCell’s Alloderm added $84.6 million while ZELTIQ’s CoolSculpting business added $83.4 million to sales in the third quarter. U.S. General Medicine net revenues were flat at $1.5 billion in the reported quarter with sales declining in the Diversified Brands and Women's Health franchises. Anti-Infectives sales rose 28% to $67.2 million, Gastrointestinal rose 2.8% to $443.5 million and Central Nervous System sales rose 9.1% to $355.2 million. Established products like Linzess and Lo Loestrin as well as new products like Namzaric and Vraylar did well in the quarter. Linzess’ sales rose 16.1% in the quarter to $190.9 million, driven by strong demand and favorable trade buying patterns. Lo Loestrin sales rose 13.5% to $120 million backed by strong prescription growth and higher selling prices. However, lower Namenda XR sales hurt the performance of the CNS franchise. Namenda XR sales declined 22.5% to $114.3 million in the quarter due to lower demand, lower pricing and shift of promotional efforts to Namzaric. Namzaric, a once-daily, fixed-dose combination of Namenda XR and Aricept, recorded sales of $37.0 million compared with $33.4 million in the previous quarter. Continued conversion from Namenda XR and higher demand following an expanded label with new dosages pulled up sales of Namzaric. Asacol/Delzicol sales declined 31.4% to $49.5 million due to a reduction in demand for Ascaol HD, following the launch of an authorized generic in August 2016 as well as lower demand for Delzicol. In the Women’s Health segment, Minastrin 24 revenues declined 95.8% to $3.6 million in the quarter due to loss of exclusivity in March. The International segment recorded net revenue of $807.8 million, up 13.7% from the year-ago period, driven by growth in Facial Aesthetics, Eye Care and the addition of CoolSculpting. Costs Rise Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses rose 9.2% to $1.10 billion in the quarter, primarily due to higher foreign exchange transactional losses and costs related to acquisitions. R&D expenses increased 4.9% to $405.3 million to support an advancing pipeline. 2017 Outlook Tightened The company narrowed its previously issued earnings and sales guidance for 2017. Allergan expects total revenue in the range of $15.875 billion to $16.025 billion compared with $15.85 billion to $16.05 billion previously. Adjusted earnings per share are expected in the range of $16.15–$16.45 compared with $16.05–$16.45 previously. Adjusted gross margin guidance was maintained in the range of approximately 86.5% and 87%. The company maintained its R&D and SG&A expenses guidance. R&D expenses are expected to be approximately $1.6 billion while SG&A spend is expected between $4.5 billion and $4.6 billion. Our Take Allergan’s third-quarter results were mixed as the company beat expectations for earnings while delivering in-line revenues. While the company slightly lowered its sales guidance, it raised the lower end of the earnings guidance. This probably boosted investor confidence at a time when Allergan is facing multiple challenges. Shares were up 1.5% in pre-market trading. So far this year, Allergan’s share price is down 15.6% compared with the industry’s decline of 29.4%. Allergan is facing patent challenges for quite a few of its products including Generess Fe, Namenda XR and Asacol HD. Other than the adverse ruling related to Restasis, Allergan also recently came under fire for entering into an agreement with the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe to protect Restasis from generic competition. Lawmakers questioned the unconventional move adopted by the company. The deal with the Tribe has basically raised concerns that it will curb generic competition in the pharmaceutical industry and discourage generic drug makers from making cheaper versions of expensive drugs. Meanwhile, new competition for key growth drivers, Restasis and Linzess, is an investor concern. Shire’s SHPG dry eye disease drug Xiidra, launched last year, is posing strong competition for Restasis. Meanwhile, Synergy Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s SGYP Trulance (plecanatide) has been launched this year for chronic idiopathic constipation, which could pose competition to Linzess. Nonetheless, Allergan’s products like Botox and Linzess and new products such as Viberzi and Vraylar support sales growth. It also boasts a strong branded pipeline while biosimilars also represent significant opportunity. Allergan carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Allergan PLC.

Zacks Equity Research
                    November 02, 2017
 FB NVDA AMAT JBL  Still reeling under the effects of the Russia ad fiasco and the subsequent Congress probe, Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report)	 came up with a stellar third-quarter 2017 performance. The company’s third-quarter 2017 earnings of $1.59 per share and revenues of $10.33 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.29 and $9.88 billion, respectively. On a year-over-year basis, revenues grew 47%. Facebook’s mobile and live video efforts continue to pay off big time. Instagram remains an important growth driver. COO Sheryl Sandberg said that video was emerging as an “exploding” opportunity. Given the phenomenal increase in mobile ad business and video efforts, the stock has vastly outperformed the broader market. In the past one year, Facebook’s shares have generated a return of 52.2%, compared with the industry’s gain of 31%.    However, the company said that operating margins will take a hit going forward as it will make sizable investments to strengthen security on its platform in light of recent developments. Also, expenses will rise due to investments made in video content to support Watch and development of augmented/ virtual reality (AR/VR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Additional spend on infrastructure to support and improve the available products will lead to a 100% increase in capex in 2018. These projections overshadowed the good show as shares fell 2% in the aftermarket session. CEO Mark Zuckerberg was quoted saying, “Our community continues to grow and our business is doing well. But none of that matters if our services are used in ways that don't bring people closer together. We're serious about preventing abuse on our platforms. We're investing so much in security that it will impact our profitability. Protecting our community is more important than maximizing our profits.” Quarterly Numbers in Details Revenues surged 45% from the prior-year quarter, excluding the impact of year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. Facebook’s consistently expanding user base remains one of its biggest growth catalysts. Its monthly active users (MAUs) were up 16% year over year to a staggering 2.07 billion. Daily Active Users (DAUs) were 1.37 billion, reflecting a 16% year-over-year increase. Advertising revenues were $10.14 billion, surging 49% year over year. Growth was driven by increasing mobile engagement, higher number of marketers and consistent investment in new products. Mobile ad revenues in the quarter were $8.9 billion (up 57% year over year), contributing 88% to total ad revenues. Ad impressions grew 10%, driven by surging mobile ad impressions on both Facebook and Instagram platforms. Average price per ad increased 35% from the year-ago quarter. Payments and other fees decreased 5% year over year to $186 million in the reported quarter, owing to a reduction in payment revenues related to PC games. Management expects revenues from this segment to decline further as PCs lose market share.  Cost and expenses increased 34% to $4.92 billion due to a rise in workforce and marketing expenses. However, robust revenue growth provided enough cushion to operating margins. Operating income of $5.1 billion grew 64% year over year. Operating margin was 50%, compared with 44% reported in the year-ago period. Facebook, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Facebook, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Facebook, Inc. Quote Balance Sheet & Cash Flow Facebook exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $38.29 billion. The company generated nearly $6.13 billion of cash flow from operating activities in the second quarter of 2017 compared with $4.04 billion in the year-ago period. Free cash flow was $4.37 billion compared with $2.94 billion in the year-ago quarter. The company incurred capital expenditure of $1.76 billion in the reported quarter. Outlook GAAP expenses are projected to increase in a band of 35­–40% compared with the earlier expected range of 40–45%. Capex is likely to be at the lower end of the earlier guided range of $7–$7.5 billion. For 2018, the company anticipates total expenses to increase 45% to 60% year over year while capex is expected to double from 2017 levels. At present, Facebook carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Other Stocks to Consider  Top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report)	 Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report)	, and Jabil Inc (JBL  -  Free Report)	. While NVIDIA Corp and Jabil sport a Zacks Rank #1, Applied Materials carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Long-term earnings growth rate for NVIDIA, Applied Materials and Jabil is currently projected to be 11.2%, 17.1% and 12%, respectively.

Allergan plc AGN will report third-quarter 2017 earnings on Nov 1, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.77%. Allergan’s share price has declined 14.1% this year so far, outperforming the 27.6% decline witnessed by the industry. Allergan’s earnings performance has been mixed so far, with the company beating expectations in three of the past four quarters and missing on one occasion. The average negative earnings surprise over the last four quarters is 0.36%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement. Factors to Consider At the Q2 call, Allergan had said that third-quarter revenues are expected to be at similar levels to the second quarter. Second-quarter revenues rose 8.8% year over year. Third quarter revenues are likely to be driven by new products like Vraylar, Namzaric and Viberzi, international growth and growth from key established products like Botox and Linzess. However, Namenda IR is facing generic competition, which will continue to hurt sales of the drug. Meanwhile, Namenda XR sales also declined in the previous quarters due to lower demand and shift of promotional efforts to Namzaric, a once-daily, fixed-dose combination of Namenda XR and Aricept. The company does not expect a generic version of Namenda XR to be launched until first quarter of 2018. Investors will be interested to find out how Namzaric performed in the quarter. Last quarter, Allergan saw improved sales of Namzaric due to continued conversion from Namenda XR and higher demand following an expanded label with new dosages. The positive trend is expected to continue. Meanwhile, the addition of Alloderm from LifeCell (Jan 2017) and CoolSculpting body contouring system from ZELTIQ (Apr 2017) acquisitions are likely to support the top line in the quarter. However, loss of exclusivity of Asacol HD and Minastrin may remain an overhang on the top line. Higher promotional expenses for key products, increased costs to support an advancing pipeline and the addition of lower margin LifeCell and ZELTIQ acquisitions can put pressure on Allergan’s margins. In fact, at the Q2 call, Allergan mentioned that SG&A and R&D expenses will be higher in the third quarter compared with the fourth quarter. Higher promotional activities, given the timing of new launches and continued strong promotion for key brands, are expected to lead to higher sales and marketing costs in the third quarter. Investors will also be keen to know management’s plans to protect Restasis, its second best-selling drug, from generic competition. Earlier this month, a Texas federal district court invalidated four of the six patents covering Restasis, potentially opening doors for early generic competition. Restasis patents are scheduled to expire on Aug 27, 2024. Allergan also came under fire recently for its agreement with the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe. Lawmakers questioned the unconventional move adopted by the company to protect Restasis from generic competition. The deal with the Tribe has basically raised concerns that it will curb generic competition in the pharmaceutical industry and discourage generic drugmakers from making cheaper versions of expensive drugs. Investors will also be interested to know the impact of new competition on Allergan’s key products – Restasis and Linzess. Shire’s SHPG dry eye disease drug Xiidra, launched last year, is posing strong competition for Restasis. Meanwhile, Synergy’s Trulance (plecanatide) was launched in the second quarter for CIC, which could pose competition to Linzess. Earnings Whispers Our proven model does not conclusively show that Allergan is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below. Zacks ESP: The Most Accurate estimate stands at $4.03, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at $4.06. This results in an Earnings ESP of -0.69%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks Rank: Allergan has a Zacks Rank #4. We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. Stocks to Consider Some stocks in the biotech/pharma sector that have a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank are: Acorda Therapeutics, Inc. ACOR, scheduled to release results on Oct 31, has an Earnings ESP of + 5.53% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Clovis Oncology, Inc. CLVS, scheduled to release results on Nov 1, has an Earnings ESP of +2.01% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside? Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.      Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

However, Namenda IR is facing generic competition, which will continue to hurt sales of the drug. Meanwhile, Namenda XR sales also declined in the previous quarters due to lower demand and shift of promotional efforts to Namzaric, a once-daily, fixed-dose combination of Namenda XR and Aricept. The company does not expect a generic version of Namenda XR to be launched until first quarter of 2018. Investors will be interested to find out how Namzaric performed in the quarter. Last quarter, Allergan saw improved sales of Namzaric due to continued conversion from Namenda XR and higher demand following an expanded label with new dosages. The positive trend is expected to continue. Meanwhile, the addition of Alloderm from LifeCell (Jan 2017) and CoolSculpting body contouring system from ZELTIQ (Apr 2017) acquisitions are likely to support the top line in the quarter. However, loss of exclusivity of Asacol HD and Minastrin may remain an overhang on the top line. Higher promotional expenses for key products, increased costs to support an advancing pipeline and the addition of lower margin LifeCell and ZELTIQ acquisitions can put pressure on Allergan’s margins. In fact, at the Q2 call, Allergan mentioned that SG&A and R&D expenses will be higher in the third quarter compared with the fourth quarter. Higher promotional activities, given the timing of new launches and continued strong promotion for key brands, are expected to lead to higher sales and marketing costs in the third quarter. Investors will also be keen to know management’s plans to protect Restasis, its second best-selling drug, from generic competition. Earlier this month, a Texas federal district court invalidated four of the six patents covering Restasis, potentially opening doors for early generic competition. Restasis patents are scheduled to expire on Aug 27, 2024. Allergan also came under fire recently for its agreement with the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe. Lawmakers questioned the unconventional move adopted by the company to protect Restasis from generic competition. The deal with the Tribe has basically raised concerns that it will curb generic competition in the pharmaceutical industry and discourage generic drugmakers from making cheaper versions of expensive drugs. Investors will also be interested to know the impact of new competition on Allergan’s key products – Restasis and Linzess. Shire’s SHPG dry eye disease drug Xiidra, launched last year, is posing strong competition for Restasis. Meanwhile, Synergy’s Trulance (plecanatide) was launched in the second quarter for CIC, which could pose competition to Linzess. Earnings Whispers Our proven model does not conclusively show that Allergan is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below. Zacks ESP: The Most Accurate estimate stands at $4.03, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at $4.06. This results in an Earnings ESP of -0.69%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks Rank: Allergan has a Zacks Rank #4. We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.

ACOR, scheduled to release results on Oct 31, has an Earnings ESP of + 5.53% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Clovis Oncology, Inc.

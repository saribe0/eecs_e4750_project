Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT) is an interesting player in the Technology space, with a focus on Semiconductor Equipment & Materials. The stock has been active on the tape, currently trading at $56.43, up from yesterday’s close by 0.95%. Given the stock’s recent action, it seemed like a good time to take a closer look at the company’s recent data. Fundamental Analysis No amount of research is complete without a bird’s eye view of the financial data. Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT) currently trades with a market capitalization of $60.44 Billion. That value represents a market adjusting for revenues that have been growing by 32.72 % on a quarterly year/year basis as of the company’s last quarterly report. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For AMAT, the company currently has $5.28 Billion of cash on the books. You can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $3.4 Billion over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to hold steady in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $0.91 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 81.91% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors. Technical Analysis No analysis is ever complete without a thorough survey of a stock’s technical behavior. Looking at the stock’s movement on the chart, Applied Materials, Inc. recorded a 52-week high of $56.82. It is now trading 0.39% off that level. The stock is trading $49.73 its 50-day moving average by -6.7%. The stock carved out a 52-week low down at $28.02. In recent action, Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT) has made a move of +8.85% over the past month, which has come on weak relative transaction volume. Over the trailing year, the stock is underperforming the S&P 500 by 22.64, and it’s gotten there by action that has been more volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. In terms of the mechanics underlying that movement, traders will want to note that the stock is trading on a float of 1.44% with $1.06 Billion sitting short, betting on future declines. That suggests something of the likelihood of a short squeeze in shares of AMAT.

After staying quite for a long time Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) shares have recently been behaving interestingly to keep investors awake. Many analysts use price trends and patterns to predict future performance, and we can glean some important insights about AMAT by examining the chart. How has the stock performed recently? Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) in the last month has increased +8.85%. Shares are now up over the past year, outperforming the broad market by -100% and outperformed a peer group of similar companies by 141%. After the latest session, which saw the stock close at a price of $56.43, AMAT sits below its 52-week high. Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) has been trading in a bullish manner, based on the relative positions of the stock’s 20 and 200 day moving averages. Momentum indicators 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that AMAT may be headed in the future. If we want to get a sense of AMAT’s future performance, we have to look at the speed and size of these price movements. Using what are known as momentum indicators, we can use the stock’s price momentum to get a sense of whether the stock is in the midst of, or nearing the end of, a current trend. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for AMAT is 69.53%, which suggests that the stock is not particularly expensive or cheap, and not predisposed to a reactive price movement based on this measure. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 92.07%, tells a different story, and suggests that AMAT currently trades in overbought territory. What do the trading volumes reveal? In addition to price, analysts use volume trends to predict future performance. The level of trading activity in a stock is often a good proxy for the level of interest and enthusiasm for the name within the investment community. A sudden increase in activity can be a sign that investors are trading in anticipation of a catalyst. Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT) average trading volume of 9,402,280 during the past month is 4.93% below its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been less active than usual in the stock in recent times. What do the analysts think? AMAT is currently undervalued by -5.79% relative to the average 1-year price target of $59.90 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 1.80, which implies that analysts are generally bullish in their outlook for AMAT over the next year. How risky is the stock?  Absolute price performance isn’t the only thing analysts consider when predicting future performance: volatility matters as well. Beta, which measures the stock’s volatility relative to the overall market, is a simple but effective metric for assessing risk. Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) has a beta of 1.83, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are more extreme than the market as a whole. AMAT therefore has a above average level of market risk. During the past couple of weeks, AMAT average daily volatility was 16.23%, which is 12.11 percentage points lower than the average volatility over the past 100 days.

Applied Materials, Inc. Technical Signals 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 AMAT has witnessed its short term MA triggering a sell signal. Meanwhile, however, the long-term average has generated a buy signal. When the short-run moving average rises above its longer-term trend, a buy signal is created. This is because a short-run moving average that crosses its long-run moving average counterpart is seen as the initiation of an upward trend. On additional rally, the share price will meet short term resistance at around $56.09. On a drop, the stock is likely to find some support over the long run, which begins at $51.63. A buy signal will be generated if it crosses above the short term moving average. Meanwhile, however, a price crossing below the long term moving average will generate a sell signal. Some other technical concerns emerged as well, putting in risk the future growth of the stock in the next couple of days. Its pivot point high generated sell signal on Friday October 27, 2017, which calls for additional declines until the stock forms a new pivot point low, as this could be a buying opportunity. The downbeat movement of both volume and price during the recent session is interpreted as a good sign because traders usually believe falling stock should see declining volume. Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) Support And Resistance Levels In case of pullback, the next support the price will capture from accumulated volume will not be far away from current price at $52.09 and $50.62. In case of gains, the next resistance from accumulated volume will not be far away from today’s level at $56.09, $56.37 and $56.69. 
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 It is important to note, however, that the stock needs to make its way through natural risk while testing a key support level. Once this support is broken, another support level will be to be established at a lower level. Turning back to this stock, Applied Materials approaches the first support point just current price at $52.09. In case of a break, the next support we will see from accumulated volume is going to be at $50.62 and $44.30. Accumulated volume is going to prevent the price from rising further at $56.09 and this action will lead the price to take a temporary pause or stay muted for a few days. Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT) Risk Assessment The number of shares changed hands in the stock is good, indicating the interest and low risk associated with it. In the most recent session, the stock price hovered around $1.02 (1.84%) between intraday high and intraday low. Each day in the past 1 week, the average volatility remained at 2.09%.

      ’ Analyst Day and the company delivered. Attendance this year, Applied Materials’ (ticker: AMAT) 50th anniversary, was one third higher than last year and last year was an all-time attendance record. I interpret that high attendance as highly confirming of the investment community’s increased interest in and focus on Applied Materials specifically, and the wafer fabrication equipment (WFE) sector broadly. The sector is going thru a secular shift and the investment and sell-side community are both sensing and witnessing it.   Artificial intelligence (AI) deserves a special mention in terms of being a burgeoning demand driver. A few highly salient points were made at the Analyst Day on the AI front and there was a whole panel discussion focused on AI. First, there are 10 times fewer chips per wafer for leading AI chips than for other standard chips. AI chips are big and incredibly robust and sophisticated. Second, while data growth is explosive, it is estimated that less than 1% of data is being analyzed. The amount of computing power and semiconductors/silicon necessary to start meaningfully analyzing all the data being generated in the world is enormous. Third, just looking at the amount of additional memory and computing power necessary for autonomous driving suggests exponential demand growth for 3D NAND with only 1% adoption of autonomous vehicles. Fourth, the shift from traditional enterprise servers to AI graphics processing unit (GPU)-based servers require eight times more logic per server and 4x more memory. Old expectations of how much share of WFE would go to lithography-based solutions (which would be particularly beneficial to

       (LRCX) and Tokyo Electron) have been meaningfully off the mark. Back in 2011 lithography equipment represented 25% of WFE spending and it was forecasted (by Gartner) to rise to 30%-plus by 2016). Today, lithography spending is less than 20% of total WFE spending. There are so many more steps and tools necessary in making cutting-edge semis, and lithography, while still critical, has become a lesser component of total spend. The outlook of multiyear visibility of highly robust demand and the need for the transition to advanced tools has arguably never looked better. The sell side has been consistently behind in its forecasts on Applied Materials. While the sell side is likely to inevitably catch up, the market is unlikely to wait for the laggards. Notably, the market has reacted with alacrity as it has digested Applied Materials’ presentation. The stock is up over 13% from the close on the day before the Analyst Day and appears to have broken out of the consolidation mode it had been in over the last few months despite reporting a tremendous fiscal third-quarter results and outlook in August. I believe that Applied Materials deserves to trade at at least a market multiple and more appropriately at a modest premium to a market multiple. I believe Applied Materials’ double-digit multiyear top-line forecasts combined with a likely 16%-plus multiyear earnings per share compounded annualized growth rate (CAGR), leading market position and it being one of the least-expensive ways to gain exposure to some of the most compelling trends in technology (AI, Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data, Cloud, Mobile, Smart Cars, Virtual/Augmented Reality, OLED, 68”-plus displays, etc.) suggests that Applied Materials warrants a 20 times EPS multiple on 2019 earnings. As I believe Applied Materials is likely to deliver about $5 in 2019 EPS, that suggests a warranted price for Applied Materials of $100 per share sometime in the next 12-24 months.

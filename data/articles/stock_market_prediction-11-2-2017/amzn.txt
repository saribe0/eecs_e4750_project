Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has registered three new domain names related to cryptocurrency, sparking speculation that the e-commerce giant may accept it as payments or even move into the space. They include: amazonethereum.com, amazoncryptocurrency.com and amazoncryptocurrencies.com. Amazon already signed up for the domain "amazonbitcoin.com" three years ago and the address takes you straight to Amazon.com. Now read: Amazon: Paging All Activists »

E-commerce giant Amazon has secured three domain names related to virtual currencies, giving air to the speculations that it might start its voyage into the cryptocurrency space. The three domain names—amazonethereum.com, amazoncryptocurrency.com and amazoncryptocurrencies.com— have been registered in the name of Amazon Technologies, Inc., the subsidiary of Amazon.com, Inc. The phone number provided to the registrar links to the legal department of the company. According to DomainNameWire which first reported about the development, the web domain names were registered on Tuesday. However, talking to CNBC last month, Amazon Pay's VP Patrick Gauthier told that the company had no plans to accept cryptocurrency because there hasn't been much demand yet. In 2013 as well, the company had secured a web domain amazonbitcoin.com which if entered into a web browser redirects to company’s website-Amazon.com. There have been multiple rumours about the company starting to accept cryptocurrencies. Last month, one such rumour that it will accept bitcoins for purchases drove bitcoin’s price upwards. In the last ten months, cryptocurrencies have seen a massive surge in their valuation. On Wednesday, bitcoin’s price reportedly breached USD 6,600 barrier for the first time.

Amazon's cloud business has become the company's gold-egg-laying goose.  For much of the last two years, Amazon Web Services — the company's cloud computing unit — has accounted for a sizeable chunk of Amazon's overall profits. But, as we can see in this chart from Statista, in three of Amazon's last five quarters it's done even more — it's covered over the red ink posted by Amazon's other segments and helped it turn a likely loss into a profit.  The company's most recent quarter is a case in point. The $1.2 billion operating profit posted by AWS wiped out the $936 million operating loss recorded by Amazon's international e-commerce business.   AWS, which dominates the cloud computing market, reported $4.6 billion in revenue in the third quarter, up from $3.2 billion in the same period last year, and is on track to post $18 billion in total revenues this year. Its success has helped keep the pressure off company CEO Jeff Bezos, whose longtime strategy has been to run Amazon's businesses at close to break even to gain market share. Indeed, Amazon's stock skyrocketed after its most recent quarterly report.   Mike Nudelman/Business Insider   NOW WATCH: A running coach explains the 2 most important activities runners should do to avoid knee pain See Also: SEE ALSO: Nintendo's Switch console is bringing back the good times at the company

Amazon has never particularly cared about hitting short-term earnings expectations. But when it does, investors go crazy. Shares of Amazon surged 8% in after-hours trading today (Oct. 26) after the company beat third-quarter expectations. Amazon reported $256 million in profit, roughly comparable to net income in the same quarter a year earlier. It generated $43.7 billion in sales, up 34% year over year and comfortably above the $42 billion in revenue that analysts were expecting. The results mean that Amazon’s sales growth has now accelerated for four straight quarters, a good sign for the company as sales growth in its crucial Amazon Web Services unit has stagnated. AWS, Amazon’s cloud services business and a reliable revenue-generator, contributed $4.6 billion in revenue in the most recent quarter, up 42% from the third quarter of 2017. That’s about the same rate that AWS grew at in the second quarter of this year, and slower than any other quarter in recent years. The main event of Amazon’s third quarter was, of course, the $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods that it completed in August. Amazon said Whole Foods contributed $1.3 billion in sales this past quarter, which ended Sept. 30. Whole Foods reported $3.7 billion in sales in its quarter ended July 2, its last one as an independent public company.

Amazon earnings (Shutterstock photo) Retail giant Amazon (AMZN) is set to report third quarter fiscal 2017 earnings results after the closing bell Thursday. In the three months that ended September, the Seattle-based company is expected to earn 3 cents per share on revenue of $42.05 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when the company earned 52 cents per share on $32.71 billion in revenue. For the full year, ending December, EPS is expected to be $3.63 per share, down from $4.90 per share a year ago, while full year revenue of $174.65 billion would rise 28.4% year over year. Clearly, the e-commerce giant is still projected to put up impressive growth numbers. Notably, this is even though Amazon — now valued at close to $500 billion — is almost twice the size of Wal-Mart (WMT). That said, the company did miss its second quarter earnings estimates and signaled increased capital spending, which spooked investors into selling AMZN stock. The shares took a massive haircut as a result, falling from its all-time high of $1,083 to around $936. While the shares have rebounded somewhat, the stock is still down 7% in three months, suggesting investors are anxious whether CEO Jeff Bezos — as he’s known to do — will decide if it’s time to mash the profit accelerator or continue to building out his vision, which ultimately means higher spending. As such, on Thursday, analysts will also focus on the company’s profit margins, looking for any hint into Bezos’ thinking and whether the stock deserves its consensus price target of $1163, which calls for 20% rise from current levels. Amazon continues to invest in ways to strengthen its logistics, while also expanding internationally. The company’s plans for Whole Foods acquisition will also be a hot topic. Amazon, which immediately cut prices of some selected grocery products, has wasted no time dictating food prices. The acquisition is a way for Amazon to broaden its Prime shopper base. How much of a contribution has Whole Foods made? Piper Jaffray analysts are modeling for $1.4 billion. Beyond the top and bottom line numbers and the impact of Whole Foods, the Street will want to see how the company’s AWS (Amazon Web Services) cloud platform performs, which will dictate how much of a focus should be placed on the company’s capital spending. AWS boats more than half of Fortune 500 companies on the platform to run their businesses. It’s still the clear-cut leader in cloud market share and accounts for more than half of Amazon's operating profits in 2016, up ten percentage points than 2015. At the same time, however, competing cloud platforms from Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) are gaining traction. In the second quarter, AWS revenue rose 42% year over year to $4.1 billion, showing that it is still growing impressively. To the extent AWS, which grew 55% in the year-ago quarter, can grow at 40%-plus Thursday the Street will be pleased. This is because despite the growth deceleration, AWS is still growing twice as faster the retail segment, while producing operating margins that are ten times higher. In other words, AWS carries tons of muscle. And if Amazon can flex more of it Thursday the stock should fly towards all-time highs, and in the process assuaging investor fears about any increased sending the company may wish to adopt to maintain its competitive edge.

Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) posted its third-quarter results Thursday afternoon. The company reported its earnings after the market closed, which saw AMZN shares soar on the e-commerce retailer’s impressive results. Earnings came in at 52 cents per share, which was in line with the year-ago mark. Revenue was a strong point for Amazon, coming in at $43.7 billion, ahead of the $42.19 billion that analysts were calling for, and ahead of the year-ago mark by 34%. One of the most important elements of the period was the acquisition of Whole Foods, which saw the retailer take over a segment of the grocery industry. Prime Day was important for the company as it helped retail growth to increase, especially in international markets, according to the company’s CFO. Amazon Web Services is the strongest segment of the retailer, growing 42% year-over-year and amounting to 11% of the company’s total revenue. The cloud computing unit is also growing at a fast rate for the retailer, surging to $4.6 billion in the period, ahead of the $3.2 billion from a year ago. Amazon predicts that it will rake in between $56 billion and $60.5 billion in sales during its fourth quarter, which marks a growth of between 28% and 38% for the period. The forecast is fueled by the Whole Foods acquisition, as well as a favorable foreign exchange rate. Operating income is slated to be between $300 million and $1.65 billion, compared with $1.3 billion in the year-ago quarter. AMZN shares soared 7.6% after the bell.

Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) is an interesting player in the Services space, with a focus on Catalog & Mail Order Houses. The stock has been active on the tape, currently trading at $1110.85, up from yesterday’s close by 0.90%. Given the stock’s recent action, it seemed like a good time to take a closer look at the company’s recent data.

Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) currently trades with a market capitalization of $471.33 Billion.

For AMZN, the company currently has $12.77 Billion of cash on the books, which is offset by $6.58 Billion current liabilities. You can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $7.72 Billion over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to fall in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $1.83 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 61.19% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors. Technical Analysis No analysis is ever complete without a thorough survey of a stock’s technical behavior. Looking at the stock’s movement on the chart, Amazon.com, Inc. recorded a 52-week high of $1105.58. It is now trading -5.27% off that level.

Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) gained 0.90% in yesterday’s session, going up from its prior closing price of $1 100.95 to $1 110.85, and has now recorded rally in 3 consecutive sessions. Many in the market will be closely watching whether this winning streak is sustainable or take a temporary pause for the next couple of trading sessions.

Trading activity decreased by -9.89 million shares, and in total, 6.59 M shares exchanged hands for about $7 322.31 million. It should be noted that increasing price and decreasing volume show lack of interest and this is a warning that something has fundamentally changed. Inside AMZN’s Recent Trend Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) has broken the weak rising the short-term trend up and an even stronger rising rate is indicated. For any reaction back there will now be support on the roof on the current trend broken at $1 014.52, a point that may provide a 2nd chance needed to hit a runner. The next trend top is most likely to be exhibited at $1 079.62 will be the next possible trend-top level and thereby pose a resistance level which may not be broken at the first attempt.

     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 AMZN has witnessed its long term and short term MA triggering a buy signal. Many traders watch for short-term averages to cross above long-term averages to signal the beginning of a uptrend. Upon corrections, the price will meet support from the averages between $1 011.75 and $984.44. A break down through these support points will trigger sell signals. Its pivot point low generated buy signal on Monday October 23, 2017, which calls for additional surge until the stock forms a new pivot point high. There was a decrease in volume but the price rose. This is usually not interpreted as a good sign as traders widely believe falling volume should see declining stock. Investors should be watching the price action like a hawk in the coming sessions. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) Support And Resistance Levels Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) recorded volume accumulation so there will probably be a surplus of buyers at $1 100.95. It seems to be blessed by the accumulated volume as it meets no resistance above current level and favorable trading conditions will help the stock to show strong performance in the coming days.

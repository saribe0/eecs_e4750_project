Alibaba earnings (Shutterstock photo) Chinese e-commerce and tech giant Alibaba (BABA) will report second quarter fiscal 2018 earnings results before the opening bell Thursday. With year-to-date returns approaching 110%, you would be hard-pressed to find a hotter stock on market today. Yet, despite being one of 2017’s best performers, a case can be made that BABA shares, which trade at just 26 times 2018 EPS estimates, are cheap. That valuation is almost 20 points below its historical average. At the same time, Wall Street analysts are constantly revising BABA’s profits estimates higher in order to keep up with the company’s growth. Just in the past thirty days, estimates for the just-ended quarter and full year have been revised higher by 8% and 7%, respectively. In the three months that ended September, Wall Street expects Hong Kong-based online retailer to report $1.04 per share on revenue of $7.86 billion, translating to year-over-year growth of 31.6% and 52%, respectively. For the full year, ending in March 2018, earnings are projected to rise 39% year over year to $4.91 per share, while full-year revenue of $35.63 billion would rise 49.5% year over year. As gaudy as these projections might appear, Alibaba has established a track record of crushing even the most bullish expectations. Last quarter the company reported a profit of $2.17 billion, or 82 cents per share. On an adjusted basis, when taking out one-time gains and costs, earnings were $1.17 per share per share, which beats Thomson Reuters consensus estimates of 93 cents per share. The company also posted revenue of $7.52 billion, which also topped Street forecasts $7.15 billion. The results, which includes first quarter revenue surging 56%, combined with a whopping 24-cent beat on the bottom line, sent BABA stock soaring almost 10% to then an all-time high go $167.50. Since then the stock, which has gained almost 20% in three months, has amassed several more all-time highs, currently at $184.70. But the top- and bottom-line numbers are just part of the story. On Thursday, Wall Street will want to see whether the world's largest retailer (by gross merchandise volume) can continue diversifying its business to strengthening its position beyond core commerce. Areas such as its digital payments platform, AliPay and new growth areas such as the cloud, where it has a goal of challenging both Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) will be in focus. In the first quarter, Alibaba’s cloud revenue surged 96% year over year, driven by 15% sequential rise in the number of cloud-paying customers, which now stands at over one million. The company has not only seen increases in the number of paying customers, its customers are also spending higher than usual, which drives up usage of services. Elsewhere, analysts will also want to see sustained increases in fast growing, albeit smaller segments such as digital media and entertainment revenue and innovation initiatives, which in Q1 posted revenue growth of 30% and 21%, respectively. All told, with its market cap approaching half a billion dollars, Alibaba has high expectations to live up to this quarter. But with a quality management team that is known for consistently knocking it out of the park, betting against of the strongest tech conglomerates on the market today, which has wind in its sails, can get you hurt.

With sales growth projected to top 49% next year, and average nearly that through the end of this year, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA) should be trading north of $200 by now. Lamentations about geopolitical woes and an overvalued U.S. stock market aside, Alibaba bulls are in for a treat this November. The Chinese e-commerce giant has not one, but two events that should drive the BABA stock price well north of $200 before December. The first such event occurs this Thursday morning, when Alibaba will step up to release its fiscal second-quarter earnings report. Analysts are projecting a 30% rise in earnings to $1.03 per share and a 52% spike in revenue to $7.85 billion. Those are some impressive numbers, to say the least. But projections could still be on the light side, as EarningsWhispers.com projects a whisper number of $1.10 per share. Given that Alibaba has a habit of routinely blowing out Wall Street’s expectations, a whisper number beat could be in the cards this Thursday. If a strong earnings performance wasn’t enough, Singles Day takes place on Nov 11. This regional holiday is bigger than Black Friday for the Chinese e-commerce giant. This year, Alibaba has access to a plethora of U.S. retailers and is planning a “Retail as entertainment” event as well as a “See Now, Buy Now” fashion show to kick off this online shopping extravaganza. Last year, consumers spent the equivalent of $17.79 billion on Singles Day, making it bigger than both Black Friday and Cyber Monday. And Alibaba is front and center for the event. A look at sentiment heading into November reveals a heavy bullish bias from the brokerage community. In fact, nearly all 43 analysts following BABA stock rate it a “buy” or better, with less than a handful doling out “holds.” While that leaves little room for upgrades, there is plenty of room for price target increases, as the average consensus price target of $197.23 represents a measly premium of only about 8.6% to yesterday’s close. 
Click to Enlarge Turning to BABA stock options pits, we find that speculative traders are nowhere near as bullish as the brokerage community. Currently, the November put/call open interest ratio comes in at 0.63. Yes, calls have a clear upper hand, but peak November call OI rests at the in-the-money $180 strike, with heavy call accumulations also at the $175 strike.

Published on By In the spirit of strong objective analysis, we are going to take a close look at Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. ADR (NYSE: BABA) from a technical chartist point of view today. With Biotechs Running HOT, This Little Known Stock Has An Attractive Platform For Investors. Click To Read More  In short, technical analysis assumes that all publicly available facts about a stock are already discounted by knowledgeable buyers and sellers. And it is from there that the real work begins: examining the stocks behavior on the chart. As such, we will begin with a quick check of the primary oscillators: the 14-day Relative Strength Indicator (RSI) and the 20-day fast stochastic. Both of these measures report on the degree to which a security is overbought or oversold ie, whether it has gone too far too fast in one direction or the other, and some kind of mean-reversion is called for. In each case, an indicator score of above 75 is considered overbought, while a score under 25 is considered oversold. In the case of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. ADR, the 14-day RSI stands at 62.86%, while the past month of action shows a score of 87.53% on the fast stochastic. Well, what if we now look away from mean-reversion and towards the concept of trend That comprises our next step. To do this, we will start off by examining the most common systematic technical method of determining the direction of long-term trend in a stock: moving averages. In the most basic sense, we can see that BABA has recently been exhibiting a bearing on the chart that suggests an overall bullish mode of behavior. This read comes from a look at the relative positioning of the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages: if the 50-day is trading above the 200-day, momentum is to the upside making a bull case for trend; if the 50-day is trading below the 200-day, momentum is to the downside, making a bear case for trend. In this example, that system makes a bullish case, which naturally implies a positive money flow scenario for the stock. So, we’ve spent some time looking at price as a factor. But what about volume In fact, many technicians view volume as more important than price. Volume defines the total level of participation involved in a stock. Its a coefficient of meaning that should be metaphorically multiplied times price action to equal conviction. In this case, we want to examine relative volume measures to get a feel for interest in the stock of late. Right now, this stock has been showing weak relative volume, which indicates lack of interest among those making a market for shares of the stock. Next, we will turn to key levels. We always like to start this with a look at the key Fib levels. Fib refers to Fibonacci, which is the number series that works toward a ratio limit of the Golden Ratio, often found as a key in nature as well as markets. In this case, the critical 38.2% level drawn off the 52-week high of $188.88 sits at $149.58. BABA also has additional resistance above at the stocks 200-day simple moving average, which sits at $ 136.82. While price action, trends, and volume are important, for traders, volatility may be as important as anything in defining the potential opportunity in a stock. Hence, we want to take a moment and consider this stocks overall range of movement, as well as its relative performance. BABA has moved $+6.79 over the past month or so. Over the trailing 100 days, the stock is outperforming the S&P 500 by 27.61%. This movement has come on a more volatile bearing from one day to the next relative to the broader market, according to the stocks 36-month beta. Similarly, we can see that the stocks recent action has come on a historical volatility score of 26.61%. To get that score, one has to take the standard deviation of returns for a random trading input assuming buying the stock at a given average price during the specified period. On a more basic level, one might look at the 20-day ATR as a percentage of its 20-day moving average. That measure gives us a volatility score of 2.27%. Naturally, we will continue to keep close tabs on the stock and update this picture again soon.

Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE: BABA) reports earnings for its second quarter of fiscal 2018 before the market opens on Thursday, Nov. 2. The stock has had quite the run in 2017, moving from a low of $88.08 in January to a recent all-time high of $185.12 ahead of tomorrow’s report. Earnings beats in previous quarters and updated guidance at its annual investor day in June have been some of the events that have helped to push shares higher so far this year. At its investor day in June, BABA management projected revenue growth ranging from 45% to 49% for fiscal 2018, while Wall Street consensus had been forecasting around 37% growth at the time.    Strong growth expectations in the company’s core commerce platforms and cloud computing, partially driven by increasing internet and mobile penetration in China, were two of primary factors for the updated guidance. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, BABA reported core commerce revenue increased 58% year-over-year to $6.35 billion, which the company said benefitted from growth in average spending per merchant and the number of paying merchants. Cloud computing revenue increased 96% year-over-year to $359 million during the same quarter. Management cited user growth in the cloud computing segment, which surpassed one million paying customers, as well as an improved revenue mix of higher-value added services for the 96% year-over-year increase in that division’s revenue. BABA also reiterated that market expansion remains its top priority in cloud computing.  
FIGURE 1: ALIBABA COMPANY PROFILE. Like Amazon (AMZN), Alibaba also provides cloud-computing services in addition to its e-commerce operations. The division is a smaller segment of the company that has been growing the fastest in recent quarters.  TD Ameritrade clients can plug in their own forecasts and analyze a company’s revenue drivers on the Fundamentals tab on the thinkorswim® platform. Trefis information and estimates used in Company Profile are provided by Insight Guru, a separate and unaffiliated firm. Not a recommendation. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results. BABA has indicated one of its strategic priorities is to expand both core commerce and cloud computing outside of China. To increase international awareness of the company’s platforms, BABA has started hosting conferences—essentially big marketing road shows—to educate U.S. and Canadian businesses on how to sell to Chinese consumers using its platforms as a gateway. Revenue from its international commerce retail segment increased 136% year-over-year to $389 million in the fiscal first quarter, according to the company. On the cloud computing front, BABA announced plans earlier in the year to build data centers in Malaysia, India and Indonesia to expand to new regions beyond the 14 data centers it already operates. Beyond the core commerce and cloud computing metrics, analysts also typically look at mobile monthly active users and annual active consumers. In the fiscal first quarter, BABA reported mobile monthly active users increased 24% year-over-year to 529 million, and annual active consumers for the 12-month period ending June 30 increased 7% year-over-year to 466 million. The company’s upcoming global shopping festival known as Singles’ Day on November 11 is another common focus for analysts. Last year, the event generated $17.8 billion in gross merchandise volume.  
FIGURE 2: ALIBABA YTD PERFORMANCE. So far this year, Alibaba (BABA), which is charted above, has increased a significant amount and is up 108.68% as of October 31. The year-to-date performance for the S&P 500 (SPX) is graphed as the pink line and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Comp (COMP) is the teal line. Chart source: thinkorswim® by TD Ameritrade.  Data source: Standard & Poor’s. Not a recommendation. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results. For the second quarter of fiscal 2018, BABA is expected to report adjusted earnings of $1.04 per share, up from $0.79 in the prior-year quarter, on revenue of $7.78 billion, up 51.3% year-over-year, according to third-party consensus analyst estimates. Looking back over the past eight quarters, BABA has beat revenue estimates in all of them and earnings estimates in six of them.  The stock has continued to rise in 2017, although since early August it has been bouncing up and down in a tighter range. It briefly dipped below its 50-day moving average last week, something the stock hadn’t done all year, but it has since bounced back and is trading close to an all-time high of $185.12. Around BABA’s upcoming earnings release, options traders have priced in about a 5.1% potential share price move in either direction, according to the Market Maker Move indicator on the thinkorswim® platform. In short-term trading at the November 3 expiration, calls have been active at the 180 and 190 strike prices, while puts have been active at the 170, 175 and 180 strikes. As of this morning, the implied volatility sits at the 92nd percentile. Note: Call options represent the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time. Put options represent the right, but not the obligation to sell the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time. Later today, the Federal Open Market Committee will release a statement as it wraps up its second to last meeting of the year, potentially providing some more information about the Fed’s views on the overall economy as President Trump mulls over candidates to replace Fed Chair Janet Yellen. On the earnings front, tech mega-cap Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) reports earnings after market close on Thursday, Nov. 2. And over the next two weeks, quite a few of the brick-and-mortar retailers including Macy’s Inc (NYSE: M), Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE: WMT), Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT) and Home Depot Inc (NYSE: HD) report results.

Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE: BABA) reports earnings for its second quarter of fiscal 2018 before the market opens on Thursday, Nov. 2. The stock has had quite the run in 2017, moving from a low of $88.08 in January to a recent all-time high of $185.12 ahead of tomorrow’s report. Earnings beats in previous quarters and updated guidance at its annual investor day in June have been some of the events that have helped to push shares higher so far this year. At its investor day in June, BABA management projected revenue growth ranging from 45% to 49% for fiscal 2018, while Wall Street consensus had been forecasting around 37% growth at the time.    Strong growth expectations in the company’s core commerce platforms and cloud computing, partially driven by increasing internet and mobile penetration in China, were two of primary factors for the updated guidance. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, BABA reported core commerce revenue increased 58% year-over-year to $6.35 billion, which the company said benefitted from growth in average spending per merchant and the number of paying merchants. Cloud computing revenue increased 96% year-over-year to $359 million during the same quarter. Management cited user growth in the cloud computing segment, which surpassed one million paying customers, as well as an improved revenue mix of higher-value added services for the 96% year-over-year increase in that division’s revenue. BABA also reiterated that market expansion remains its top priority in cloud computing.  
FIGURE 1: ALIBABA COMPANY PROFILE. Like Amazon (AMZN), Alibaba also provides cloud-computing services in addition to its e-commerce operations. The division is a smaller segment of the company that has been growing the fastest in recent quarters.  TD Ameritrade clients can plug in their own forecasts and analyze a company’s revenue drivers on the Fundamentals tab on the thinkorswim® platform. Trefis information and estimates used in Company Profile are provided by Insight Guru, a separate and unaffiliated firm. Not a recommendation. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results. BABA has indicated one of its strategic priorities is to expand both core commerce and cloud computing outside of China. To increase international awareness of the company’s platforms, BABA has started hosting conferences—essentially big marketing road shows—to educate U.S. and Canadian businesses on how to sell to Chinese consumers using its platforms as a gateway. Revenue from its international commerce retail segment increased 136% year-over-year to $389 million in the fiscal first quarter, according to the company. On the cloud computing front, BABA announced plans earlier in the year to build data centers in Malaysia, India and Indonesia to expand to new regions beyond the 14 data centers it already operates. Beyond the core commerce and cloud computing metrics, analysts also typically look at mobile monthly active users and annual active consumers. In the fiscal first quarter, BABA reported mobile monthly active users increased 24% year-over-year to 529 million, and annual active consumers for the 12-month period ending June 30 increased 7% year-over-year to 466 million. The company’s upcoming global shopping festival known as Singles’ Day on November 11 is another common focus for analysts. Last year, the event generated $17.8 billion in gross merchandise volume.  
FIGURE 2: ALIBABA YTD PERFORMANCE. So far this year, Alibaba (BABA), which is charted above, has increased a significant amount and is up 108.68% as of October 31. The year-to-date performance for the S&P 500 (SPX) is graphed as the pink line and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Comp (COMP) is the teal line. Chart source: thinkorswim® by TD Ameritrade.  Data source: Standard & Poor’s. Not a recommendation. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results. For the second quarter of fiscal 2018, BABA is expected to report adjusted earnings of $1.04 per share, up from $0.79 in the prior-year quarter, on revenue of $7.78 billion, up 51.3% year-over-year, according to third-party consensus analyst estimates. Looking back over the past eight quarters, BABA has beat revenue estimates in all of them and earnings estimates in six of them.  The stock has continued to rise in 2017, although since early August it has been bouncing up and down in a tighter range. It briefly dipped below its 50-day moving average last week, something the stock hadn’t done all year, but it has since bounced back and is trading close to an all-time high of $185.12. Around BABA’s upcoming earnings release, options traders have priced in about a 5.1% potential share price move in either direction, according to the Market Maker Move indicator on the thinkorswim® platform. In short-term trading at the November 3 expiration, calls have been active at the 180 and 190 strike prices, while puts have been active at the 170, 175 and 180 strikes. As of this morning, the implied volatility sits at the 92nd percentile.

Put options represent the right, but not the obligation to sell the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time. Later today, the Federal Open Market Committee will release a statement as it wraps up its second to last meeting of the year, potentially providing some more information about the Fed’s views on the overall economy as President Trump mulls over candidates to replace Fed Chair Janet Yellen.

And over the next two weeks, quite a few of the brick-and-mortar retailers including Macy’s Inc (NYSE: M), Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE: WMT), Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT) and Home Depot Inc (NYSE: HD) report results.

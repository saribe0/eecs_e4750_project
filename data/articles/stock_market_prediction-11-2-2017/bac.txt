Bank of America Corporation (BAC) is an interesting player in the Financial space, with a focus on Money Center Banks. The stock has been active on the tape, currently trading at $27.39, down from yesterday’s close by -0.76%. Given the stock’s recent action, it seemed like a good time to take a closer look at the company’s recent data. Fundamental Analysis Money managers are always interested in a company that can find the right recipe of fundamental data because it reflects something important going on underneath the surface. Bank of America Corporation (BAC) currently trades with a market capitalization of $288.36 Billion. That value represents a market adjusting for revenues that have been growing by 16.23 % on a quarterly year/year basis as of the company’s last quarterly report.

 The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For BAC, you can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $-13.11 Billion over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to fall in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $0.48 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 69.34% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors. Technical Analysis It’s important to check the technicals to get a sense of how BAC has been acting. Looking at the stock’s movement on the chart, Bank of America Corporation recorded a 52-week high of $27.98. It is now trading 0.59% off that level. The stock is trading $25.24 its 50-day moving average by -2.15%. The stock carved out a 52-week low down at $16.28. In recent action, Bank of America Corporation (BAC) has made a move of +5.92% over the past month, which has come on weak relative transaction volume. Over the trailing year, the stock is underperforming the S&P 500 by 22.64, and it’s gotten there by action that has been more volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. In terms of the mechanics underlying that movement, traders will want to note that the stock is trading on a float of 1.09% with $10.45 Billion sitting short, betting on future declines. That suggests something of the likelihood of a short squeeze in shares of BAC.

With Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) delivering an impressive quarter a few days ago, a deeper analysis shows that tailwinds are picking up for BAC stock. Bank of America struggled for quite some time after the mortgage crisis. There were $35 billion dollars paid out in settlements, which undermined the foundational improvement in the bank. However, patient investors are starting to see benefits and I think more are on the way. BAC stock put up only a 1% increase in revenues in Q3, to $21.8 billion. However, there is a flaky number that all banks report, which is called “pre-provision operating profit”, which is the profit before loan loss provisions. The problem in making QTQ and YOY comparisons, is that this number includes trading gains and losses. Those can swing wildly from quarter to quarter. If we remove the trading gains, BAC is doing exceptionally well in regard to net interest income, which was up 10% to just over $11 billion. Behind this gain was a 13bps net interest margin increase, lifting the total margin to 236bps. It’s these margins that will be the story of the future for BAC stock price. Non-interest income (NII) was where BAC struggled, with about an 8% decline. This, in turn, was offset by a 2.5% cut in expenses. The expense side of the equation will also be important going forward. In the end, BAC stock delivered $0.48 per share in earnings, close to $5.1 billion. Mind you, even net income was clocked to the tune of $500 million because Warren Buffett finally converted his preferred shares that he bought when BAC was in big trouble. Finally, with any bank, we want to see expanding deposit volume. The more deposits there are, the more money the bank can lend out, and the more profit it can generate. Indeed, in Q3, deposit volumes were up 4.4%. What’s interesting is that the loan-to-deposit ratio, which measures how much money gets lent per dollar deposited, has declined since 2014. It fell from about 80% to 70%. That means BAC stock has been consolidating deposits and being more coy in its underwriting. This takes us back to net interest margin, mentioned above. BAC appears to be very patient in regards to opening up the loan spigot. The NII increase of 10% is impressive on its own. Should there be significant and consistent economic improvement, as reflected in GDP, that should drive demand and allow BAC to go after higher quality loans.

Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is on our radar right now but there could still be some opportunities on the horizon. Now trading with a market value of 288.36B, the company has a mix of catalysts and obstacles that spring from the nature of its operations. As the day-to-day narrative ebbs and flows for this company, it is more important than ever to step back and get a bird’s eye view of the fundamental reality under the surface of this story. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) Fundamentals That Matter It’s generally a good idea to start with the most fundamental piece of the picture: the balance sheet. The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. The trend over time is important to note. In this case, the company’s debt has been growing. The company also has 2.28T in total assets, balanced by 2.01T in total liabilities, which should give you a sense of the viability of the company under any number of imagined business contexts. Bank of America Corporation (BAC) saw 1.41 billion in free cash flow last quarter, representing a quarterly net change in cash of -9.32 billion. Perhaps most importantly where cash movements are concerned, the company saw about 1.41 billion in net operating cash flow.

 Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) Revenue Growth Potential As far as key trends that demonstrate something of the future investment potential of this stock, we need to take a closer look at the top line, first and foremost. Last quarter, the company saw 14.66 billion in total revenues. That represents a quarterly year/year change in revenues of 0.16 in sequential terms, the BAC saw sales decline by 0.04. But what about the bottom line? After all, that’s what really matters in the end. Bank of America Corporation (BAC) is intriguing when broken down to its core data.  For shareholders, given the total diluted outstanding shares of 10.73 billion, this means overall earnings per share of 0.48. Note, this compares with a consensus analyst forecast of 0.47 in earnings per share for its next fiscal quarterly report. 
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

If we consider a median price to earnings ratio on the stock, that corresponds with a stock price of 12.85. However, one should always remember: the trends are more important than the forecasts. This continues to be an interesting story, and we look forward to updating it again soon on Bank of America Corporation.

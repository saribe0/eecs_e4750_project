Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) has put together a nice run of late. The GILD stock price today sits 24% higher than it did as recently as June, when the stock hit a three-year low. There is some good news here. As InvestorPlace’s Chris Lau pointed out, the acquisition of Kite Pharma and its CAR-T therapy makes some sense, and was met with analyst optimism. Also, InvestorPlace writer Luke Lango made a broader case for upside in the GILD stock price earlier this month. Both of my colleagues make good points  and Gilead stock looks cheap, trading at less than 11x forward EPS. But I’m not buying the rally in GILD stock. As a company, I like Gilead, and its efforts to battle hepatitis C and HIV are commendable. But as a stock, GILD isn’t as cheap as it looks, particularly when considering the broader pressure on the pharmaceutical and biotech industries. There’s one key problem that means GILD likely should only be bought at a huge discount. And I don’t think that discount is quite big enough at the moment. The approval of Yescarta, Kite’s flagship therapy, no doubt is good for GILD stock. CAR-T is a cancer treatment that uses modified versions of existing T-cells (a type of white blood cell) to create modified versions that will attack cancer cells. It’s a promising therapy — and potentially a lucrative one. As Barron’s pointed out, Kite will charge $373,000 — a huge number, but one that’s still more than $100,000 less than the existing therapy from Novartis AG (ADR) (NYSE:NVS). But from a profit standpoint, there are concerns. Notably, competition will be intense. James Brumley laid out the bull case for Juno Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:JUNO) back in August, citing its CAR-T potential. ZIOPHARM Oncology Inc. (NASDAQ:ZIOP) and bluebird bio Inc (NASDAQ:BLUE) are among myriad other smaller players working in the space. In addition, the market may not be that big — at least at first. Analyst Geoff Porges, as quoted by Barron’s, estimated just 5,300 potential patients in the U.S. That will expand over time, as the therapies improve and indications broaden. But investors expecting a major short-term profit boost from Kite will be disappointed.

Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD) is an interesting player in the Healthcare space, with a focus on Biotechnology. The stock has been active on the tape, currently trading at $74.96, down from yesterday’s close by -1.36%. Given the stock’s recent action, it seemed like a good time to take a closer look at the company’s recent data. Fundamental Analysis Money managers are always interested in a company that can find the right recipe of fundamental data because it reflects something important going on underneath the surface. Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD) currently trades with a market capitalization of $98.92 Billion. That value represents a market adjusting for revenues that have been falling by -13.17 % on a quarterly year/year basis as of the company’s last quarterly report. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For GILD, you can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $13.66 Billion over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to grow in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $1.71 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 75.86% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors. Technical Analysis No analysis is ever complete without a thorough survey of a stock’s technical behavior. Looking at the stock’s movement on the chart, Gilead Sciences, Inc. recorded a 52-week high of $86.27. It is now trading 11.31% off that level. The stock is trading $80.97 its 50-day moving average by 6.01%. The stock carved out a 52-week low down at $63.76. In recent action, Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD) has made a move of -9.89% over the past month, which has come on weak relative transaction volume. Over the trailing year, the stock is underperforming the S&P 500 by 22.64, and it’s gotten there by action that has been more volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. In terms of the mechanics underlying that movement, traders will want to note that the stock is trading on a float of 1.86% with $1.30 Billion sitting short, betting on future declines. That suggests something of the likelihood of a short squeeze in shares of GILD. 

https://www.stocknewsgazette.com/2017/10/31/gilead-sciences-inc-gild-daily-technical-review-outlook/

Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) fell by -1.40% in Monday’s trading session from $77.07 to $75.99 and has now fallen 8 consecutive sessions. The price has fallen in 8 of the last 10 days and is down by -4.95% over the same course of time. There was a decrease in both volume and price. This is usually interpreted as a good sign as traders widely believe falling stock should see declining volume. Traded activity experienced a fall of -11.43 million shares and in total 11.24 M shares exchanged hands for about $854.43 million. Inside GILD’s Recent Trend Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD) has broken the wide and strong rising short-term trend down. This signalize a slower rising rate, but may also be an early warning about a possible trend shift. Due to trend being broken there will now be resistance at the bottom line of the trend at $78.86. A reaction back to this level may hold a second chance to get out before further falls. Gilead Sciences, Inc. Technical Signals 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 GILD has witnessed its long term and short term MA triggering a sell signal. Many traders watch for long-term averages to cross above short-term averages to signal the beginning of a downtrend. Upon corrections, the price will meet resistance from the averages between $78.90 and $81.68. A buy signal will be generated if it crosses above any of these levels. Its pivot point high generated sell signal on Thursday October 19, 2017, which calls for additional declines until the stock forms a new pivot point low, as this could be a buying opportunity. The downbeat movement of both volume and price during the recent session is interpreted as a good sign because traders usually believe falling stock should see declining volume. Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) Support And Resistance Levels Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD) recorded volume accumulation so there will probably be a surplus of buyers at $74.69. In case of gains, the next resistance from accumulated volume will not be far away from today’s level at $77.07, $81.23 and $83.71. 
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Accumulated volume is going to prevent the price from rising further at $77.07 and this action will lead the price to take a temporary pause or stay muted for a few days. Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD) Risk Assessment The number of shares changed hands in the stock is good, indicating the interest and low risk associated with it. In the most recent session, the stock price hovered around $1.68 (2.23%) between intraday high and intraday low. Each day in the past 1 week, the average volatility remained at 3.07%. Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD) is in oversold territory based on Relative Strength Index reading (17). In some cases it takes more time for the trend to shift while the stock is being oversold and the Relative Strength Index keeps moving.

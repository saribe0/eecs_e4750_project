JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) fell by -0.79% in Tuesday’s trading session from $101.41 to $100.61 and has now fallen 3 consecutive sessions.. The stock price went upward in 7 of the last 10 days and has generated 3.06% during the last two weeks. There was a decrease in both volume and price. This is usually interpreted as a good sign as traders widely believe falling stock should see declining volume. Traded activity experienced a fall of -0.21 million shares and in total 8.63 M shares exchanged hands for about $868.19 million. Inside JPM’s Recent Trend JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) lies in the upper part of a strong rising trend in the short term, and this will normally pose a very good selling opportunity for the short-term trader as reaction back towards the lower part of the trend can be expected. A break-up at the top trend line at $102.06 will firstly indicate a stronger raising rate. Short-term traders are predicted to see a rally of 10.1% over the course of a quarter and, with 90% chance the price will be floating in the range of $103.31 and $112.37 in this timeframe. JPMorgan Chase & Co. Technical Signals 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 JPM has witnessed its short term MA triggering a sell signal. Meanwhile, however, the long-term average has generated a buy signal. When the short-run moving average rises above its longer-term trend, a buy signal is created. This is because a short-run moving average that crosses its long-run moving average counterpart is seen as the initiation of an upward trend. On additional rally, the share price will meet short term resistance at around $100.97. On a drop, the stock is likely to find some support over the long run, which begins at $96.68. A buy signal will be generated if it crosses above the short term moving average. Meanwhile, however, a price crossing below the long term moving average will generate a sell signal. Some other technical concerns emerged as well, putting in risk the future growth of the stock in the next couple of days. Its pivot point high generated sell signal on Friday October 27, 2017, which calls for additional declines until the stock forms a new pivot point low, as this could be a buying opportunity. The downbeat movement of both volume and price during the recent session is interpreted as a good sign because traders usually believe falling stock should see declining volume. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) Support And Resistance Levels JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) recorded volume accumulation so there will probably be a surplus of buyers at $96.84. In case of gains, the next resistance from accumulated volume will not be far away from today’s level at $100.92, $101.02 and $101.74. 
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Accumulated volume is going to prevent the price from rising further at $100.92 and this action will lead the price to take a temporary pause or stay muted for a few days. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) Risk Assessment The number of shares changed hands in the stock is good, indicating the interest and low risk associated with it. In the most recent session, the stock price hovered around $1.13 (1.12%) between intraday high and intraday low. Each day in the past 1 week, the average volatility remained at 1.14%.

JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) has been a major beneficiary of the stock market rally following the 2016 election. Since this time last year, shares of the New York City-based bank are up 44%. That's more than twice the S&P 500. It also comes in ahead of other large-cap banks, with the KBW Bank Index returning 38% over the same stretch. Given this performance, it's reasonable for investors to ask this question: Is JPMorgan Chase's stock cheap or expensive? Image source: Getty Images. A common way to measure a bank stock's valuation is to use the price-to-book value ratio, which is calculated by dividing a bank's share price by its book value per share. This tells you how much investors think a bank is worth relative to how much the bank purports to be worth on its balance sheet. A bank with a ratio above 1.0 is said to trade for a premium to book value. The implication is that investors think the bank will create value beyond its current net worth. Conversely, a bank that trades for less than book value per share is said to trade at a discount to book value. This implies that investors expect the bank's value to erode -- perhaps as a result of excess unrecognized loan losses. Data source: YCharts.com. Chart by author. In the case of JPMorgan Chase, its stock trades for 1.49 times its book value per share. That equates to a 49% premium to book value. Despite this, compared to other bank stocks, JPMorgan Chase stock doesn't come across as expensive. The median valuation on the KBW Bank Index is 1.41 times book value, or only eight basis points less than JPMorgan Chase. Data source: YCharts.com. Chart by author. A second way to measure a bank's valuation is to use the price-to-earnings ratio, or P/E ratio. You calculate this by dividing a bank's share price by its earnings per share. The P/E ratio reflects how much it costs an investor to buy $1 worth of a company's earnings. If the P/E ratio is 20, then it costs $20. If the ratio is 9, it costs $9. There is no general industry benchmark in terms of what constitutes a high or low P/E ratio for a bank stock. That said, one can compare a bank stock's P/E ratio to stocks that are both within the bank industry and outside of it; this is a key benefit of the P/E ratio over the price-to-book value ratio. *The median was used for the KBW Bank Index and the S&P 500. Data source: YCharts.com, The Wall Street Journal. Chart by author. In JPMorgan Chase's case, its stock trades for 14.2 times its earnings over the trailing 12 months. That compares to a median P/E ratio on the S&P 500, an index of large-cap stocks, of 23.2. The median on the KBW Bank Index is 16.8. By this measure, then, JPMorgan Chase's stock seems cheap, at least on a relative basis. While bank stocks like JPMorgan Chase may not have rich valuations right now, that doesn't mean they can't drop by a large margin; they can. One could make the argument, in fact, that stocks more broadly are in jeopardy of a correction right now, given the multiyear bull market in equities since the financial crisis. But holding all else equal, if you're going to buy a bank stock in this environment, it doesn't hurt to buy one like JPMorgan Chase, which has a reputation for being superbly managed and which trades at a reasonable valuation.

Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) shares are up more than 23.88% this year and recently decreased -0.84% or -$0.62 to settle at $73.62. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), on the other hand, is up 17.07% year to date as of 10/25/2017. It currently trades at $101.02 and has returned 3.09% during the past week. Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) are the two most active stocks in the Money Center Banks industry based on today’s trading volumes. We will compare the two companies based on the strength of various metrics, including growth, profitability, risk, return, and valuation to determine if one is a better investment than the other. Growth The ability to grow earnings at a compound rate over time is a crucial determinant of investment value. Analysts expect C to grow earnings at a 10.78% annual rate over the next 5 years. Comparatively, JPM is expected to grow at a 9.43% annual rate. All else equal, C’s higher growth rate would imply a greater potential for capital appreciation. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Profitability and Returns A high growth rate isn’t necessarily valuable to investors. In fact, companies that overinvest in low return projects just to achieve a high growth rate can actually destroy shareholder value. Profitability and returns are a measure of the quality of a company’s business and its growth opportunities. We’ll use EBITDA margin and Return on Investment (ROI) to measure this., compared to an EBITDA margin of 56.8% for JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM). C’s ROI is 8.20% while JPM has a ROI of 5.90%. The interpretation is that C’s business generates a higher return on investment than JPM’s. Cash Flow  
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Earnings don’t always accurately reflect the amount of cash that a company brings in. On a percent-of-sales basis, C’s free cash flow was 0% while JPM converted 0% of its revenues into cash flow. This means that, for a given level of sales, C is able to generate more free cash flow for investors. Financial Risk C’s debt-to-equity ratio is 0.97 versus a D/E of 1.26 for JPM. JPM is therefore the more solvent of the two companies, and has lower financial risk. Valuation C trades at a forward P/E of 12.41, a P/B of 0.96, and a P/S of 3.32, compared to a forward P/E of 13.28, a P/B of 1.54, and a P/S of 5.80 for JPM. C is the cheaper of the two stocks on an earnings, book value and sales basis. Given that earnings are what matter most to investors, analysts tend to place a greater weight on the P/E. Analyst Price Targets and Opinions Just because a stock is cheaper doesn’t mean there’s more value to be had. In order to assess value we need to compare the current price to where it’s likely to trade in the future. C is currently priced at a -3.2% to its one-year price target of 76.05. Comparatively, JPM is 1.45% relative to its price target of 99.58. This suggests that C is the better investment over the next year. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 2.30 for C and 2.50 for JPM, which implies that analysts are more bullish on the outlook for JPM. Risk and Volatility Analyst use beta to measure a stock’s volatility relative to the overall market. Stocks with a beta above 1 tend to have bigger swings in price than the market as a whole, the opposite being the case for stocks with a beta below 1. C has a beta of 1.56 and JPM’s beta is 1.20. JPM’s shares are therefore the less volatile of the two stocks. Insider Activity and Investor Sentiment The analysis of insider buying and selling trends can be extended to the aggregate level. Short interest, which represents the percentage of a stock’s tradable shares currently being shorted, captures what the market as a whole feels about a stock. C has a short ratio of 1.72 compared to a short interest of 2.47 for JPM. This implies that the market is currently less bearish on the outlook for C. Summary Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) beats JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) on a total of 10 of the 14 factors compared between the two stocks. C is growing fastly, generates a higher return on investment, higher liquidity and has lower financial risk. In terms of valuation, C is the cheaper of the two stocks on an earnings, book value and sales basis, C is more undervalued relative to its price target. Finally, C has better sentiment signals based on short interest.

http://www.businessinsider.com/jpmorgan-says-the-next-market-correction-will-be-painful-2017-10

 JPMorgan Chase's giant corporate and investment bank â the undisputed leader on Wall Street â is beefing up risk management and hewing conservative ahead of what it anticipates will be a painful market correction in the near future. The amount of complacency in the markets is triggering red flags for Daniel Pinto, the head of JPMorgan Chase's investment bank, who recently met with research analysts from Keefe, Bruyette, and Woods. Volatility has been hovering near record lows, with markets remaining abnormally calm even in the face of turbulent geopolitical events, such as the US's escalated tensions with North Korea. One significant risk that could turn all that upside down, according to Pinto, is inflation. He told KBW that if inflation exceeds projections by investors and central bankers, that could disrupt the long bull market we've enjoyed and put a halt to the economic cycle, sending shocks through emerging markets as well. "Management is concerned about the amount of complacency in the markets and because of that the next market correction will be painful," KBW analysts wrote in a research note. KBW analysts don't think a correction is coming soon, but JPMorgan is nonetheless taking proactive measures to pare back risk, such as rejecting leveraged lending deals, even though they pass muster with guidelines from the OCC. If an ugly market correction does rear its head, KBW says JPMorgan is poised to benefit, as it will have more capacity to deploy capital than its peers and could capture more market share.

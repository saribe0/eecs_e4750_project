Bargain hunters are wise to pay careful attention to insider buying, because although there are many various reasons for an insider to sell a stock, presumably the only reason they would use their hard-earned dollars to make a purchase, is that they expect to make money. Today we look at two noteworthy recent insider buys.      On Wednesday, Lockheed Martin ( LMT  )'s Director, Daniel F. Akerson, made a $780,059 buy of LMT, purchasing 2,500 shares at a cost of $312.02 each. Investors are able to buy LMT at a price even lower than Akerson did, with shares changing hands as low as $307.82 at last check today -- that's 1.3% under Akerson's purchase price. Lockheed Martin is trading up about 0.6% on the day Monday. This buy marks the first one filed by Akerson in the past twelve months.  makeArticleAd();    And at Mid-America Apartment Communities ( MAA  ), there was insider buying on Friday, by Director William Reid Sanders who bought 7,000 shares for a cost of $100.11 each, for a trade totaling $700,798. Mid-America Apartment Communities is trading up about 0.2% on the day Monday. Sanders was up about 1.5% on the buy at the high point of today's trading session, with MAA trading as high as $101.65 in trading on Monday.

Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) and United Technologies Corporation (NYSE:UTX) are both Industrial Goods companies that recently hit new highs. The recent price action of these companies has left many investors wondering what actions to take. To determine if one is a better investment than the other, we will compare the two names across various metrics, including growth, profitability, risk, return, dividends, and valuation. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) operates in the Aerospace/Defense Products & Services segment of the Industrial Goods sector. The company has grown sales at a 0.30% annual rate over the past five years, putting it in the low growth category. LMT has a net profit margin of 7.30% and is more profitable than the average company in the Aerospace/Defense Products & Services industry. In terms of efficiency, LMT has an asset turnover ratio of 0.97. This figure represents the amount of revenue a company generates per dollar of assets. LMT’s financial leverage ratio is 21.54, which indicates that the company’s asset base is primarily funded by debt. Company’s return on equity, which is really just the product of the company’s profit margin, asset turnover, and financial leverage ratios, is 228.50%, which is better than the Aerospace/Defense Products & Services industry average ROE. Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT) pays out an annual dividend of 8.00 per share. At the current valuation, this equates to a dividend yield of 2.60%. The company has a payout ratio of 58.00%. LMT’s current dividend therefore should be sustainable. Stock’s free cash flow yield, which represents the amount of cash available to investors before dividends, expressed as a percentage of the stock price, is 1.13. All else equal, companies with higher FCF yields are viewed as cheaper. Company trades at a P/E ratio of 24.97, and is more expensive than the average stock in the Aerospace/Defense Products & Services industry. The average investment recommendation for LMT, taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts, is 2.20, or a buy. Over the past three months, Lockheed Martin Corporation insiders have been net buyers, dumping a net of -56,677 shares. This implies that insiders have been feeling relatively bearish about the outlook for LMT. Insider activity and sentiment signals are important to monitor because they can shed light on how “risky” a stock is perceived to be at it’s current valuation. Knowing this, it makes sense to look at beta, a measure of market risk. LMT has a beta of 0.57 and therefore an below average level of market volatility.

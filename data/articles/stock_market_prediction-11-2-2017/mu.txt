The world of autonomous driving is set to become a major industry, with the potential to grow massively over the next few decades. Investors have taken notice and are currently on the lookout for stocks that have exposure to the self-driving car push. Picking stocks in this industry might seem to be growth plays on their face. But not every company with ties to autonomous vehicles are set to pop. This is where picking a stock with real growth fundamentals can be fun and potentially rewarding, as it presents the possibility for massive returns. One stock that fits this mold for outside growth, based on real business segment fundamentals, is Micron Technology, Inc. MU. As a semiconductor giant, Micron markets its memory and data storage solutions to computer manufacturing firms, consumer electronics companies, and telecommunications powers. Micron has also invested heavily in vehicle safety technology that could prove to be foundational for a driverless car future. The company’s vehicle-focused semiconductor technology currently helps reduce human driving errors. This includes gesture control interfaces that help detect drowsy and distracted drivers and vehicle sensors that create more advanced computer “vision.” Along with these technologies, Micron’s artificial intelligence already helps vehicles detect and alert drivers to objects, pedestrians, and other hazards that might be in the road. Fundamentals  Micron is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that rocks an “A” grade for Growth. On top of that, Micron’s sports an overall VGM grade of an “A.” Shares of Micron have already surged over 133% during the last 52 weeks. Micron has seen its stock price climb nearly 47% in the last 12 weeks alone. It seems that this substantial stock price movement was based on Micron’s ability to grow both it top and bottom lines. At the end of September, Micron reported fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 results that climbed year-over-year. The company’s Q4 revenues skyrocketed 91%, while its full-year sales soared 64% to hit $20.32 billion. "Micron delivered exceptional fourth quarter and fiscal year results, reflecting solid execution and robust demand for our memory and storage solutions," Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said in a statement.  "We expect healthy industry fundamentals to continue into 2018, supported by increasingly diverse end markets and applications.” Investors who didn’t benefit from Micron’s substantial gains so far this year might be glad to know that the semiconductor company’s growth metrics are set to keep on climbing. Micron revenues are expected to jump nearly 60% in its current quarter, based on our current consensus estimates. The company seems set to keep on cruising as its full-year 2018 revenues are projected to climb almost 20% to hit an upward estimate of $24.20 billion. Micron Technology, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Micron Technology, Inc. Quote Micron has failed to top earnings estimates just once in the last three years, including posting beats in the last nine quarters. Within the last 60 days, Micron has earned four upward earnings estimate revisions for its current quarter. The semiconductor company also received four upward revisions, along with no downward changes, for its upcoming year. Micron’s earnings are projected to skyrocket over 574% in its current quarter. For its full fiscal year 2018, the company’s earnings are set to surge over 50% to touch as high as $7.76 per share. Bottom Line Based on Micron’s major 2017 success, its future growth projections, and its current Zacks Rank, it seems like a stock that growth investors should consider. When investors add these growth metrics and its Zacks Rank on top of the simple fact that Micron makes products that are becoming vitally important and necessary in the age of connected-products, this semiconductor memory powerhouse becomes even more eye-catching.

Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) is an interesting player in the Technology space, with a focus on Semiconductor- Memory Chips. The stock has been active on the tape, currently trading at $44.31, up from yesterday’s close by 6.39%. Given the stock’s recent action, it seemed like a good time to take a closer look at the company’s recent data. Fundamental Analysis Money managers are always interested in a company that can find the right recipe of fundamental data because it reflects something important going on underneath the surface. Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) currently trades with a market capitalization of $50.16 Billion. That value represents a market adjusting for revenues that have been growing by 90.80 % on a quarterly year/year basis as of the company’s last quarterly report. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For MU, the company currently has $4.63 Billion of cash on the books, which is offset by $1.26 Billion current liabilities. You can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $3.43 Billion over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to fall in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $2.17 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 83.39% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors. Technical Analysis Sometimes, we can understand most about a stock by simply looking at how it has been trading. Looking at the stock’s movement on the chart, Micron Technology, Inc. recorded a 52-week high of $42.19. It is now trading -2.12% off that level. The stock is trading $36.93 its 50-day moving average by -7.38%. The stock carved out a 52-week low down at $16.45. In recent action, Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) has made a move of +9.76% over the past month, which has come on Strong relative transaction volume. Over the trailing year, the stock is underperforming the S&P 500 by 22.64, and it’s gotten there by action that has been more volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. In terms of the mechanics underlying that movement, traders will want to note that the stock is trading on a float of 5.03% with $1.09 Billion sitting short, betting on future declines. That suggests something of the likelihood of a short squeeze in shares of MU.

Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) has taken advantage of the 90% year-to-date run-up in the MU stock price to issue another $1.2 billion in common shares. Micron announced the equity deal in early October and upsized by $200 million. The timing could not be better given the buoyancy of the overall market and unfailing optimism toward tech stocks. So, how should shareholders of MU stock view this deal? On one hand, the net effect of such a transaction means dilution for existing shareholders. But on the other hand, the newly raised funds will be used to shore up Micron’s balance sheet, which has been burdened by the debt. Per the announcement, MU intends to use about a third of the net proceeds of the offering “to redeem approximately $438 million in aggregate principal amount of its 7.500% Senior Secured Notes due 2023 and pay accrued and unpaid interest thereon.” The remaining two thirds of net proceeds will also be put toward retiring debt instruments, though no specifics were provided. And then at the very end, there’s the obligatory catchall bucket of general corporate purposes. I understand the importance from a financial standpoint of debt coverage and systemic reduction to de-risk the balance sheet. But given the strong fourth quarter and full-year performance, I would have expected a portion of funds raised to go toward business development and innovation. After all, MU considers itself one of the foremost semiconductor companies, especially as it applies to memory tech. And these are areas where competitors are always neck and neck barring tech breakthroughs. So even if a minority of the offering would be put toward this crucial area, I would be more comfortable taking the dilution, if I were a shareholder. In all fairness, $1.2 billion is just 2.5% of Micron’s $48-billion market cap. But knowing the importance of capital allocation in a company’s future and survival when times are not necessarily as buoyant, I have reason to question management’s judgment. Ultimately, is this the savviest use of proceeds? Bankers are always there to advise on market conditions and timing of an offering, whether it’s debt or equity, but it’s up to the C-suite to decide how best to use the money in building the best business possible. I’m not convinced. Let’s then give some context in light of the full-year data. The business is clearly growing by leaps and bounds. For the fourth quarter, revenues jumped 91% year-over-year to $6.4 billion, and a net income of $2.4 billion means $1.99 per diluted share in earnings. For the full year, MU stock generated revenues of over $20 billion, representing a 64% increase YOY.

Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) stock flux has recently been causing stir among the investment community. Many experts agree that the truth about a stock is best reflected in the way it moves on the chart. For this stock, the chart has a lot to say about future performance. How has the stock performed recently? Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) in the last month has increased +9.76%. Shares are now up over the past year, outperforming the broad market by -100% and outperformed a peer group of similar companies by 304%. After the latest session, which saw the stock close at a price of $44.31, MU sits below its 52-week high. Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) has been trading in a bullish manner, based on the relative positions of the stock’s 20 and 200 day moving averages. Momentum indicators 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that MU may be headed in the future. If we want to get a sense of MU’s future performance, we have to look at the speed and size of these price movements. Using what are known as momentum indicators, we can use the stock’s price momentum to get a sense of whether the stock is in the midst of, or nearing the end of, a current trend. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for MU is 71.02%, which suggests that the stock may be primed for a trend reversal or a corrective pullback in price. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 79.95%, tells a similar story, and suggests that MU currently trades in overbought territory. What do the trading volumes reveal? Volume patterns are useful for gauging the level of conviction behind price changes, and can be used to make predictions about future price movements. A sudden increase in a stock’s activity can be a sign that investors are trading in anticipation of a catalyst, or that investors feel very strongly in one way or the other about the future direction of a stock. Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) average trading volume of 37,624,414 during the past month is 28.23% above its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been more active than usual in the stock in recent times. What do the analysts think? MU is currently undervalued by -13.36% relative to the average 1-year price target of $51.14 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 1.80, which implies that analysts are generally bullish in their outlook for MU over the next year. How risky is the stock?  When predicting the future performance for a stock, it’s also important to take into account risk. To do this, analysts often use a stock’s beta, which measures the stock’s volatility relative to the overall market. Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) has a beta of 1.75, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are more extreme than the market as a whole. MU therefore has a above average level of market risk. During the past couple of weeks, MU average daily volatility was 36.32%, which is 0.86 percentage points lower than the average volatility over the past 100 days.

What Historical Figures Say About Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: MU)? Before trading, trader, investor or shareholder must have an eye on stock’s historical performance. Analysts review historical return data when trying to predict future returns or to estimate how a security might react to a particular situation, such as a drop in consumer demand. Historical returns can also be useful when estimating where future points of data may fall in terms of standard deviations. Analyzing historical data can give some perception of how a security or market has reacted to various different variables, from regular economic cycles to sudden world events. Shareholders looking to interpret historical returns should keep one caveat in mind: you can’t assume that the future will be like the past. The older the historical return data is, the more likely it is to be less useful when predicting future returns.

By Skyler Rossi Oct. 31, 2017 The MU Sustainability Office is preparing its Sustainability Tracking, Assessment & Rating System report for 2018. In this report, the office will report MU data in order to receive a sustainability score.  According to Srinivasan Raghavan, the Sustainability Office manager, sustainability is the equilibrium of the environment, society and economics.  STARS tracks and rates participating universities’ progress toward sustainability in academics, engagement, operations, planning and administration and innovation. The overall numeric scores given to each school are then translated into awards of reporter, bronze, silver, gold or platinum. Currently, MU has a score of 65.93/100, which is equivalent to a gold standing. This was reported in 2015. “We have subscribed to STARS because we feel there is substantial student interest in sustainability,” Raghavan said. “One can only manage what one measures. We feel that if we can benchmark are our sustainability metrics we can make progress. Making progress in STARS helps us in responsible stewardship of our resources which is aligned with the mission of the University of Missouri.” The MU Sustainability Office is taking several small steps in each category to raise MU’s overall score. But with a lot to get done and not enough people to do it all, it’s been tricky. “STARS has over 60 categories,” Raghavan said. “We are a two-person office at this point.  Despite being short staffed we are making gradual progress by prioritizing areas of improvement.” Currently the office is trying to increase sustainability content within the curriculum, improve outreach, build more efficient buildings and improve recycling programs.
 “We’re making what we call gradual progress on all of these things, so we’re looking at all of them and seeing where we can improve,” Raghavan said.  Over the last several months, Raghavan has been meeting and working with several offices on campus to raise awareness and integrate sustainability into MU. These organizations include campus facilities, academic affairs, faculty and even the city of Columbia. The MU STARS 2015 report showed MU needed the most improvement in curriculum, research, buildings and energy.  The report specifically emphasized the importance of increasing sustainability programs through the curriculum.  “We were unable to claim more than 15 points in Academics, and this will take a considerable amount of time to remedy,” the 2015 report noted. “We are certain that we can improve this score by capturing all of these relevant classes, programs and other sustainable practices by implementing a central reporting system.”
 While the MU office is still trying to incorporate sustainability measures in the MU curriculum, the energy section is bound to score higher. This year, MU was named the winner of the IDEA System of the Year Award, which recognizes a school each year that has excelled at energy conservation. “Energy management at Mizzou has made great progress in spite of budget cuts,” Raghavan said. “For on-site green power generation we are among the top universities in the country.” With the help from students, faculty and staff, Raghavan and the office of sustainability hope to raise the STARS score for MU.

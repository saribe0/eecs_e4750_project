Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) continues its red-hot performance. NVDA stock is one of the biggest winners on the Nasdaq for 2017. Shares are up 171% over the past year, and 83% 2017 year-to-date alone. Anyone skeptical of NVDA stock, including this author on occasion, has looked rather foolish. However, stock price isn’t always tied to business performance. In the case of NVDA stock, investors have bid it up far in excess of any reasonable valuation given the current balance of risk and reward. For NVDA stock to continue producing sizzling returns, just about everything has to go right for the company. The phrase “priced for perfection” was invented for situations like the one we see with Nvidia today. The story with NVDA stock starts at its frenetic earnings growth in recent quarters. Bulls can point to NVDA earnings with pride, it’s been one of the best stories of the year so far. The company has grown earnings by a rather astounding 137% over the past year. For the first half of 2017, compared to 2016, revenue climbed 53%, free cash flow generation by 17%, and net income by 125%. Those are amazing numbers, though net income and earnings are clearly running ahead of actual sales and cash flow, powered by improving margins and mix. All five of Nvidia’s product categories showed year-over-year growth. Only professional visualization came in under 10% growth; the other four segments all grew by at least 20%. Assuming full-year 2017 estimates are achieved, auto revenues will be up almost 5x since 2014, data center up 4x, and gaming up almost 3x. That’s some pretty heady stuff. Unfortunately, Nvidia’s growth rate is set for a serious slowdown. Analyst consensus has earnings rising from 3.49 over the past 12 months to just 4.02 next year. The company is heading for less than 20% growth next year, and analysts peg the five-year compounded growth rate going forward at just 13%. That’d put earnings in 2022 around seven bucks a share, which is nowhere near enough to justify a $200 stock price today. Sure, you can say, analysts are probably sandbagging. Nvidia tends to beat guidance when reporting quarterly results. But even assuming they beat guidance comfortably, it’s still hard to justify anything close to the current price. Given the relatively slow rate of EPS growth for the current year, the P/E ratio will barely budge. NVDA stock is at 56x PE now and is expected to fall to just 49x in 2018. Why is earnings growth slowing down so dramatically? Here’s some real NVDA news that many folks tend to gloss over. It’s worth remembering that Nvidia generates close to 70% of its revenues from gaming and professional visualization. The gaming division has benefited from the launch of a bunch of new cards. That pulled forward demand, but don’t expect that sales momentum to continue let alone accelerate. And Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) will almost certainly hit back with new graphics cards launches of their own to try to take back share from Nvidia. Nvidia has also profited from card sales due to the boom in Bitcoin, Ethereum and other such cryptocurrencies. However, logic dictates these markets will slow down sooner or later. Already, as part of AMD’s earnings miss recently, they conceded that mining card demand is “leveling off.” That as cryptocoins continue to soar. What happens to this source of demand once Bitcoin prices stall out, let alone correct sharply?

NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) is an interesting player in the Technology space, with a focus on Semiconductor – Specialized. The stock has been active on the tape, currently trading at $206.81, up from yesterday’s close by 1.46%. Given the stock’s recent action, it seemed like a good time to take a closer look at the company’s recent data. Fundamental Analysis Money managers are always interested in a company that can find the right recipe of fundamental data because it reflects something important going on underneath the surface. NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) currently trades with a market capitalization of $120.29 Billion. That value represents a market adjusting for revenues that have been growing by 56.16 % on a quarterly year/year basis as of the company’s last quarterly report. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For NVDA, the company currently has $1.99 Billion of cash on the books, which is offset by $89 Million current liabilities. You can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $1.97 Billion over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to grow in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $0.94 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 66.37% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors. Technical Analysis We’ve taken a serious look at this stock from a fundamental perspective, but the tale of the tape may offer more hints about what lies under the surface. Looking at the stock’s movement on the chart, NVIDIA Corporation recorded a 52-week high of $206.09. It is now trading -0.72% off that level. The stock is trading $180.88 its 50-day moving average by -25.93%. The stock carved out a 52-week low down at $66.57. In recent action, NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) has made a move of +15.30% over the past month, which has come on weak relative transaction volume. Over the trailing year, the stock is underperforming the S&P 500 by 22.64, and it’s gotten there by action that has been more volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. In terms of the mechanics underlying that movement, traders will want to note that the stock is trading on a float of 2.56% with $573.18 Million sitting short, betting on future declines. That suggests something of the likelihood of a short squeeze in shares of NVDA.

The recent development in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock have made investors to juggle around with their spending. Many analysts use price trends and patterns to predict future performance, and we can glean some important insights about NVDA by examining the chart. How has the stock performed recently? NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the last month has increased +15.30%. Shares are now up over the past year, outperforming the broad market by -100% and outperformed a peer group of similar companies by 314%. After the latest session, which saw the stock close at a price of $206.81, NVDA sits below its 52-week high. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been trading in a bullish manner, based on the relative positions of the stock’s 20 and 200 day moving averages. Momentum indicators 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that NVDA may be headed in the future. If we want to get a sense of NVDA’s future performance, we have to look at the speed and size of these price movements. Using what are known as momentum indicators, we can use the stock’s price momentum to get a sense of whether the stock is in the midst of, or nearing the end of, a current trend. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for NVDA is 72.04%, which suggests that the stock may be primed for a trend reversal or a corrective pullback in price. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 96.15%, tells a similar story, and suggests that NVDA currently trades in overbought territory. What do the trading volumes reveal? Analysts use volume trends to assess the level of conviction behind a stock’s price changes. When volumes suddenly increase above normal levels, it can be a sign that investors feel very strongly in one way or the other about the future direction of a stock, or may even have access to inside information. NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) average trading volume of 13,160,800 during the past month is 25.71% below its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been less active than usual in the stock in recent times. What do the analysts think? NVDA is currently overvalued by 20.4% relative to the average 1-year price target of $171.77 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 2.40, which implies that analysts are generally neutral in their outlook for NVDA over the next year. How risky is the stock?  In order to put NVDA’s recent price performance into context, we need to get a sense of how the stock moves in relation to the overall market. Beta, which measures a stock’s price volatility relative to the market, provides the cleanest measure of systematic risk for a stock. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has a beta of 1.18, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are more extreme than the market as a whole. NVDA therefore has a above average level of market risk. During the past couple of weeks, NVDA average daily volatility was 20.21%, which is 14.38 percentage points lower than the average volatility over the past 100 days.

https://www.stocknewsgazette.com/2017/10/31/nvidia-corporation-nvda-signals-from-technical-perspective/

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) gained 0.98% in yesterday’s session, going up from its prior closing price of $201.86 to $203.84, and has now recorded rally in 4 consecutive sessions. Many in the market will be closely watching whether this winning streak is sustainable or take a temporary pause for the next couple of trading sessions. The price has been moving in both directions for this period, and there has been a 2.99% gain over 10-day period. Trading activity decreased by -1.67 million shares, and in total, 12.58 M shares exchanged hands for about $2 563.73 million. It should be noted that increasing price and decreasing volume show lack of interest and this is a warning that something has fundamentally changed. Inside NVDA’s Recent Trend NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) lies in the upper part of a wide and strong rising trend in the short term, and this will normally pose a very good selling opportunity for the short-term trader as reaction back towards the lower part of the trend can be expected. A break-up at the top trend line at $208.16 will firstly indicate a stronger raising rate. Short-term traders are predicted to see a rally of 22.94% over the course of a quarter and, with 90% chance the price will be floating in the range of $228.10 and $255.91 in this timeframe. NVIDIA Corporation Technical Signals 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 NVDA has witnessed its long term and short term MA triggering a buy signal. Many traders watch for short-term averages to cross above long-term averages to signal the beginning of a uptrend. Upon corrections, the price will meet support from the averages between $198.18 and $186.10. A break down through these support points will trigger sell signals. Its pivot point low generated buy signal on Wednesday October 25, 2017, which calls for additional surge until the stock forms a new pivot point high. There was a decrease in volume but the price rose. This is usually not interpreted as a good sign as traders widely believe falling volume should see declining stock. Investors should be watching the price action like a hawk in the coming sessions. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Support And Resistance Levels In case of pullback, the next support the price will capture from accumulated volume will not be far away from current price at $187.55 and $180.11. It seems to be blessed by the accumulated volume as it meets no resistance above current level and favorable trading conditions will help the stock to show strong performance in the coming days. 
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 It is important to note, however, that the stock needs to make its way through natural risk while testing a key support level. Once this support is broken, another support level will be to be established at a lower level. Turning back to this stock, NVIDIA Corporation approaches the first support point just current price at $187.55. In case of a break, the next support we will see from accumulated volume is going to be at $180.11 and $155.96. NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Risk Assessment A volatility based measure Bollinger Bands suggests this stock poses high risk. In the most recent session, the stock price hovered around $4.87 between high and low, or 2.42%. The average volatility for the past week stood at 2.38%.

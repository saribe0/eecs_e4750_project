 Despite the loss of four starters, the UAA women's basketball team is receiving some preseason love nationally and in the Great Northwest Athletic Conference.  The Seawolves, 30-2 last season, enter the season ranked No. 4 nationally in NCAA Division II and are the preseason favorites to win their fourth straight GNAC title.  UAA opens the season this week with a game against Johnson & Wales, a member of the United States Collegiate Athletic Association, on Thursday in Charlotte, North Carolina, and a Sunday game against NCAA Division I powerhouse Duke in Durham, North Carolina.  The Blue Devils enter the season ranked No. 12 in NCAA Division I.  "We're really excited just to get out on the road and stop competing against each other and play against someone in a different colored uniform," UAA coach Ryan McCarthy said. "I think everybody is just excited to see how we look as a team."  UAA's lone returning starter is junior guard Tara Thompson, who averaged 8.9 points per game and shot 43.6 percent from 3-point land last season.  The new-look men's basketball squad Tuesday was picked to finish fourth in the GNAC this season.  The Seawolves, who feature 12 newcomers, head to California this week to play Division I UC Irvine in a Friday exhibition in Irvine before opening the regular season against NAIA Antelope Valley on Saturday in Lancaster.  "We'll have a bunch of newcomers, we'll throw them into the fire and see where we come out," UAA coach Rusty Osborne said at a press conference.  Ahead of UAA in the preseason poll are No. 1 Western Washington, No. 2 Western Oregon and No. 3 Central Washington.  The Seawolves are coming off back-to-back 21-win seasons, but they have five new starters this season.  UAA rebuilt its roster with the addition of four Division I transfers, including preseason conference picks Jacob Lampkin and D.J. Ursery from the University of the Pacific.  The UAA volleyball team is on a roll and so is junior outside hitter Chrisalyn Johnson. The same week the Seawolves entered the first West Region rankings at No. 8, the 5-foot-8 Dimond grad was named the American Volleyball Coaches Association Player of the Week and the GNAC Offensive Player of the Week.  Johnson powered the Seawolves (16-7, 11-3 GNAC) over two nationally ranked opponents last week with 40 kills on .243 hitting in five-set wins over No. 25 Central Washington and No. 10 Northwest Nazarene.  "It's the second round of GNAC (matches) so we were happy avenge a couple losses here at home," UAA coach Chris Green said. "We had huge crowds and I think that helped energize our team."  With three weeks to go in the regular season, UAA hits the road for the last time this week to face GNAC-leading Western Washington (19-3, 13-1) on Thursday in Bellingham, Washington, and Simon Fraser (11-11, 8-6) on Saturday in Burnaby, British Columbia.  The Seawolves are tied for third in the GNAC with Central Washington.  The UAA women's cross-country team will try to add a second championship in as many weeks Saturday when the Seawolves compete in the NCAA Division II West Region cross-country championships in Monmouth, Oregon.  UAA coach Michael Friess said the main goal for both UAA cross-country teams is to qualify for nationals.  The UAA women — No. 4-ranked nationally — enter the meet off a win in the GNAC championships two weeks ago, but No. 1 Cal Baptist stands in their way of another title. Four West Region teams are ranked ahead of the No. 16 UAA men.  The top three teams at the region meet earn a guaranteed berth to nationals and eight other teams will be picked on an at-large basis.  Since the West Region is one of the tougher regions in the nation, Friess said UAA should earn at-large bids to nationals as long as the teams finish in the top five. But the goals are a win on the women's side and a top-three finish on the men's side.  "We think we have a shot at both (goals) if our athletes run to their potential," Friess said. "It's going to be an intense competition. We're going to have to be aggressive.  "Our women need to run at regions how they run at conference, which is upfront, pressure type of running. The guys are going to have to … press the front."

Under Armour, Inc. (UAA) is an interesting player in the Consumer Goods space, with a focus on Textile – Apparel Clothing. The stock has been active on the tape, currently trading at $12.52, down from yesterday’s close by -23.71%. Given the stock’s recent action, it seemed like a good time to take a closer look at the company’s recent data. Fundamental Analysis Does this stock stack up well when compared to its peers in the industry space? Let’s take a look. Under Armour, Inc. (UAA) currently trades with a market capitalization of $5.34 Billion. That value represents a market adjusting for revenues that have been growing by 8.74 % on a quarterly year/year basis as of the company’s last quarterly report. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For UAA, the company currently has $165.69 Million of cash on the books, which is offset by $177 Million current liabilities. You can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $91.46 Million over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to grow in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $0.19 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 30.62% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors. Technical Analysis No analysis is ever complete without a thorough survey of a stock’s technical behavior. Looking at the stock’s movement on the chart, Under Armour, Inc. recorded a 52-week high of $33.45. It is now trading 20.93% off that level. The stock is trading $16.66 its 50-day moving average by 4.14%. The stock carved out a 52-week low down at $15.52. In recent action, Under Armour, Inc. (UAA) has made a move of -25.07% over the past month, which has come on Strong relative transaction volume. Over the trailing year, the stock is underperforming the S&P 500 by 22.64, and it’s gotten there by action that has been less volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. In terms of the mechanics underlying that movement, traders will want to note that the stock is trading on a float of 14.78% with $370.49 Million sitting short, betting on future declines. That suggests something of the likelihood of a short squeeze in shares of UAA.

 Did you hear the great news at UAA?  The University of Alaska Anchorage has just started a new master's degree program in geological sciences. The M.S. degree is the primary working credential for those who find, evaluate and help develop, with rigorous environmental safeguards, Alaska's resources. This is a statement that Alaska is looking over the horizon and is ready to "grow our own" geoscientists with top-level researchers and educators right here in Anchorage. Geologists tend to be an optimistic bunch; there is always another ore deposit or oil field to discover, or geologic hazards to study and mitigate, and the excitement and optimism at UAA about this new advanced-degree program is high.  The University of Alaska is 100 years old this year. This recent action has demonstrated foresight and confidence in the future of Alaska, the university and it mission, and the fact that the university intends to be around for the next hundred years and beyond. Thank you, UAA and UA administration and Board of Regents, for creating this program.  [University of Alaska budget cut by $8 million in budget compromise]  The University of Alaska has strongly supported the growth and development of top-notch, research-grade faculty at UAA who will deliver state-of-the-art geoscience education for decades, through good times and challenging times. There has been no shortage of opportunities for Alaska geologists from Gold Rush days, through the 1964 earthquake, volcanic eruptions (including Katmai/Novarupta in 1912), discovery of the Cook Inlet and North Slope oil fields, glacial flooding, landslides, coastal erosion, groundwater supply, alternative energy, and responsible large-mine development. Most Alaskans know a geoscientist as a neighbor, friend, community volunteer or colleague.  Now, students from Alaska, other states and around the world have the opportunity to join this exciting career field or improve their professional skills. UAA's M.S. program includes both a traditional thesis-track M.S. degree option and a non-thesis M.S. degree. UAA is actively coordinating with the long-established geology and geophysics program at the University of Alaska Fairbanks to broaden opportunities available to students on both campuses. The Geology Department at UAA has received generous industry donations of advanced-technology computer software worth over $100 million along with hardware and datasets to teach students cutting-edge sedimentary basin, energy, and structural geology and geophysics.  Trained geoscientists occupying high-impact jobs are an essential building block of Alaska's continuing economic prosperity and will energize the state's economic engine for decades to come. Master's level geoscience education is critical to:  • Promoting vital long-term resource development in Alaska;  • Addressing critical gaps in U.S. energy and strategic minerals supply;  • Working as resource management and development professionals in Alaska;  • Demonstrating that resource development in Alaska is sustainable and compatible with strong environmental stewardship and social responsibility; and  • Addressing and mitigating geological hazards that may threaten people and infrastructure.  Many firms and agencies want to hire local people who are well-qualified and who understand the unique conditions in Alaska. Keeping these talented people in Alaska is good for our state.  UAA is now accepting applications through Nov. 1 for this program for the first term beginning in January 2018 at the Anchorage campus location. Happy 100th, UA, and rock on, Alaska. The future looks bright!  Stephen Trimble is chair and Jim Munter is vice chair of the Community Advistory Board to UAA's Department of Geological Sciences. The board is made up of professional geoscientists from the oil and gas, environmental consulting, mineral exploration and alternative energy industries, and from Native corporations and government agencies. More information about the master's degree program is here.   The views expressed here are the writer's and are not necessarily endorsed by Alaska Dispatch News, which welcomes a broad range of viewpoints.

As fall sports head into postseason play, UR Men’s and Women’s Basketball are beginning their preseason training, focusing on a conference championship and an NCAA tournament berth. The women were picked to win the University Athletic Association title for this season by the conference’s head coaches, receiving six first-place votes. The men were pegged to finish fourth out of eight teams, despite losing  three stars, Sam Borst-Smith, Mack Montague, and Zach Ayers, to graduation. “We have been having a great preseason so far,” senior forward Tucker Knox said. “All the returners have been playing well together and the freshman are quickly getting up to speed.” Last season, both teams received bids into the NCAA tournament. The men made it all the way into the Elite Eight but lost to Whitman College 91–87 in their final game. The women were defeated by local rival SUNY Geneseo 78–72 in the second round. With an 8–6 record in the UAA, the women finished third in the conference and were 18–9 on the season. The men finished second behind the University of Chicago in the UAA last season with a 10–4 record, and went 24–5 overall. Washington University was picked to win the men’s conference title again this season and received seven first-place votes. Emory University received the other vote for first place and was picked to finish second in the conference. The spot above UR belongs to the University of Chicago, who proved to be tough competition for the Yellowjackets in the two games they played last season. UR defeated the Bears 88–82 in the first game at home and lost 90–87 at their game in Chicago. Behind UR Women’s Basketball, the University of Chicago received two first-place votes and came second in the poll. Washington University, who went 26–3 last season, won the conference last year but were predicted to finish third in 2018.  The return of starters senior post Al Leslie, senior forward and guard Lauren Deming, sophomore guard Lauren Foley, and sophomore point guard Brenna James contributed to receiving votes for winning the UAA title. Leslie had a strong junior year with 21.9 points per game (fourth in UR history), 9.7 rebounds per game, and 44 blocks. Deming followed her with 12.3 points and 7.5 rebounds per game. Last season, Leslie earned three All-America honors and was named East Region Player of the Year by the USBWA and All-Rochester Area Player of the Year. She also set a UR single-season free throw record and holds the second-place spot in school history for single-season points, field goals, and field goal percentage. For the men, junior point guard Jacob Wittig (8.8 ppg, 4.7 apg) and Knox (5.9 ppg, 4.6 rpg) will return to the court as starters. Other key players include junior guard Ryan Clamage, who appeared in all 29 games last season and finished fifth on the team in scoring with 7.5 ppg, and junior guard Michael Mangan who played in 29 games and was ranked 16th in the UAA in steals. Senior guard Kyle Parker, the team’s manager last season, is an addition to the roster this year. He transferred from Grinnell College in the fall of 2016, where he averaged 16 points per game as a junior for the Pioneers. “We have a ton of talent and I think we could surprise people in the UAA,”  Knox said. “We look to build upon the success of last year and be a contender for UAA champions.”   UR Women’s Basketball will play their first game of the season in the Chuck Resler Tournament at the Palestra against Capital University on Nov. 17., with the men playing Bard College on the same day.

After staying quite for a long time Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) shares have recently been behaving interestingly to keep investors awake.

How has the stock performed recently? Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) in the last month has increased +10.21%. Shares are now up over the past year, outperforming the broad market by -100% and outperformed a peer group of similar companies by 216%.

     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that WMT may be headed in the future. Fortunately, there is way to use the speed and magnitude of these price changes to predict future performance, thanks to what are known as momentum indicators. As momentum slows, it might be a sign that a support or resistance level has been reached, and that a trend is about to reverse. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for WMT is 65.05%, which suggests that the stock is not particularly expensive or cheap, and not predisposed to a reactive price movement based on this measure. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 85.15%, tells a different story, and suggests that WMT currently trades in overbought territory. What do the trading volumes reveal? Price isn’t the only tool analysts use to forecast future performance. Volume patterns can also reveal some important insights. If, for instance, a stock’s volumes suddenly increase by a significant amount, it’s usually a sign that the level of conviction behind the trade is high. Investors may feel very strongly about the future direction of the stock in question. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) average trading volume of 9,156,410 during the past month is 4.34% above its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been more active than usual in the stock in recent times. What do the analysts think? WMT is currently overvalued by 0.43% relative to the average 1-year price target of $86.94 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 2.40, which implies that analysts are generally neutral in their outlook for WMT over the next year. How risky is the stock?  Absolute price performance isn’t the only thing analysts consider when predicting future performance: volatility matters as well. Beta, which measures the stock’s volatility relative to the overall market, is a simple but effective metric for assessing risk. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has a beta of 0.34, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are less extreme than the market as a whole. WMT therefore has a below average level of market risk. During the past couple of weeks, WMT average daily volatility was 12.10%, which is 2.9 percentage points lower than the average volatility over the past 100 days.

Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Technical Signals 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 WMT has witnessed its short term MA triggering a sell signal. Meanwhile, however, the long-term average has generated a buy signal. When the short-run moving average rises above its longer-term trend, a buy signal is created. This is because a short-run moving average that crosses its long-run moving average counterpart is seen as the initiation of an upward trend. On additional rally, the share price will meet short term resistance at around $88.04. On a drop, the stock is likely to find some support over the long run, which begins at $82.67. A buy signal will be generated if it crosses above the short term moving average. Meanwhile, however, a price crossing below the long term moving average will generate a sell signal. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) Support And Resistance Levels Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) recorded volume accumulation so there will probably be a surplus of buyers at $84.13. In case of gains, the next resistance from accumulated volume will not be far away from today’s level at $87.44, $87.98 and $88.65. 
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Accumulated volume is going to prevent the price from rising further at $87.44 and this action will lead the price to take a temporary pause or stay muted for a few days. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) Risk Assessment A volatility based measure Bollinger Bands suggests this stock poses high risk. In the most recent session, the stock price hovered around $1.56 between high and low, or 1.81%.

To receive further updates on this Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT) trade, sign up for a risk-free trial of Maximum Options today. A bearish opportunity I see in today’s market involves Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT). Wal-Mart seems to be trying to fight back against Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), but that’s difficult to do. Personally, I tried to buy something online from Wal-Mart, and it was very complicated compared to Amazon, which was almost automatic. And, like many people, I’m not going to spend a lot of time trying to do something when I don’t have to. It’s just a lot easier to work with Amazon than with Wal-Mart at this point. What’s more, WMT has a tendency to drop right at the beginning of the year. If you look at the chart, year after year that January drop usually occurs. Also, WMT really has had a huge gain this year, and I thought that it probably overdid it. With all that in mind, here is my recommendation for a put debit spread on WMT: Using a spread order, buy to open the WMT Jan. 19th $82.50 put and sell to open the WMT Jan. 19th $77.50 put for a net debit of about $0.90 to $0.95. Note: There are several January expirations available for WMT options. Be sure you are opening the monthly options that expire on Friday, Jan. 19, 2018. A debit spread is simply a way to lower the cost of buying options, as the option that you sell to open (short) helps offset the cost of the option that you buy to open. Therefore, this put debit spread is a way to lower the cost of buying bearish put options. Many brokers will require the use of margin and/or a set amount of reserved capital to execute a debit spread; contact your broker directly for specific requirements.

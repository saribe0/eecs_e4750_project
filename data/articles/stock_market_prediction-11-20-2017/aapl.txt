https://qz.com/1132558/apples-homepod-smart-speaker-wont-be-on-sale-until-2018-aapl/

The HomePod, Apple’s answer to Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Home smart speakers, was unveiled in June. Apple said it would be available in December, but the company announced today (Nov. 17) that it was now delaying the launch until 2018. “We can’t wait for people to experience HomePod, Apple’s breakthrough wireless speaker for the home, but we need a little more time before it’s ready for our customers,” Apple told CNBC. “We’ll start shipping in the US, UK and Australia in early 2018.” (Quartz has reached out to confirm.) It’s unusual for Apple, one of the largest electronics manufacturers in the world, which can literally make or break a supplier’s entire business by ordering parts en masse, to miss a deadline that it’s announced. It did have a similar issue with its AirPods wireless headphones last holiday season (paywall), which were originally supposed to be available in October 2016, and only started to become available closer to the end of the year. In both instances, Apple did not specify the reason for the delay, but both products revolve around audio and Siri, so it’s possible there’s a connection. Apple Watch missed 2014 holidays. AirPods missed 2016 holidays. HomePod missed 2017 holidays. That’s really bad, really – perfect gifts. — Ryan Jones (@rjonesy) November 17, 2017 It seems that Apple will be ceding the lucrative holiday shopping season to its rivals in the smart speaker market, which Amazon helped define in 2014. Whether the pull of a new Apple product will be enough to persuade consumers to hold off on buying an Echo or a Home (both of which start at $50, whereas the HomePod will cost $350) is unclear. But Apple’s device will only stream music from its own Apple Music service—couple that with the delay in releasing the product, and it’s possible that Apple will be facing an uphill battle with its speaker by the time it’s actually on the market.

After months of anticipating the release of the 10-year anniversary iPhone X, the big date finally came this month for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) investors. But now that the iPhone X is finally here, Wall Street analysts are already asking a critical question: what’s next? Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers has resumed coverage of Apple with a Market Perform rating and $195 price target. Rakers is cautious of Apple stock after it ran up roughly 50 percent in 2017 ahead of the iPhone X launch. Without clear near-term catalysts beyond the X, Rakers sees limited upside to Apple stock. “We think the shares could now see increased volatility, with a focus on incremental derivative demand and mix data points over the coming months, supply versus demand achievement (i.e., expectation of continued chasing demand into March 2018 quarter?), and upgrade and Android switcher rates,” Rakers said in a Wednesday note. Wells Fargo is calling for 81.2 million iPhone unit sales in the December quarter, including 60.1 million iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone Xs. Outside of the iPhone cycle, Rakers said U.S. tax reform is critical for Apple. If Republicans agree to a 12 percent repatriation rate, Rakers said Apple will likely repatriate all of its $252 billion in cash stored overseas, and investors will be on the lookout for increased capital return and/or potential M&A opportunities. Even with a blowout iPhone X sales cycle, it will only be a matter of time before Apple naysayers once again start questioning the company’s innovation by asking what’s next. This level of uncertainty is enough to keep Wells Fargo on the sidelines at this point. Apple’s strong 2017 has continued this month with the stock up another 2.3 percent in November.

With the recent  release of the iPhone X, Apple could become the first $1 trillion dollar company in 2018 (if Amazon doesn’t catch up), a GBH Insights analyst said in a note, according to  CNBC. Apple is currently sitting at $868.1 billion, but the number could rise over the next year as the iPhone X pushes consumers to upgrade their iPhones. The Cupertino company’s share prices could rise between $210 and $230 in 2018, the analyst, Daniel Ives, said. AAPL stock as of Thursday afternoon was at  $171.51, up from Wednesday’s $169.08 close. Wall Street analysts have predicted a  super cycle with the release to the 2017 iPhones, and Ives’ prediction is similar. The analyst said there are over 350 million users with iPhones that are at least two years old, and many of those are due for an upgrade. The analyst note said: "It all comes down to the success and elongated demand trajectory of iPhone X over the coming quarters to determine if Apple finally ends up joining the elusive trillion dollar market cap club in 2018, in our opinion. [...] To this point, the first stage of the iPhone X launch is off to a great start in what will be a crucial prove me period for Cook and Apple over the next year." The high price of the iPhone X, which starts at $999, could also play a part. Apple’s average selling price will increase from $643 in fiscal year 2017 to $746 in fiscal year 2018, Ives said. Most people could also go for the 256GB version of the iPhone X, which costs $1,149, according to GBH Insights data. As for the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, which were released in September, Ives said Apple will sell more of those models than during the peak iPhone 6 upgrade cycle. That would put the number of iPhone units for Apple's fiscal year to the end of September 2018 at 258 million, past the record 231 million that was seen in 2015. Apple’s services division, which includes Apple Music and iCloud, could also boost the company. CEO Tim Cook said  during the latest earnings call earlier this month that Apple’s services business is now the size of a Fortune 100 company. The Cupertino giant posted all-time record results for its services business, with paid subscriptions reaching 210 million at end of the September quarter. Apple Music in particular saw a 75 percent year-over-year increase in subscriptions, the company said. Ives predicts the Apple services business will reach $50 billion in revenues for the fiscal year ending September 2020. Apple’s growth in China, which Ives describes as a “renaissance,” could also allow Apple to become a $1 trillion dollar company. The analyst estimates there is an install base of 100 million iPhone users in China, with half of them due for an upgrade in the next 12-18 months. Meanwhile, In the earnings call, Apple said its revenue grew 12 percent from a year ago quarter in China. For now, Apple is predicting a strong holiday season. The company said a few weeks ago it expects the fiscal 2018 first quarter to be its biggest quarter yet. The company has been pushing its latest products to  holiday shoppers on its site, including the iPhone X, iPhone 8, Apple Watch Series 3 and the Apple TV 4K.

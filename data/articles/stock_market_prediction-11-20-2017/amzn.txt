Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) could very well be worth $1 trillion within months, and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) may not be far behind in joining the prestigious group. Morgan Stanley's Brian Nowak maintains an Overweight rating on Amazon's stock with an unchanged $1,250 price target. Amazon boasts three high-margin revenue streams that happen to be growing faster than the core retail business, Nowak said in a Sunday note. (See Nowak's track record here.) The AWS cloud segment is projected to grow at a compounded growth rate of 33 percent through 2020, followed by Other (advertising and other initiatives) at 32 percent and Subscriptions at 28 percent, the analyst said. These three units are likely to grow as large as Amazon's core retail business and contribute approximately 50 percent of Amazon's total gross profit dollars, he said.  Nowak conducted a sum-of-the-parts valuation of the pieces of Amazon's business that would drive a $1 trillion valuation: Shares of Amazon gained 0.7 percent Monday morning and are higher by 50 percent since the start of 2017.

Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) a $1-T Company Within Year $DIA, $SPY, $QQQ, $VXX, $AMZN Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) says it believes online giant  Amazon.com Inc. may reach a 2,000/share price in the next 12 months. “Amazon’s high margin aka revenue disclosure speaks to the $1-T (2,000/share) sum of parts Bull case.” Morgan Stanley reiterated its overweight rating for Amazon shares, presenting a “Bull Case” 12-month price target of $2,000/share or roughly a $1-T market cap. Amazon’s shares are trading at 1,120.50 after Hours in NYC The Seattle online giant is taking an unconventional approach to boosting sales as the Holiday shopping season begins. Amazon is cutting prices of products from 3rd-party sellers on its website, moving beyond its more typical method of discounts on items it sells directly. The “discount provided by Amazon” applies to products including board games and technological gadgets offered by other merchants as the Holiday Season approaches. The retailer has been trying to compete aggressively on some items to win sales and draw customers away from low-priced rivals like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE:WMT) The move allows Amazon to sell the products at lower prices while still giving full price to the sellers. “When Amazon provides a discount, customers get the products they want at a price they’ll love, and small businesses receive increased sales at their listed asking price,” an Amazon spokeswoman said in an emailed statement, noting that businesses can opt out at any time. Some merchants have criticized Amazon in the past for discounting and, they say, devaluing their products.

Zacks Equity Research
                    November 20, 2017
 AMZN NVDA AMAT SGH  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report)	 recently announced a deal with NBCUniversal. The deal will bring an animated film, All I Want for Christmas Is You, to its streaming service. The terms of the deal have been kept confidential. This deal will expand the movie archive of the company’s video streaming site, Amazon Prime Instant Video. Amazon Instant Video is a digital video streaming and download service that lets users rent, buy or subscribe to a range of video content. On a year-to-date basis, the company has underperformed the industry. Shares of Amazon have gained 50.7% compared with the industry’s growth of 60.1%.  The Agreement The deal will make Prime Instant Video the exclusive online subscription service to stream the new animated film based on Mariah Carey’s hit song, All I Want for Christmas Is You. The song was originally released in 1994 and became the most streamed holiday song on Amazon Music last year. Executive produced by Carey and produced by Universal 1440 Entertainment, the movie features a new original song by the multiple Grammy Award winner as well as three of her classic holiday hits. The story revolves around a young girl who must look after her uncle’s mischievous dog in the run-up to Christmas. The film will be available exclusively to Prime members in the United States and Canada. The film is also available for purchase or rent through Amazon Video. It can also be available on DVD and Blu-ray. The addition of All I Want for Christmas Is You will further boost Amazon’s program line-up, making Prime Instant Video India more attractive to viewers. NBCUniversal Deal to Drive Amazon Digital Media Sales The world’s biggest online retailer is taking all necessary steps to expand its user base in different countries and thereby increase its sales. We believe that expanding the Prime Instant Video archive is one of Amazon’s key strategies. It has been striving to boost its digital media sales and attract new users. The company is spending a considerable amount on licensing deals for movies and TV shows to attract more viewers. This deal is the latest effort by Amazon to strengthen its position against Netflix (NFLX), the leading online video subscription service in the United States. Moreover, it will help Amazon to expand its footprint in the growing streaming market at a faster rate. Amazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus     Amazon.com, Inc.

Amazon.com, Inc.  (NASDAQ: AMZN) is a retail juggernaut. And the company has shown an inclination toward scooping up companies, even in the brick-and-mortar space. The case in point is Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods Market, Inc.  (NASDAQ: WFM), which brought Amazon into the physical grocery space. Amazon has announced three rounds of  price cuts  at its Whole Foods unit since buying the grocer in June.  Against this backdrop, Citigroup analyst Paul Lejuez looked at  possible retail M&A targets  that would make sense for Amazon.  These are the retail names across Citi's coverage universe Lejuez identified as potential targets for Amazon. (See Lejuez' track record here.)  •  Abercrombie & Fitch Co.  (NYSE: ANF)

	• RH  (NYSE: RH)
	• Advance Auto Parts, Inc.  (NYSE: AAP)
	• Kohl's Corporation  (NYSE: KSS)
	• Kroger Co  (NYSE: KR) Most of the companies are bought at a 20 percent premium, according to Citi.  Teen apparel retailer Abercrombie & Fitch might be on Amazon's radar due to the following reasons:- • A low enterprise value of $620 million for the A&F and Hollister brands. 
	• Sales of $3.4 billion.
	• A campus in Columbus, Ohio. 
	• Instant infrastructure on a global basis. 
	• A young customer base.
	• An option to sell proprietary products through flagship Abercrombie & Fitch stores. Grocer Sprouts Farmers Market could pique Amazon's interest just as its bigger rival Whole Foods did, Lejuez said. The points of interest are likely to be: • The existing partnership between Amazon and Sprouts Farmers Market.
	• Potential synergies with Amazon's grocery delivery business.
	• The ability to complement the Whole Foods platform See also:  Contrarian: Amazon Is One Of The Weakest Retailers There Is Retailer Bed Bath & Beyond, which posted disappointing second-quarter results in mid-September, could be attractive to Amazon for the following reasons, according to Citi:  • Store space dedicated to online pick-up.

	• Advance Auto's inventory breadth and depth.
	• A specialized supply chain.
	• An attractive valuation relative to peers. Given the woes of the department store retail sector, an Amazon bailout could be a welcome development for Kohl's. Here's why it might make sense for Amazon:  • 1,100 off-mall stores that could be used to market Amazon's top sellers.
	• Access to proprietary and exclusive Kohl's brands. 
	• Middle American customers.
	• $1 billion-plus free cash flow.
	• Kohl's existing partnership with Amazon. Grocer Kroger could also appeal to Amazon as a potential buy due to: • Its sizeable presence in the grocery market.

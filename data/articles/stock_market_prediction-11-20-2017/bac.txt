Some of Britain's top banks are suspicious of Jamie Dimon's talks with Theresa May, but others suggest the Prime Minister is ready to listen banking's Brexit worries A few hours before Theresa May lost her second cabinet member in a week, the prime minister found time amidst the crisis to meet one of the world’s most powerful bankers. With Ms May renowned for keeping finance chiefs at arm’s length, some commercial rivals suspected special treatment in her willingness to sit down with Jamie Dimon, chief executive of US investment bank JP Morgan. Others, however, sense a subtle but significant change in the political climate with May listening more to the worries of an industry struggling to fathom out Britain’s departure from the European Union. Her talks with Mr Dimon on 8 November raised eyebrows - and some hackles - around the City of London financial centre. “It’s a bit outrageous,” said a senior executive at one of Britain’s top banks. “What other bank CEO is getting as much one-on-one face time with the prime minister? We certainly aren‘t.” From Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s to David Cameron last year, British prime ministers have traditionally held the door open for leaders of a finance industry that pays more than £70bn in UK tax every year and employs more than a million people. Not so Ms May, who has appeared reluctant to meet bank executives. Still, Mr Dimon secured the face-to-face talks between the abrupt departures of her defence and international development ministers which rocked the minority government. Shortly before last year’s Brexit referendum, Mr Dimon warned that 4,000 out of JP Morgan’s 16,000 British jobs might have to move abroad to ensure the bank could continue selling services across the remaining nations of the EU. MS Dimon has since softened his tone, but the British bank executive asked whether the original estimate had won JP Morgan the access. “I don’t know if it’s because they’ve threatened to move the most jobs - maybe we should say we’re moving 4,000 too,” he said. But something is afoot. Reuters has spoken to more than a dozen executives at large banks and government officials, with many saying May is showing greater willingness to press the City’s cause in Brexit negotiations. In return, the bankers are scaling back their plans to move jobs to rival financial centres such as Frankfurt, Paris and Dublin, at least during any transitional period after Britain leaves the EU in March 2019. BETTER CLARITY Britain and the EU have yet to begin discussing financial services at the Brexit talks, worrying bankers who fear the government has left it too late to negotiate a transition period or secure a good deal. “Our view is that the Government frankly is in chaos,” said another senior executive at a US bank. “We are really nervous.” However, Ms May outlined to Mr Dimon her vision for a transition period after Brexit day – 29 March, 2019 - and a future trade deal with the EU, easing concerns that Britain may crash out of the world’s biggest trading bloc without any agreement. A JP Morgan spokeswoman expressed cautious optimism after the Downing Street talks. “While some uncertainty remains, we feel that the Government understands the concerns of international firms such as ours, and the economy more broadly,” she said. “We were grateful for better clarity on the government’s objectives in the Brexit negotiations.” A spokesman for the prime minister did not respond to requests for comment. However, sources with knowledge of the meeting noted that she can make promises on her intentions for the Brexit talks but not on their outcome. “We got clarity on what they’re looking for, not on how it will unfold,” said the source. The bankers pressed their case for a period of adjustment to the post-Brexit financial services regime, rather than an abrupt change as soon as Britain leaves. “We’re all looking for transition and a good future deal,” said the source. In return, the JPMorgan team indicated there would be no major staff upheaval, at least on Brexit day. “They told her we will try to move as few people as possible on Day One. It will be a few hundred people and we will keep as many people as possible in the UK,” said another source. For the banks, moving top London employees to the continent is expensive and unpopular with staff reluctant to uproot their families. But longer term, a significant number of jobs may still shift if a final deal is not to their liking. CITY CHARM OFFENSIVE As in a number of countries, banks have been deeply unpopular in Britain since the global financial crisis. But their leaders felt particularly unloved after May came to power last year and cooled what critics regarded as an overly cosy relationship between the government and big business. Ms May confined her contacts with bankers largely to round table gatherings such as at Davos in January, a meeting Mr Dimon also attended. Some Wall Street bosses were left expressing frustration with a lack of detail on the Brexit process, and questioning May’s commitment to protecting the finance industry. The relationship remains measured. Ms May was scheduled to make only a five minute courtesy appearance at the talks with Mr Dimon, hosted by chancellor Philip Hammond. In the event she stayed a quarter of an hour. Still, those who connect government and business have noticed a change. Iain Anderson, executive chairman of public affairs company Cicero, said a thaw began after the Ms May lost her parliamentary majority in a June election and the government started asking companies for more input on the Brexit talks. “The mood has improved from last year when I don’t think I have ever seen businesses as emotional and angry,” said Anderson, whose firm represents many FTSE 100 companies. Government officials confirmed Ms May’s change of tack. “She is far more sceptical about engaging with business than her predecessors,” said one official, who declined to be named. “This created bitterness because people are getting less face time,” said the official, but added: “The situation has improved since the election.” Brexit minister David Davis, whose talks with chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier appear deadlocked, has led his own charm offensive in the past week or so. Mr Davis said on Tuesday the financial industry would be exempt from any curbs on immigration from the remaining EU countries. That is likely to contrast with tough new rules planned for arrivals of lower-skilled workers. In another speech, he emphasised the importance of an industry which accounts for about 12 per cent of Britain’s economic output. “When I sit round the negotiating table with Michel Barnier, or round the cabinet table with my colleagues, it’s always with the importance of the City very much in my mind,” Mr Davis said. Only a year ago, he was accusing bankers of leading a “blame Brexit festival” and lying about the number of UK employees they would have to fire.

Google attacked the EU for basing its record breaking £2.1bn fine as based on "untested antitrust theories" and ignoring pressure exerted from the likes of Amazon and eBay. REUTERS Mr Davis had surprised executives in his initial meetings by telling them they would not get any special favours in the negotiations, according to people who attended. The head of one of Britain’s largest finance companies, who has met Davis several times in the last year, said the minister has accepted the damage to the wider economy if firms go overseas. “Davis has got the message,” the executive said. According to government officials, the atmosphere has improved since the banks scaled back their estimates of how many jobs will move to more realistic levels. “There has been an effort on both sides to improve the relationship,” he said.

Shares of Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) on Wednesday Nov. 15 closed higher by nearly 2%. But that only tells half the story of BAC stock, which first had to overcome some early morning weakness. This made the day’s gain all the more impressive, and traders and active investors would now be wise and watch BAC stock closely for potential bullish trades. Regular readers of this column are well aware that I have been patiently waiting in recent weeks to buy some banking stocks. With the price consolidation over the past few weeks and pullback last week, followed by Wednesday’s bullish reversal the time seems ripe to at least dip a toe in BAC stock. Before looking at the charts of BAC stock itself let’s first note the sound technical formation of the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index (INDEXNASDAQ:BKX), of which Bank of America shares are the third-largest holding. Note that after a sharp rally that started in the fall of 2016, the index began to stall and slip into a multi-quarter sideways consolidation range by February. As summer turned into fall this year, however, the index once again began to rally and this time broke out of the consolidation range. Through this lens, the pullback over the past couple of weeks has merely retested the upper end of said range and thus could now slowly lead to a next leg higher. 
Click to Enlarge             Moving averages legend: red – 200 day, blue – 100 day, yellow – 50 day On the multi-year weekly chart, we see that BAC stock looks very similar and thus bullish. In November 2016 the stock broke past a multi-year line of resistance and then by February 2017 slipped into the aforementioned consolidation range. The breakout this past September was constructive as was the re-testing of previous technical resistance. Again, all the same as on the BKX chart above. 
Click to Enlarge             Moving averages legend: red – 200 week, blue – 100 week, yellow – 50 week Finally, on the daily chart note that the pullback over the past few days on Wednesday came to a halt right at horizontal support, i.e. previous technical resistance and the upper end of the 2017 multi-quarter sideways consolidation range. This support zone also matched up with the yellow 50-day simple moving average. The strong bullish reversal on Wednesday, Nov. 15 came in the form of a so-called bullish engulfing candle that engulfed the previous four days worth of price action. From here traders could get long BAC stock with a first upside target at $28, while respecting any bearish reversal and a last resort stop at $26 on a daily closing basis.

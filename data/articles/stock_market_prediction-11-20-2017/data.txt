“We spend less than any country in the developed world on children between the ages of zero and 5. It’s just a fact, we don’t invest enough resources.” — Ivanka Trump, assistant to the president, remarks during an interview with Tucker Carlson, Nov. 6 Ivanka Trump has vowed to champion working women and families in her role as an adviser to her father, President Trump. She has advocated for paid parental leave and to make child care more affordable; over the past few weeks, she has touted the GOP tax plan as a benefit to middle-income families. During an interview with Fox News Channel’s Tucker Carlson, Trump said the tax plan would provide relief, in the form of tax credits and deductions, to families struggling to pay for child care. Then she said something that stopped us in our tracks. She added that “we” spend less on young children than any other developed nation. “It’s just a fact,” she said. The claim seemed like a non sequitur. One minute Trump is explaining how the GOP tax cuts would help middle-income families pay for child care, and the next she is comparing the United States to other high-income countries, many of which offer a broader array of social programs and levy high taxes to pay for them. It’s a talking point we don’t expect to hear from prominent Republicans. Trump’s statement left us wondering: Is it true that the United States spends the least in the developed world on young children, and if so, what effect would a tax cut have on boosting that investment? Part of what makes Trump’s statement perplexing is that she didn’t initially specify who, exactly, spends so little on preschool-aged children. In terms of the context of the conversation, it seemed she was referring to the U.S. government. Without government investment in families, the cost of raising kids is a burden for many families, Trump argues, positioning the tax plan, which would expand the child tax credit and maintain the dependent-care credit, as a means to manage the cost. When Carlson tried to clarify, asking Trump whether she indeed meant that the “government spent less,” she initially said, “society,” then she said, “families,” laughed, changed course, and said “government.” We don’t try to play “gotcha” with political figures, so we reached out to the White House for clarity on Trump’s spending claim. A White House official said Trump was referencing a Council of Economic Advisers report that found that the United States spends less on child care and early-childhood education as a percentage of gross domestic product than almost every country in the developed world. The CEA provides the president with research and advice to support the formulation of economic policy. But the official did not send over the report initially, which raised some questions about its origins. We wondered: Could it be possible that the report was from the Obama era? We reached out to a CEA staff member from the previous administration, and he pointed us to a 2016 white paper on the economic benefits of public investment in young children. The report details at length how public investments in children ramp up once kids enter school, leaving families with younger children without much-needed support. The argument is similar to the one Trump makes on the Carlson show, except for one key thing: The report calls for greater spending on pre-kindergarten programs, not tax cuts. One of the report’s key findings is that the United States lags behind other developed countries in its public spending on young children. In 2011, based on data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the United States ranked 33 out of 36 with respect to total investment in early-childhood education relative to country wealth.  Let’s set aside the fact that Trump takes this government-spending factoid out of context to advocate for tax cuts, and take a deeper dive into the data. The OECD report on which the CEA white paper is based notes that “local governments often play a key role in financing, and sometimes provide childcare services.” But in countries such as the United States, spending at the state and local level is “not properly captured in the data and it is much more difficult to get a good view of public support for childcare across such countries.” In the United States, that means state-funded pre-kindergarten programs wouldn’t be counted. As of the 2016-2017 school year, 43 out of 50 states, as well as the District of Columbia, offer state-funded pre-kindergarten programs. According to a report by the Education Commission of the States, funding for these programs has increased by 47 percent over the past five years, and by nearly 7 percent since the previous school year. The commission estimates that in 2017 states spent nearly $7.6 billion on pre-kindergarten programs. To move the needle on public spending, however, the United States would need to invest much more than $7.6 billion, as it is such a small fraction of the U.S. gross domestic product, which hovers around $18.7 trillion.  We reached back out to the White House to confirm the 2016 white paper was in fact Trump’s source. The official confirmed. And based on this report, Trump’s claim is in the ballpark. The United States clearly lags behind most developed countries in spending on kids 5 and younger. But that doesn’t answer the question of how tax cuts would help boost public investment. There are a few problems with this premise. For one, the tax cut for families Trump touts isn’t really a tax cut for many families, as we’ve pointed out in a previous column. More than 40 percent of families with children would see a tax increase under the House GOP plan. And even if the tax cuts would keep money in families’ pocketbooks, the increased cash wouldn’t translate into increased public spending on child care. So, how did Trump wind up mashing these concepts together? It turns out that Aaron Sojourner, the author of the 2016 white paper, served as a senior economist for labor under the Obama administration and during the first five months of the Trump administration. Sojourner worked closely with Trump, providing research in support of her advocacy for women and children. In his white paper, Sojourner lays out the benefits of expanding access to high-quality pre-kindergarten programs, calling it “a win-win opportunity for participating children, their parents, and society as a whole.” Somewhere along the line, Trump decided tax cuts could be that win-win. Her political views might help to explain how Sojourner’s ideas got co-opted to suit an alternative political agenda. During the Republican National Convention in July 2016, Trump laid out her party affiliation: “Like many of my fellow millennials, I do not consider myself categorically Republican or Democrat,” she said. “More than party affiliation, I vote based on what I believe is right, for my family and for my country. Sometimes it’s a tough choice.” The Pinoccohio Test Trump claims that the United States spends less than other developed nations on children ages 5 and younger. We are generally skeptical of sweeping statements like this, but Trump’s claim caught our eye because it seemed better suited for an argument in favor of increased government spending on social programs. Yet Trump uses the factoid to advocate for the GOP tax plan, which she says would help middle-income families pay the high cost of child care. Turns out, the confusion stems from the fact that Trump pulled her talking point from an Obama-era CEA white paper advocating for expanding pre-kindergarten programs. And even though the white paper found that the United States spends less than almost every OECD country on early-childhood education, the proposed tax cuts wouldn’t boost the United States’ rank. And more important, the tax cuts Trump cites could increase taxes on 40 percent of families with children. For her mental gymnastics, we award Trump One Pinocchio. The missing context helps to explain why she stumbled through the talking point in her interview.    (About our rating scale)   Send us facts to check by filling out this form Keep tabs on Trump’s promises with our Trump Promise Tracker Sign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter Do you rate this claim as true or false?

Tightly-controlled studies used to test the safety and effectiveness of new drugs don’t always tell the whole story of how well a drug works for the thousands and sometimes millions who later take it. These drug trials often don’t often include women, minorities, and patients with additional conditions who are taking different drugs, leaving doctors unsure how a new drug will affect many of their patients. To address this problem, regulators, insurers and drug companies are now trying to gather more information about how drugs work in the real world. The idea is that this data will help them make more-informed decisions on who will likely benefit from medication — and who won’t. Tom Hubbard, vice president of policy research at the Network for Excellence in Health Innovation, a policy institute focused on health care quality and costs, recently discussed this with The Associated Press. The interview has been edited for length and clarity. ___ Q: What is real-world evidence? A: Data that is collected routinely in health care. The setting could be virtually anywhere — hospitals, physician offices, pharmacies. It can include data generated by patients themselves … how they’re reacting to a treatment, whether they’re experiencing side effects. It could include data from wearable devices like a Fitbit or smart watch. Q: Who is collecting this data? A: Virtually every big sector in health care. Many of the larger insurers have formed units to create real-world evidence through examining data they have. Increasingly, drug companies are collecting real-world data in anticipation of questions about drug effects from insurers, patient groups and clinicians. When they get accelerated approvals based on studies including few patients, they are obligated to do real-world studies and report to the FDA. Q: What’s driving this trend? A: There’s much more ability to capture data, partly because so many physicians now have electronic health records. Q: Is this data likely to help doctors and patients? A: In theory. A doctor will be able to match treatments more closely to patients. Real-world evidence should ferret out more quickly what the side effects might be. We’re talking about a shift from a data system focused on billing to one focused on answering questions of medical effectiveness. Q: Will this evidence reduce waste in the health care system and save money? A: That’s absolutely one of the great hopes for this, that as treatments become more effective, guided by real-world evidence, it would reduce costs for everybody. It could also help improve the clinical research process. Q: When will this really kick in? A: I think we’ll see more decisions informed by analysis of real-world evidence within the next five years.

 In the classic Ayn Rand novel Atlas Shrugged, the rich go “on strike” – withdrawing their services and disappearing from society in protest against taxes and regulation. Weary of carrying an ungrateful world on their shoulders, business leaders and other top income earners finally shrug, and leave the world without them. The book’s metaphor inspires political rhetoric to this day: if you tax the rich, they will leave. Variations on the threat are issued by well-off individuals all over the world – not least in the United States, where each state sets its own tax policies, and periodic warnings are issued that taxes on the rich will lead to millionaire migration to more obliging US states. When Oregon voters passed a millionaire tax at the start of this decade, for example, the state’s richest resident, Nike CEO Phil Knight, warned the tax would set off a “death spiral … in which thousands of our most successful residents will leave”. As California considered similar taxes, policymakers cautioned “nothing is more mobile than a millionaire and his money”. In New Jersey, governor Chris Christie simply stated: “Ladies and Gentlemen, if you tax them, they will leave.” But does this rhetoric stand up to statistical scrutiny? To better understand elite migration across state lines, I analysed tax return data from every million-dollar income-earner in the United States. The dataset includes 3.7 million top-earning individuals, who collectively filed more than 45 million tax returns over more than a dozen years – showing where millionaires live and where they move to. And it turns out that place still matters for the rich – much more so than we might think.  Only about 2.4% of US-based millionaires change their state of residence in a given year. Interstate migration is actually more common among the US middle class, and almost twice as common among its poorest residents, who have an annual interstate migration rate of 4.5%. While travel may be a classic “luxury good”, migration is not. Moving one’s home, life and family to a different place is mostly about people who have a poor economic fit with where they live, earn below-market incomes, and are struggling to find a livelihood. Higher income earners show low migration levels because they are not searching for economic success – they’ve already found it. When millionaires do move, they admittedly tend to favour lower-tax states over higher-tax ones – but only marginally so. Around 15% of interstate millionaire migrations bring a net tax advantage. The other 85% have no net tax impact for the movers. Furthermore, almost all of the tax-migration moves are to just one low-tax state: Florida – where low-income taxes comingle with sun, sand and palm trees. Other low-tax states such as Texas, Tennessee and Nevada do not pick up any net tax-migration. So while some millionaires have moved to lower tax states over the years 1999-2011, the flows have been too small to change the geography of the economic elite in America. The Forbes list of the world’s billionaires offers an international look at elite migration, and takes us higher up the food chain to the greatest corners of wealth. Analysis of this list shows most of the world’s billionaires – about 84% – still live in their country of birth. And among those who do live abroad, most moved to their current country of residence long before they became wealthy – either as children with their parents, or as students going abroad to study (and then staying). The world’s billionaires largely live where they were born or where they began their careers Only about 5% of world billionaires moved abroad after they became successful. These individuals readily fit the stereotype of a “transnational capitalist class” – unplugged from their nation state, travelling the world for some combination of tax avoidance and cosmopolitan lifestyle. Many of them can be found in London claiming “non-dom” status to avoid the tax laws of both their homeland and those that apply to British citizens. Others are located in tropical tax havens – such as Sir Richard Branson, who moved to the British Virgin Islands after becoming a billionaire. These jet-setting billionaires generate a lot of headlines and cynicism about tax flight. But they are anecdotal exceptions. The world’s billionaires largely live where they were born or where they began their careers. The British elite live in Britain, the Chinese elite live in China, and the American elite live in America. After making it on to the Forbes billionaire list, elites are actually more likely to die than to move to a different country. Why do the rich have such low migration rates? And why is common intuition about elite migration so wrong? It turns out that education is a big part of the remaining puzzle. People with high levels of education have very high mobility – but only for a short period after finishing their education. If you know people who have been geographically mobile, the chances are they have a higher-level education. However, once they have made a solid start to their career, the chances are also that they will not move again. Millionaire tax revenues could be used to invest in things that matter to young people starting out Migration is a young person’s game, and moving overwhelmingly occurs when people are starting their careers. By the time people hit their early forties, PhDs, college grads and high school drop-outs all show the same low rate of migration. Typically, millionaires are society’s highly educated at an advanced career stage. They are typically the late-career working rich: established professionals in management, finance, consulting, medicine, law and similar fields. And they have low migration because they are both socially and economically embedded in place. In the US tax data, while most of the millionaires’ incomes come from wages and salaries, a quarter of them also own a business. Almost all of them are married, and most have children at home. For all these reasons, places are sticky – it is hard to move after making a career and family in a place. If millionaires were mostly college-going twentysomethings not yet tied to place by career or family responsibilities, place-based income tax systems would face serious challenges. We would be trying to tax the rich exactly when they are most mobile. But this is not the case. Typically, people make decisions about where to live almost two decades before they hit their peak earnings. This shows a kind of unexpected genius behind taxes on the very highest incomes. A tax on million-dollar income serves as an intergenerational transfer, since those who pay it are the late-career working rich: socially and economically embedded in the place. In contrast, most of the people who are mobile – early career professionals – do not really care about the “millionaire tax”, because if they ever pay it, it will be decades in the future, and only if they are wildly successful. Millionaire tax revenues could be used to invest in things that matter to young people starting out: education, infrastructure, public services, urban amenities, quality of life. And this would help to attract and retain a pipeline of future top-earners, creating a virtuous tax circle. This is why places with highly progressive income taxes – such as New York and California – still thrive as centres for talent and elite economic success. Their policies focus on the pipeline of future top earners. They invest in what attracts mobile young professionals – quality of life – and only send them the bill if and when they achieve their highest aspirations.

Other low-tax states such as Texas, Tennessee and Nevada do not pick up any net tax-migration. So while some millionaires have moved to lower tax states over the years 1999-2011, the flows have been too small to change the geography of the economic elite in America. The Forbes list of the world’s billionaires offers an international look at elite migration, and takes us higher up the food chain to the greatest corners of wealth. Analysis of this list shows most of the world’s billionaires – about 84% – still live in their country of birth. And among those who do live abroad, most moved to their current country of residence long before they became wealthy – either as children with their parents, or as students going abroad to study (and then staying). The world’s billionaires largely live where they were born or where they began their careers Only about 5% of world billionaires moved abroad after they became successful. These individuals readily fit the stereotype of a “transnational capitalist class” – unplugged from their nation state, travelling the world for some combination of tax avoidance and cosmopolitan lifestyle. Many of them can be found in London claiming “non-dom” status to avoid the tax laws of both their homeland and those that apply to British citizens. Others are located in tropical tax havens – such as Sir Richard Branson, who moved to the British Virgin Islands after becoming a billionaire. These jet-setting billionaires generate a lot of headlines and cynicism about tax flight. But they are anecdotal exceptions. The world’s billionaires largely live where they were born or where they began their careers. The British elite live in Britain, the Chinese elite live in China, and the American elite live in America. After making it on to the Forbes billionaire list, elites are actually more likely to die than to move to a different country. Why do the rich have such low migration rates? And why is common intuition about elite migration so wrong? It turns out that education is a big part of the remaining puzzle. People with high levels of education have very high mobility – but only for a short period after finishing their education. If you know people who have been geographically mobile, the chances are they have a higher-level education. However, once they have made a solid start to their career, the chances are also that they will not move again. Millionaire tax revenues could be used to invest in things that matter to young people starting out Migration is a young person’s game, and moving overwhelmingly occurs when people are starting their careers. By the time people hit their early forties, PhDs, college grads and high school drop-outs all show the same low rate of migration. Typically, millionaires are society’s highly educated at an advanced career stage. They are typically the late-career working rich: established professionals in management, finance, consulting, medicine, law and similar fields. And they have low migration because they are both socially and economically embedded in place. In the US tax data, while most of the millionaires’ incomes come from wages and salaries, a quarter of them also own a business. Almost all of them are married, and most have children at home. For all these reasons, places are sticky – it is hard to move after making a career and family in a place. If millionaires were mostly college-going twentysomethings not yet tied to place by career or family responsibilities, place-based income tax systems would face serious challenges. We would be trying to tax the rich exactly when they are most mobile. But this is not the case. Typically, people make decisions about where to live almost two decades before they hit their peak earnings. This shows a kind of unexpected genius behind taxes on the very highest incomes. A tax on million-dollar income serves as an intergenerational transfer, since those who pay it are the late-career working rich: socially and economically embedded in the place. In contrast, most of the people who are mobile – early career professionals – do not really care about the “millionaire tax”, because if they ever pay it, it will be decades in the future, and only if they are wildly successful. Millionaire tax revenues could be used to invest in things that matter to young people starting out: education, infrastructure, public services, urban amenities, quality of life. And this would help to attract and retain a pipeline of future top-earners, creating a virtuous tax circle. This is why places with highly progressive income taxes – such as New York and California – still thrive as centres for talent and elite economic success. Their policies focus on the pipeline of future top earners. They invest in what attracts mobile young professionals – quality of life – and only send them the bill if and when they achieve their highest aspirations.

The UK government has been advised against a hasty shift of vital data sets from one quango to another as it aims to centralise medical data collection and management. Data on disease diagnoses, treatment and outcomes is a crucial resource for the health service, and the government has argued that better links between various parts of the NHS will benefit patients, both as individuals and overall. But efforts to centralise information and increase data sharing across the NHS have not met with great success. The most recent attempt, the Care.data scheme, was scrapped last year amid widespread criticism. The government hasn't demonstrated a particular aptitude for running major IT projects on time or budget, and the health sector is no exception. Take for instance the £11bn National Programme for IT, scrapped in 2011, and admissions that plans for a paperless NHS by 2018 were probably a bit optimistic. So it's perhaps a relief that NHS chief clinical information officer Keith McNeill's review (PDF) of proposals to move management of data sets from Public Health England to NHS Digital appear to have "proceed with great caution" stamped all over them. McNeill was asked to look at whether PHE's data collection and management activities could be moved to NHS Digital, under its auspices as the central repository for health data in the country, and how that could be achieved. His conclusion is that such a shift should only go ahead once both organisations are certain that NHS Digital has the capability and capacity to manage the data sets without any impact on data quality and performance, and after the costs had been assessed and the money was there to complete the transfer. To demonstrate this, PHE and NHS Digital should carry out a "due-diligence" process for each data set that considers the costs, risks and capabilities required for both the data transfer and its subsequent management. The pair should begin a pilot "immediately" to develop and trial a "robust and realistic" process on a significant data set, evaluate and refine it and then create a "clear methodology" that can be used for other data sets. Proposals for this work should be on the Department of Health's desk this calendar year, McNeill said. As part of McNeill's assessment, he recommended greater caution on moving some data sets than others, saying PHE should divide them into four tranches based on their complexity and the capabilities NHS Digital would need to manage them. One of these groups would be data sets that need to remain with the PHE, such as those that support real-time provision of population-facing services that are part of PHE's core functions, like lab results. The remaining data sets should then fall into three groups. The first two are those that could be moved in 12 to 18 months with "minimum if any disruption to functionality" – defined as having the capacity, capability and costs already in place – and those that would take 18 months to three years to prep for. That's followed by the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registry and the National Cancer Registry – large, specialist and complex data sets that have "intrinsic links" to other strategic health developments, and need to be considered over a longer time of three to five years.

The number of High Court cases involving employees stealing confidential data has increased by 25pc in a year, according to new figures. While the number of cases is still relatively small, up from 40 in 2015 to 50 in 2016, says EMW, the commercial law firm, the figure is rising rapidly as data theft becomes easier to carry out.  Employees today have easier access to confidential data remotely via a range of devices such as smartphones and online cloud storage platforms, making them feel more confident about taking confidential data without arousing suspicion, EMW said. Increasing staff turnover and subsequent resentment among employees is another factor driving the growth of data theft. Employees may take confidential data such as client databases or key financial information with them when they leave in order to give a competitive advantage to their new employer or a new company they are setting up. Businesses most at risk are those in the technology or financial services sectors, where staff members can steal proprietary algorithms, as well as those that are heavily reliant on client relationships such as recruitment or estate agents. One recent High Court case involved an investment management business which won against two former employees who had copied and retained files in breach of their contracts of employment. Felix Dodd, senior solicitor at EMW, said: “Data is becoming more and more business-critical – and easier and easier for staff to siphon off when they move on.” “Theft of confidential data has become such a widespread concern for firms in the City that many of them ban their employees from sending work emails to their personal accounts, and some now even disable some functions on their employees’ smartphones.” While the number of employee data theft cases is on the up, last year's figure is a long way off 2009's, when there were 95 High Court cases relating to the theft of confidential information.  At the time, EMW said that redundancies and the fall in bonuses during the recession had “prompted some disgruntled employees to steal their employers’ valuable data, such as client lists, in order to set up their own rival businesses or facilitate their move to other employers”.  Because the High Court is civil rather than criminal, employees found guilty of data theft will not be given a criminal record but may face substantial costs and a possible injunction to stop the use of the data and to have it returned.

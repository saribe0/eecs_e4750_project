General Electric announced as part of its investor update last week that it would shrink its board from its current 18 members to 12 by April of next year, while adding three new directors with “relevant industry experience.” That means nine of the board’s current directors will leave. The downsizing would make GE’s board closer in size to other large companies, and aims for closely matching board makeup to new CEO John Flannery’s turnaround plan for the troubled giant. Flannery has said he will turn things around by focusing on aviation, power and health care. That means less attention on businesses including oil and gas, transportation and lighting. That makes former ConocoPhillips CEO James J. Mulva a likely candidate to leave the board, according to the Wall Street Journal. Other possible departures include Andrea Jung and Shelly Lazarus, who are nearing planned retirement dates.  Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. Flannery has told CNBC that former Vanguard CEO John Brennan will not leave. According to the Journal, recent board addition Ed Garden of the Trian Partners hedge fund will also keep his seat.

Flannery has said the three new directors should have a “digital and technology orientation,” despite some retrenchment in GE’s once-sprawling digital ambitions.

NEW YORK -- General Electric slashed its dividend in half and will attempt to narrow its focus to three key sectors -- aviation, health care and energy -- as the conglomerate with early ties to Thomas Edison considers shedding even its historic lighting business.  The company also pulled back on profit expectations last week, and shares slumped 7.2 percent, their biggest one-day loss since the financial crisis was roiling the stock market in early 2009. New chairman and CEO John Flannery said the company is weighing the future of its transportation, industrial and lighting businesses so it can focus more intently on its most profitable divisions.   GE's quarterly dividend is being cut to 12 cents to bring payouts to shareholders closer in line with the amount of money the company is bringing in. According to S&P; Global, GE will save $4 billion a year. Flannery, speaking at GE's investor meeting in New York, said 2018 will be a "reset" year, and projected a profit of between $1 and $1.07 a share. That's well below the $1.15 a share analysts expected, according to FactSet. GE also forecast weaker cash flows than analysts had projected. Last month, Flannery said GE would shed business units worth more than $20 billion over the next year or two. It has been paring businesses for well over a decade.  He has been tasked with reviving growth and said the cost-cutting moves are intended to make GE simpler and stronger.  General Electric also said it may distance itself from Baker Hughes, the oil and gas giant of which it bought a majority stake earlier this year. Flannery said the integration of Baker Hughes into GE's business is going well, but the company seeks to lessen its exposure to volatile energy prices.  "The first 100 days maybe didn't go exactly as I was expecting," said Flannery, who became CEO in August. After a weak third quarter, Flannery said last month GE was planning major cost cuts across the board, and it would exit some businesses. The company already has surpassed its goal of cutting $1 billion in industrial costs this year, and plans more than $2 billion in cuts next year.  That is double the original target, to go with at least $20 billion in divestments over the next year or two, Flannery said. The company's board is shrinking as well, Flannery said, from 18 members to 12.  There will be three new directors with relevant industry experience, annual elections for board members, and a term limit of 15 years. Board changes will be in effect by April.  Last month, GE said two of its vice chairs will leave at the end of the year as the company continued to announce changes at the top after the end of Jeffrey Immelt's 16-year run.  The company also replaced its chief financial officer. In terms of the amount paid to investors, the dividend cut is one of the largest in U.S. corporate history. S&P; Global said the largest ever was also made by GE: the company axed $8.9 billion in annual spending in early 2009 when it cut its dividend in response to the global financial crisis. That reduced GE's quarterly payments to 10 cents from 31 cents. Posting a comment requires free registration:

By Lewis Krauskopf NEW YORK (Reuters) - General Electric Co shares stabilized after a brutal slide last week sent the stock near six-year lows, but the worst may not be over. Some investors still do not see enough value to warrant buying the shares, which have lost some of their luster as a blue-chip investment. They are sorting through massive changes announced by GE’s new Chief Executive John Flannery last Monday: hugely reduced near-term profit-growth prospects, a halved dividend, and a wave of promised divestitures.  "In a sense, the stock is trying to find an investor," said Scott Lawson, vice president of Westwood Holdings Group in Dallas, who follows industrial stocks, as the stock was sliding last week. "That investor is not a growth guy, because they are not growing. It’s not a value guy, because they’re not cheap on the value metrics." The massive decline for the stock - more than 40 percent this year - suggests that it would pique the interest of value players.  GE shares fell to $17.90, their lowest closing price since December 2011, after dropping 12.6 percent over Monday and Tuesday, their biggest two-day decline since the financial crisis. The stock edged back up over the rest of the week and closed Friday at $18.21 amid news that Flannery had bought about $1.1 million worth of the stock.  But GE shares have not fallen enough for some investors.  "What we are looking for is a sufficient margin of safety to reasonable intrinsic value, and at the current stock price, we just don’t think the margin of safety is there," Michael Kon, portfolio manager with Golub Group in San Mateo, California, said as the stock hovered around $18.  Kon said he was looking either for the stock to fall further or for better-than-expected improvement in GE's power-turbine division before any investment.  Investment advisory firm Alan B. Lancz & Associates bought some GE shares last week as the stock dipped into the $17 range, seeing value in the company's assets, which also include remaining major businesses in jet engines and healthcare, said Alan Lancz, president of the Toledo, Ohio-based firm.  But Lancz said he sees GE as an investment with a three- to five-year payoff and acknowledged the stock may fall further before that.  "We don’t see any short-term, intermediate-term catalysts but we think that there is value there," Lancz said. "It’s not high on our list of buys, but it is something that, I think for the long-term, it can be accumulated here." One question facing investors is how to assess the company against its rivals.  Over the past 20 years, GE on average has traded at 19 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. That is well above the average of 15.4 times for rival diversified manufacturers Honeywell International Inc and United Technologies Corp over that time.  Following the stock's slide this year, including fallout from third-quarter financial results last month that Flannery himself called "unacceptable," GE now trades at a discount to those companies: 16.9 times forward earnings estimates against 17.3 times for United Tech and 19 times for Honeywell.  "It is going to take a long time before you can clear the cloud and maybe get GE back to a comparable valuation level with respect to other similar companies," said Chip Pettengill, portfolio manager at Bahl & Gaynor Investment Counsel in Cincinnati. Pettengill calls GE a "tarnished blue-chip stock." GE’s earnings power is stronger than the "trough," or bottom, projected for 2018, said Scott Schermerhorn, chief investment officer at Granite Investment Advisors in Concord, New Hampshire, who sees the shares particularly discounted to other industrial companies based on enterprise value to sales comparisons. His firm has held onto the GE shares purchased earlier this year, and is considering buying more, Schermerhorn said. "The businesses they have are at least as good as a typical industrial, and therefore we think with proper management you’re going to see earnings accelerate,” Schermerhorn said, while cautioning: "It’s not going to be quick."

Japanese property owners and businesses near the Fukushima nuclear plant that melted down after a 2011 tsunami have filed a $500M class-action lawsuit against General Electric (NYSE:GE), which designed all six reactors at the facility. Original plans for the power plant called for it to be built near a bluff 115 feet above sea level, but GE - to save money - lowered the bluff to 80 feet, which "dramatically increased the flood risk," according to court papers. GE said it became aware of the lawsuit on Sunday and is "thoroughly reviewing the matter." Now read: GE Just Kicked Its Pension Problems Down The Road »

It's hard to tell whether a buyer will come forward to keep GE Transportation open and in Erie. Officials at GE Transportation seemed to be setting themselves up for long-term success when they introduced their new Tier 4 locomotive in 2014.
The new, environmentally friendly locomotive, much of it designed and tested in Erie, met two important goals. It was introduced ahead of the government's deadline, well ahead of the competition at Caterpillar and it sold better than the machine Caterpillar would eventually introduce.
The company, which went into 2015 with orders for 1,300 new locomotives, would go on to announce a record third quarter profit of $379 million in 2015.
Just two years later, those triumphs seem like footnotes.
The business is still making money — $276 million in the most recent quarter — but the leadership of parent company, Boston-based General Electric Co., has decided that selling the company's transportation and lighting business are what's best.
And it seems, absent a viable offer, there won't be much debate about that decision.
That leaves all of us, including the company, guessing at who might be in a position to buy a company with about 10,000 employees, annual revenues of $4.5 billion to $5 billion in an industry in the midst of a historic slowdown.
By most any calculation, the list of potential buyers is a short one.
The most obvious entry on that list is the former Electro-Motive Diesel. Owned for years by General Motors, EMD was long considered the leader in the freight locomotive business until the 1990s.
The company, now owned by Caterpillar, no longer makes the top-selling locomotive, but the company, one of the world's largest makers of construction equipment, has posted increasingly strong financial results over the past year.
Robert Reed, a columnist for the Chicago Tribune, wrote last week about General Electric could learn from Caterpillar as it works to restructure.
“So far, Cat's business comeback is on track,” Reed wrote. “Its workforce has declined by at least 16,000, some 30 facilities have been closed or consolidated; and it may exceed $1.5 billion in cost cuts, according to the company.”
That tendency to cut might make Caterpillar sound like a less than ideal suitor.
In an interview last week, Scott Slawson, president of Local 506 of the United Electrical, Radio and Machine workers of America at GE Transportation, spoke about potential buyers in only the broadest terms.
“If it's going to be sold, it's going to be sold to a serious player,” he said. “It's still a big business. It could still mean a merger or even a merger with another GE business.”
In a recent edition of Trains Magazine, writer Steve Sweeney offers what he calls informed speculation about possible suitors.
While Caterpillar might seem obvious at one level, Sweeney thinks anti-trust laws that prevent one company from holding a controlling interest in a given field would stand in the way.
He writes: “GE-EMD would be not just a U.S., but a worldwide monopoly for heavy-duty diesel-electric freight locomotives.”
Along with some other sources, Trains raises the possibility of a purchase by Siemens AG, a leading maker of passenger trains. There's a wrinkle, though. Siemens recently agreed to merge with Alstom, a French company that also builds passenger trains.
Trains Magazine speculates there might be room for a third partner, one with expertise and a century of experience building freight locomotives.
Either way, one thing seems clear. Although GE Transportation remains profitable, the parent company is looking to trade a player after a tough year.
Slawson said sales are expected to remain slow again in 2018 before possibly rebounding in 2019.

via Joann Lublin and Thomas Gryta at the WSJ "The fact that the board got us to this point, where in an industrial/macro upcycle the company can’t meet its financial ‘obligations,’ is rather astounding,” says analyst Scott Davis from Melius Research. General Electric's (NYSE:GE) corporate restructuring will mean the departure of a full 50% of the current 18-member board. The new board size will be twelve, meaning three new members. "It’s highly unusual even for a few directors to depart at a given time,” says Korn/Ferry's Dennis Carey. "It is difficult to pick out who goes." One can speculate though, and with CEO John Flannery's hope to sell GE's stake in Baker Hughes, former Conoco CEO James Mulva may lose his spot on the board (held since 2008). Also likely to exit are longest-serving board members Andrea Jung (19 years) and Shelly Lazarus (17 years). After having sold off a major swath of its financial services businesses, GE is no longer a bank masquerading as an industrial company, so those board members with finance industry backgrounds could also be tapped for exit.

CEO John Flannery says GE Power can stay, but it needs to slash its budget by $1 billion. Flannery, who replaced Jeff Immelt as GE's leader over the summer, laid out his highly-anticipated vision for the company on Monday in a meeting with analysts that lasted nearly three hours. As expected, Flannery said that GE would exit businesses such as lighting and locomotives while it focuses on core businesses such as aviation, health care and its power plant business, known as GE Power. That's good news for downtown Schenectady, where GE has its power business headquarters and employs roughly 4,000 people. It's also good for the additional 2,000 people that work for GE Global Research in Niskayuna. Flannery praised the Niskayuna lab in his remarks Thursday and just said that GE is looking to close some foreign labs, but Niskayuna will remain open. Local officials praised Flannery's remarks, noting that he reaffirmed the importance of GE's local operations. "GE's investor presentation today affirmed the important role played by GE's Global Research Center in Niskayuna and the fact that GE Power is an integral part of the company," Ray Gillen, chair of the Schenectady County Metroplex Development Authority said Monday. "Power is one of three core businesses that the company is focused on moving forward. While GE Power is facing a challenging global environment, today's presentation reaffirmed GE's commitment to being a world leader in the power business building on the fact that 30 percent of the world's electricity supply is produced by turbines and generators built by the company." But the good news was also tempered by the news that Flannery wants to cut $1 billion in annual expenses from GE Power, a move that could spell job cuts in Schenectady, although the company has declined to provide any specific details on how the cost-cutting would be executed. Flannery has not hidden his disappointment with GE Power, which posted disappointing third quarter results that dragged down GE's overall earnings during the period and continued years of disappointing performance by GE's stock. "We have not performed well for our owners," Flannery said during the analyst meeting, held in New York City. "That is unacceptable." Just a few hours before Flannery made his remarks, he also cut GE's dividend paid to stockholders in half, dropping it to 12 cents per share from 24 cents. "We understand the importance of this decision to our shareowners and we have not made it lightly," Flannery said when he announced the dividend cut. "We are focused on driving total shareholder return and believe this is the right decision to align our dividend payout to cash flow generation." During the third quarter, GE Power's revenue dropped 4 percent to $8.7 billion, and its operating profit was down 51 percent to $611 million as GE overall saw its profits drop 10 percent. Flannery blamed the drop on poor execution and a buildup of excess inventory from overly optimistic sales projections. As a result, GE Power CEO Russell Stokes is tasked with cutting $1 billion from GE Power's annual expenses. Stokes, who is based in Atlanta, said some of the problems at GE Power had to do with GE's previous projections of capacity payments that power plants earn to have readily available electricity to send onto the grid. Because of that, fewer power plant owners are paying for upgrades to power plants that GE provides. "The U.S. market is clearly softer than we (anticipated)," Stokes said. Flannery's announcement on the dividend cut and his vision for GE's future rattled Wall Street and sent investors scrambling for the exits. Shares of GE (GE:NYSE) fell $1.47, or 7.17 percent, to $19.02 a share, a five-year low for the company that has already been dogged by complaints about its sagging stock price.

With three days to go for the University of Mumbai’s (MU) Law exams, many students are yet to receive their re-evaluation results. A delegation of students met Controller of Examinations Arjun Ghatule on Friday. The students were assured that all re-evaluation results would be declared by Saturday. “We had been assured that the results would be declared before the semester exams, but the university has failed to keep its word. Now, it should further postpone the exams. How can students appear for the exams without knowing if they have passed the earlier ones? Besides, where is the time to prepare for exams? The MU should also reschedule two papers scheduled on November 21 and 23, as they clash with the Company Secretary exams,” said Sachin Pawar, president of the Student Law Council. The students have now threatened to escalate their agitation to scrap the online assessment process. Second-year Law student Siddharth Ingle gave three papers for re-evaluation, but is awaiting results of two. The university has failed to produce a photocopy of his first year exam answer sheet as well. “I have got 30 marks in three subjects. How is it possible? ” he asked.

Source: Shutterstock The good times just keep rolling for chip-maker Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU). MU stock has now climbed from $10 in early 2016 to $45 today. The big run has been fueled by a favorable limited supply, big demand dynamic in the DRAM market, which has led to a surge in revenues and profits. When I say surge, I mean surge. Revenues went from $12.4 billion in fiscal 2016 to $20.3 billion in fiscal 2017. More impressively, MU turned a $276 million net loss in 2016 into a $5.1 billion net profit in 2017. But this is a cyclical industry. When the times are good (like they are today), one of the major suppliers boosts capacity to either maintain or grow market share. That brings product prices down, eats away at margins, and just like that, MU’s $5.1 billion in profits are gone. Are we at the top of the cycle? Close, but not there yet. Consequently, MU stock should keep grinding higher. I think $50 is a good level to watch for this name. Here’s how I get there. Things are on fire right now in the DRAM market. The supply-demand dynamics in the global DRAM market remained favorable in the third quarter of 2017. Revenue was up 16% sequentially and hit a record high. Contract prices rose 5% due to booming demand on top of limited supply. That is key, because it implies higher profit margins for MU. Those favorable supply-demand dynamics will actually grow more favorable in the fourth quarter, thanks to booming mobile demand. Going into the fourth quarter, the DRAM market is one of limited supply amid some headline smartphone launches. That gives suppliers big pricing power. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd is already raising the quotes of its mobile DRAM products. Because of this, mobile DRAM prices could rise between 10% and 20% in the fourth quarter. That robust growth will lead to overall DRAM price growth of around 10%, estimates DRAMeXchange. Because of this exceptionally favorable supply-dynamic heading into the fourth quarter of calendar 2017, now seems like a good time to own MU stock. This might be one of the best quarters for MU in company history. But that record quarter won’t be the new normal. It certainly appears as though we are nearing peak cycle in the DRAM market. Samsung is reportedly shifting from a technology migration focus in 2017 to a capacity expansion focus in 2018 in order to preserve its dominant market share. New product will flood into the market, causing the current limited supply situation to be less favorable into the foreseeable future.

http://www.columbiatribune.com/news/20171116/mu-approves-using-pigs-for-er-training-over-protests-of-dc-based-group

 An effort to persuade the University of Missouri to stop using live pigs to train emergency room doctors has failed.On Thursday, the Washington, D.C.,-based Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine brought national advocates and local activists together outside University Hospital to bring public pressure to bear to end the use of swine in physician training. The demonstration was organized after MU declined to agree to the group's call to abandon the use of pigs.The university’s Animal Care and Use Committee, in a vote earlier this month, approved continuing the protocol governing their use through November 2020.MU is the only one of five emergency residency programs in the state that still uses pigs, said Kerry Foley, a retired emergency physician who worked for Georgetown University and other hospitals for 26 years. Only 16 of 211 emergency residency programs in the U.S. and Canada use pigs to train doctors, according to a survey conducted by the organization.“They were used originally because the technology wasn’t available and now the technology is available,” Foley said as she picketed the hospital with about a dozen others. “You can now obtain things called perfused cadavers, which are very lifelike and true to the experience of working on real patients.” In a statement to the Tribune, MU defended the use of live pigs as an important supplement to training done in simulation labs.“Our goal at the University of Missouri is to provide our emergency medicine resident physicians the skills and procedural knowledge necessary to save the lives of our patients,” spokeswoman Jennifer Coffman wrote.It is not possible to do complete training through simulations, she wrote.“In the extremely rare instances (approximately six animals per year) when we need to train emergency medicine resident physicians on life-saving measures that are not adequately replicated through simulation, we use humane and strict protocols that are reviewed by the university’s Animal Care and Use Committee.”According to the protocol, pigs provide training a simulated patient cannot to practice life-saving techniques.“These procedures when required on humans need to be performed rapidly and accurately,” the protocol approved in 2015 states. “Allowing physicians to train on pig models allows this to happen.”According to the protocol, the eight residents accepted each year for the three-year program need six pigs for every six month session to complete the training. Each pig is anesthetized before training begins and then subjected to eight procedures. The first is to cut through the skin to a vein for access, followed by inserting a deep line to administer fluids, opening the abdomen to determine if fluid is accumulating and inserting an electrode through a vein to reach the heart.The next steps are inserting a chest tube to remove fluid, opening the chest to reach the heart and cutting an airway into the throat. After the pig is dead, the residents learn a technique to drain fluid from the sac around the heart.“Procedures will be performed multiple times by multiple residents on the same animal,” the 2015 protocol states.None of that training requires a pig, Foley said.“We would put forward that the use of baby pigs to teach surgical airway techniques to these residents or chest tube insertions to these residents, it is not true to human anatomy,” she said. “It is much more germane for the students to be learning on actual clinical anatomy models.”Columbia registered nurse Nestor MacKno took part in the demonstration. He said he has been a nurse for 30 years and opposes all research using animals.

On Thursday, the Washington, D.C.,-based Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine brought national advocates and local activists together outside University Hospital to bring public pressure to bear to end the use of swine in physician training. The demonstration was organized after MU declined to agree to the group's call to abandon the use of pigs. The university’s Animal Care and Use Committee, in a vote earlier this month, approved continuing the protocol governing their use through November 2020. MU is the only one of five emergency residency programs in the state that still uses pigs, said Kerry Foley, a retired emergency physician who worked for Georgetown University and other hospitals for 26 years. Only 16 of 211 emergency residency programs in the U.S. and Canada use pigs to train doctors, according to a survey conducted by the organization. “They were used originally because the technology wasn’t available and now the technology is available,” Foley said as she picketed the hospital with about a dozen others. “You can now obtain things called perfused cadavers, which are very lifelike and true to the experience of working on real patients.”   In a statement to the Tribune, MU defended the use of live pigs as an important supplement to training done in simulation labs. “Our goal at the University of Missouri is to provide our emergency medicine resident physicians the skills and procedural knowledge necessary to save the lives of our patients,” spokeswoman Jennifer Coffman wrote. It is not possible to do complete training through simulations, she wrote. “In the extremely rare instances (approximately six animals per year) when we need to train emergency medicine resident physicians on life-saving measures that are not adequately replicated through simulation, we use humane and strict protocols that are reviewed by the university’s Animal Care and Use Committee.” According to the protocol, pigs provide training a simulated patient cannot to practice life-saving techniques. “These procedures when required on humans need to be performed rapidly and accurately,” the protocol approved in 2015 states. “Allowing physicians to train on pig models allows this to happen.” According to the protocol, the eight residents accepted each year for the three-year program need six pigs for every six month session to complete the training. Each pig is anesthetized before training begins and then subjected to eight procedures. The first is to cut through the skin to a vein for access, followed by inserting a deep line to administer fluids, opening the abdomen to determine if fluid is accumulating and inserting an electrode through a vein to reach the heart. The next steps are inserting a chest tube to remove fluid, opening the chest to reach the heart and cutting an airway into the throat. After the pig is dead, the residents learn a technique to drain fluid from the sac around the heart. “Procedures will be performed multiple times by multiple residents on the same animal,” the 2015 protocol states. None of that training requires a pig, Foley said. “We would put forward that the use of baby pigs to teach surgical airway techniques to these residents or chest tube insertions to these residents, it is not true to human anatomy,” she said. “It is much more germane for the students to be learning on actual clinical anatomy models.” Columbia registered nurse Nestor MacKno took part in the demonstration. He said he has been a nurse for 30 years and opposes all research using animals. He said he eats meat but won’t purchase any product that has been raised in a manner he considers inhumane. “I think they need to modernize medical training to bring it in line with the rest of the country,” McKno said. “I have been involved in this for a long time.

Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: MU) has became attention seeker from the inquisitor when it experienced a change of -0.04% Whereas, in last 21 trading days was 11.74% and moved up in last 63 trading days of 56.16%.

Every trader dreams of taking a small amount of capital and becoming a millionaire off of it. The reality is that it is unlikely to occur by trading a small account. While profits can accumulate and compound over time, traders with small accounts often feel pressured to use large amounts of leverage or take on excessive risk in order to build up their accounts quickly. Not realizing that professional fund managers often make less than 10-15% per year, traders with small accounts often assume they can make double, triple or even 10 times their money in a single year. A strategy doesn’t need to win all the time to be profitable. Many traders only win 50% to 60% of their trades. The point is, they make more on their winners than they lose on their losers. Make sure that the risk on each trade is limited to a specific percentage of the account, and that entry and exit methods are clearly defined and written down. There are times when the stock markets test your nerves. As a day trader you need to learn to keep greed, hope and fear at bay. Decisions should be governed by logic and not emotion. One strategy is to set two stop losses: Analytical Significance of Simple Moving Average The SMA200 of the stock is at 46.89%, SMA20 is 6.35%, while SMA50 is 15.16%. MU’s relative volume was 0.68. Relative volume is a great indicator to keep a close eye on, but like most indicators it works best in conjunction with other indicators and on different time frames. Higher relative volume you will have more liquidity in the stock which will tighten spreads and allow you to trade with more size without a ton of slippage. MU’s overall volume in the last trading session was 22,568,964 shares. Important Technical Indicators to keep in Focus:- A statistical measure of the dispersion of returns (volatility) for MU producing salvation in Investors mouth, it has week volatility of 2.60% and for the month booked as 2.69%. Regardless of which metric you utilize, a firm understanding of the concept of volatility and how it is measured is essential to successful investing. A stock that maintains a relatively stable price has low volatility. When investing in a volatile security, the risk of success is increased just as much as the risk of failure.  Micron Technology, Inc.’s beta is 1.78 whilst the stock has an average true range (ATR) of 1.23. Other technical indicators are worth considering in assessing the prospects for EQT. RSI for instance is currently at 70.47. It is common practice for investors to use the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio or price multiple) to determine if a company’s stock price is over or undervalued. Companies with a high P/E ratio are typically growth stocks. However, their relatively high multiples do not necessarily mean their stocks are overpriced and not good buys for the long term. The PEG ratio shows us that, when compare to the beer company, the always-popular tech company doesn’t have the growth rate to justify its higher P/E, and its stock price appears overvalued. Micron Technology, Inc.’s currently has a PEG ratio of 0.60 where as its P/E ratio is 10.67. The company P/S (price to Sales) ratio is 2.62, P/B (price to Book) ratio is 2.75, while its P/C (price to Cash) ratio stands at 9.81. Should You Go With High Insider Ownership? Many value investors look for stocks with a high percent of insider ownership, under the theory that when management are shareholders, they will act in its own self interest, and create shareholder value in the long-term. This aligns the interests of shareholders with management, thus benefiting everyone. While this sounds great in theory, high insider ownership can actually lead to the opposite result, a management team that is unaccountable because they can keep their jobs under almost any circumstance. Currently Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU)’s shares owned by insiders are 0.20%, whereas shares owned by institutional owners are 85.60%. November 20, 2017 November 20, 2017 November 20, 2017

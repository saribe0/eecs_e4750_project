As of Nov 8, around 77.4% of the tech sector companies on the S&P 500 index reported their Q3 earnings results. Total earnings for these are up 23.2% from the same period last year on 10.9% higher revenues, with 81.3% surpassing EPS estimates and 87.5% beating on revenues. Strong earnings performance by the tech sector put the spotlight on its major sub-sector, semiconductor. In this quarter, of the eight companies that make up the broader Zacks industry, six have already reported earnings, with five beating their Zacks Consensus Estimate. Each of the three major semiconductor chip makers, Intel Corp. INTC, NVIDIA Corp. NVDA and Texas Instruments Inc. TXN may have fundamental differences but came up with upbeat third-quarter results. In this context, let us now perform a comparative analysis of the leading players in the Semiconductors sector to pick the best investment option based on their earnings scorecard. Both Intel and NVIDIA have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while Texas Instruments has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Third-Quarter Earnings Intel Corp. reported third-quarter non-GAAP earnings of $1.01 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 21 cents. The figure surged 26.3% from the year-ago quarter and 40.3% sequentially. The strong earnings growth was driven by better-than-expected top-line performance and operating margin expansion. Revenues totaled $16.15 billion, up 2.4% year over year and 9.4% quarter over quarter. The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.71 billion. The top-line growth came on the back of strong data-centric growth. (Read More) NVIDIA Corporation reported stellar fiscal third-quarter results, continuing its earnings streak for the 10th straight quarter. This graphic chip behemoth posted quarterly earnings of $1.33 per share on a non-GAAP basis, up nearly 60.2% year over year. The bottom line also came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 94 cents. Also, revenues surged 31.5% year over year to $2.636 billion, and comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.364 billion, as well as management’s projection of $2.35 billion. (Read More) Texas Instruments reported third-quarter earnings of $1.26 per share, beating the consensus mark by 14 cents. Earnings also increased 34% year over year and 22.3% sequentially. Strong results were mainly driven by strength in the auto and industrial markets. Revenues of $4.15 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $199 million and were up 12% on a year-over-year basis and 11.5% sequentially. The top line came ahead of the guided range of $3.74–$4.06 billion. (Read More) Guidance Intel guided fourth-quarter revenues of around $16.3 billion, up 3% year over year excluding McAfee. The projected figure is better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16.12 billion. Further, non-GAAP earnings are anticipated at 86 cents per share, up 15% on a year-over-year basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at 83 cents. For fiscal fourth-quarter, NVIDIA expects revenues of approximately $2.65 billion, which is much above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.44 billion. Moreover, Texas Instruments expects revenues between $3.57 billion and $3.87 billion. The mid-point of the guidance is above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.67 billion. Earnings for the quarter are expected in the range of $1.01 to $1.15 per share. The lower end of the range is in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Price Performance In the last year, NVIDIA has outperformed the industry with an average gain of 126.7% compared with 53.1% increase for the latter. Although, Intel and Texas Instruments have advanced 30.6% and 35.4%, respectively in the last one year, both the companies underperformed the industry. NVIDIA is a clear winner on this count. Earnings History and Estimate Revisions All the three major chipmakers delivered positive surprises in each of the last four quarters. Intel, NVIDIA and Texas Instruments posted an average positive earnings surprise of 9.8%, 33.5% and 9.2%, respectively. In the last 30 days, Intel’s current-quarter estimates increased by 4 cents to 86 cents per share, while that for the current year advanced from $3.00 to $3.23 per share. NVIDIA’s current-quarter estimates advanced from $0.96 to $1.13 last month while current-year estimates jumped by 52 cents to $4.13 per share. Texas Instruments’ current-quarter estimates rose 7 cents to $1.08 last month and current-year estimates climbed from $4.13 to $4.33 per share. NVIDIA holds an edge over the other two companies with respect to both earnings history and estimate revisions. Valuation The price-to-sales ratio is particularly relevant in a consumer-focused industry like semiconductor manufacturing, the fortunes of which are dictated by the variation in sales. This ratio is ideal for comparing companies from same sector by dividing the stock price of the company with its sales. Coming to the three stocks under consideration, NVIDIA and Texas Instruments are overvalued than the industry, which has a P/S ratio of 4.59. NVIDIA is also pricier than the other two, since it has a P/S ratio of 11.76, higher than Intel’s and Texas Instruments’ respective reading of 3.36 and 6.25. Clearly NVIDIA is overvalued than both Intel and Texas Instruments. Conclusion In our comparative analysis, we find that the P/S ratio of NVIDIA is higher than both Intel and Texas Instruments. However, when considering price performance, NVIDIA holds a strong edge over Intel and Texas Instruments. Moreover, in the third quarter, NVIDIA witnessed considerably better year-over-year earnings growth than the other two chipmakers. Additionally, when we take a more comprehensive look at the companies’ previous earnings performance and estimate revisions, NVIDIA is clearly the best stock among the three chipmakers. In this respect, it can be concluded that NVIDIA is clearly a better investment proposition than Intel and Texas Instruments. Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tech-roundup-nvda-pcln-trip-210109196.html

Earnings season is drawing to a close with most of the S&P 500 having reported already, making NVIDIA NVDA easily the hottest earnings from last week. The online travel agents continued to disappoint, with both Priceline PCLN and TripAdvisor TRIP shares plummeting. These and Intel’s INTC deal with Advanced Micro Devices AMD were the top stories from last week- Earnings NVIDIA: NVIDIA reported very strong revenue and earnings growth in its fiscal third quarter, easily beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both top and bottom lines. Gaming (driven by strength across geographies and form factors, Nintendo Switch and cryptocurrencies) Data Center (driven by cloud service providers and HPC) and Professional Visualization (driven by VR adoption at defense and automotive customers, stronger demand for high-end real-time rendering, simulation and more powerful mobile workstations) were all up strongly from last year. The guidance indicates that the strength will continue. Priceline: Priceline reported a strong quarter with both top and bottom lines ahead of the respective Zacks Consensus estimates. The company’s hotel revenues did better than its rental cars and flight bookings, both of which saw weaker volumes. While bookings at the start of the current quarter were at the high end of management expectations, so can’t be considered unusually weak, the guidance was disappointing even by Priceline’s standards (it usually guides conservatively). The reason for the weakness, especially on the hotels side isn’t clear but could be because of efforts by hotels to reach customers directly rather than through a distribution channel. TripAdvisor: TripAdvisor reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings on revenues that disappointed. While revenues continued to grow albeit very slowly, earnings dropped over 32% from last year. The hotels side of the business was weak, with other revenues (from attractions, restaurants and vacation rentals) remaining strong. The company burnt cash and saw a reduction in its net cash position. Intel & AMD Finally Have a Deal Everyone expected Intel and Advanced Micro Devices to get closer together after Intel’s forced licensing deal with archrival NVIDIA expired in Jan 2017. But one of the things that stood in the way was the fact that AMD also competed with Intel, on multiple fronts. For AMD, licensing technology to Intel would mean sacrificing profits from chip sales in exchange for royalties from a larger number of chips. It was likely a difficult decision, made easier only by the fact that their combination could help them take share in a market they were both targeting (i.e. high-end gaming laptops), one that is currently dominated by the common enemy NVIDIA. There are also other areas of interest. The first would be the shrinking PC market and Intel’s need to maintain position while investing in emerging areas like AI, cloud, IoT, auto, etc. The second would be AMD’s unattractive financials that would improve with a steady flow of revenues from Intel. Third, AMD’s limited presence in the PC gaming segment (the only part of the PC market that still has attractive growth rates) where its discrete GPUs are up against NVIDIA’s, but where Intel has limited presence because it only sells an integrated version. Marrying AMD graphics with Intel processing power would strengthen the integrated solution versus the discrete one. For those with any doubts about whether the relationship is a short term one or part of a larger-scale alliance between the two, it’s worth noting that AMD VP and chief architect of the Radeon Technologies Group, Raja Koduri is now an Intel employee as its chief architect, SVP of its newly formed Core and Visual Computing Group, and GM of a new initiative to drive edge computing solutions. The actual product details are limited at this point, but Intel has said that this will be part of its 8th Gen Intel Core family, bringing together its high-performing Intel Core H-series processor, second generation High Bandwidth Memory (HBM2) and a custom discrete graphics chip from AMD’s Radeon Technologies Group – all in a single processor package. The integration will be facilitated with Intel’s Embedded Multi-Die Interconnect Bridge (EMIB) that will be used for the first time in a consumer device. The purpose of the integration is to fit in more power and performance with better thermal dissipation and consuming less energy into a smaller form factor.

Apple Supplier Planning India Expansion: Wistron Corp, Apple’s iPhone assembler in India is looking for 100 acres of land in Bangalore and have short-listed a few parcels of land, Bloomberg reports. Apple currently assembles only the SE in India and all the high end models are still imported, so they have an import duty stacked on the already-high prices. Nevertheless, Wistron said that the additional capacity may also be used for customers other than Apple. Raja Koduri Joins Intel: Intel plans to make a mark in the graphics chip business, where it is a secondary player to AMD and NVDIA. So just before NVIDIA reported, the company announced that it had whisked away Raja Koduri, senior vice president and chief architect of the Radeon Technologies Group at AMD to head this effort. Koduri has more than 25 years of experience in graphics hardware, software and system architecture in visual and accelerated computing advances across a broad range of devices, including PCs, game consoles, professional workstations and consumer devices. Davidson Sees Cisco Share Loss: Mark Kelleher of D. A. Davidson is excited about Arista Networks’ stellar results and strong revenue growth rate and thinks it will continue to take market share away from Cisco for years to come. Accordingly, the analyst raised his price target on the shares from $180 to $224 while upgrading the shares from Neutral to Buy. The strong results were despite weaker-than-expected revenues from the top cloud vendors because of a product workaround related to Cisco patents, which therefore extended the qualification with them. Other analysts conceded that the company was growing strongly but also pointed to the rich valuation that kept some of them on the sidelines. Microsoft Buys Chevron Data Center: Just a day after Microsoft signed a 7-year deal to provide cloud computing services (including data analytics and IoT) to the giant energy company Chevron Corp, its subsidiary Chevron USA sold its 5200 Rogers Road data center to Microsoft. While the purchase price was kept under wraps, the Bexar County Appraisal District fixes the value at $80 million. The company’s massive operational scale generates 1TB of data per day, which can be processed to generate operational efficiencies and savings for the company. Tesla Nabs Microsoft Engineer: Microsoft just lost Scott Simms, one of the leading engineers at its video game engineering unit to Tesla as its "Director of UI Engineering." Simms’ LinkedIn profile says that he was involved in "AR & 3D reconstruction on mobile devices.” He also says that he managed computer vision, UI and app teams developing monocular SLAM and 3D reconstruction running real time on resource constrained hardware. Amazon Pop-Ups at Whole Foods Stores: For the holidays, Amazon will be opening pop up stores within 100 Whole Foods outlets in Illinois, Michigan, Florida, California and Colorado so people can try Amazon devices and familiarize themselves with Prime and other subscriptions. Whole Foods is also offering Black Friday deals on Amazon's merchandise, including $20 off the Echo Dot, $20 off the new Amazon Echo, $30 off the new Echo Plus and $30 off the Fire HD 8 tablet. The stores already process Amazon returns and have Amazon lockers for product pickup. The integration is going well and further plans are afoot that might see Prime members getting special deals inside Whole Foods stores. Amazon’s Echo Group of Devices in Japan: Amazon has now introduced Alexa and its Echo group of devices to Japanese customers. Alexa for Japan has been built from the ground up especially for Japanese customers with a new Japanese voice, local knowledge and over 250 skills from Japanese developers. Legal/Regulatory Israeli Startup Claims Apple Infringed Its Tech: Tel Aviv-based Corephotonics, which has raised $50 million from several high-profile venture capital firms and other investors, has filed a patent infringement case against Apple. The company claims that Apple had used its patented dual camera technology in its Phone 7 Plus and iPhone 8 Plus without authorization. According to the filed complaint, "Apple’s lead negotiator expressed contempt for Corephotonics’ patents, telling [CEO] Dr. Mendlovic and others that even if Apple infringed, it would take years and millions of dollars in litigation before Apple might have to pay something." Samsung Ventures, Apple supplier Foxconn and chipmaker MediaTek are investors in Corephotonics through its latest funding round in January. Other investors include Magma VC, Amiti Ventures, Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing and Solina Chau’s Horizon Ventures, flash storage maker SanDisk and Chinese telephone services provider CK Telecom. Waymo-Uber Lawsuit Update: U.S. District Judge William Alsup, in an order the details of which were kept secret to allow both sides an opportunity to review his reasoning privately, has dealt a big blow to Alphabet’s Waymo in its case against Uber. The case was about the theft of intellectual property by one Anthony Levandowski, who stole files and transferred the information to his self-driving trucking company called Otto Trucking that was soon acquired by Uber. The ruling is a blow on two counts; the first being the disqualification of Waymo’s damages expert/striking out of the report on which he is relying (it’s hard to tell which or both from media reports currently available) and the second, the removal of Otto as a joint defendant in the case. Without the expert, it could be harder for Waymo to prove why it deserves a billion dollars in damages on a case involving technology that hasn’t yet come to market. Without Otto in the picture, it will be harder for Waymo to fix responsibility on Uber, since the technology moved through Otto to Uber. New Products/Technology Apple AR Glasses: Bloomberg says that according to people familiar with the matter, Apple will have an AR headset powered by a new chip and with its own display and operating system ready to ship by 2019. Apple is moving aggressively, according to the people although the deadline could still get pushed back. CEO Tim Cook who is extremely positive about the technology, has said that he already sees how AR will “transform the way you work, play, connect and learn” and the way that’s it’s going to “change the way we use technology forever.” Housing Rentals Come to Facebook Marketplace: Facebook is partnering with companies like Apartment List and Zumper, which are in turn working with brokers, agents and property managers to greatly expand the list of housing rentals on the platform. Users looking for suitable homes will be able to filter results based on location, price, rental type, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, square footage, pet-friendliness and other criteria. Users can also put up their own listings directly to the site using 360 degree images. Google Files Go: Google is working on a new app called Files Go to be available as a part of the stock Android version, for file management, sharing and cleaning. Sharing files on Android devices is possible, if not too comfortable today. So both users have to have the concerned app open and have to tap their phones together to make the connection via NFC. It’s awkward and not very well known among users. Files Go will likely solve this problem. Additionally, it will also help to clean up disk space. The app has a dashboard that shows how much storage your phone has left, a button to clear cached files, and suggestions to remove large files that you’re apparently not using any more, all with the goal of freeing up space. There’s also a files manager that lets you browse through local photos, videos, music and other documents. Amazon Fire TV Stick Across 100 Regions: Amazon has launched the basic version of its Fire TV stick in over 100 more countries, so people can simply plug the device into the HDMI port of their HDTVs to stream the latest shows, Amazon Prime content and also play games. Customers can also set their default language as Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, French, Italian, German or English. Collaborations and M&A Apple Acquired InVisage: Apple has acquired an image technology company that raised $98 million from various sources including Nokia and Intel Capital. The reason these companies were interested in InVisage is a technology called QuantumFilm that appears to be a breakthrough in materials science. This specialized device works with dedicated software to deliver highly accurate images in a very small form factor and even in low light conditions. Considering the way technology is developing, image processing is a super-important market with scope for application in not only smartphones and computing devices, but also IoT, security, automotive, AR/VR, filming and others. This is likely to be an important piece of technology for Apple, but one that we won’t know much more about because of the size of the acquisition that makes it immaterial to Apple’s operations, which therefore doesn’t carry a statutory requirement to disclose. Microsoft-Ola: Microsoft has signed an important alliance with Ola Cabs of India that will see the ride-hailing service transfer automotive data to Microsoft’s Azure instead of Amazon’s AWS and integrate Microsoft’s artificial intelligence and productivity tools into Ola Play (the company's existing connected car platform). This appears to be a step toward Ola’s self-driving car goals and furthers Microsoft’s objective of wresting corporate customers from AWS. In the meantime, it also enables improved in-car productivity (users get Office 365 and Skype for Business, as well as voice-assisted controls built using Microsoft Cognitive Services and Bot framework, in-car during their rides), vehicle diagnostics,  advanced navigation and predictive maintenance of vehicles. Ola recently raised around a $1 billion in a funding round that included Tencent and Japan’s Softbank. Google, Salesforce Get Cozier: Google and Salesforce are integrating their software so their solutions are more complete, useful and competitive versus offerings from Microsoft Azure. Of course Salesforce also integrates with AWS, the other major Azure (and Google Cloud) competitor. In Google’s case, the partnership involves Salesforce CRM working closer together with Google G Suite productivity apps so customers can make the most of Salesforce Lightning and Quip along with Gmail, Hangouts Meet, Google Calendar, Drive, Docs and Sheets. It also brings sales, marketing and advertising data across Salesforce Sales Cloud, Salesforce Marketing Cloud and Google Analytics 360 together for better number crunching. There are a number of benefits for Google as well: First, Google’s ability to offer better analytics to retailers competing with Amazon, which uses CRM from Salesforce. Second, Google gets access to those of the 150K Salesforce customers that are new to G Suite, thus expanding its enterprise customer base. (These customers will get a year’s worth of the service free of cost provided they qualify). Third, Salesforce will use Google infrastructure where required as it expands internationally (it only uses AWS now), which can only be positive for Google. Tencent Invests in Snap: Changes are coming to Snapchat, the oh-so-popular teen app from the company that doesn’t have the revenues to show for it. Most of its innovations are copied by Facebook in record time, which quickly rolls them out to its much larger customer base. The truth is, Snap can’t make it big without targeting a bigger audience. So it’s doing a number of things to grow the numbers, both users and engagement. The first is a redesign that will place personal stories on the left and curated content on the right to facilitate discovery. The second is the exploration of new strategies or avenues of growth, possibly through partnerships. The company also disclosed last week that China’s Tencent had bought 145.8 million non-voting shares in the company for an additional 12% stake. It’s likely that Tencent will bring gaming content to the platform. An emailed statement from the company reads thus: “The investment enables Tencent to explore cooperation opportunities with the company on mobile games publishing and newsfeed as well as to share its financial returns from the growth of its businesses and monetization in the future”. Some Numbers iPhone X Teardown: According to an IHS Markit teardown, the stainless steel case, 3-D facial recognition system on the front and 5.8-inch OLED screen of the iPhone X that aren’t part of the iPhone 8 have increased bill of materials for Apple’s flagship device. The cost therefore comes to $370.25 for the 64GB model compared to $255.16 for the iPhone 8 with the same storage. TechInsights, on the other hand, places the cost at $357.50 and given the $999 retail price, estimates the gross margin on the device of 64%. The iPhone 8 in comparison fetches a gross margin of 59%, according to the company. But drop tests (from 6 and 3 feet heights) reveal that the phone is the most breakable and expensive to replace. The corner drop is the least disruptive, but dropping on the front or back face shatters the device, for which Apple will not sell the parts destroys but replace the entire device for $549, which is $150 more than the cost of replacing the iPhone 8 glass. Amazon Discounting Third Party Sellers’ Wares: Moving away from its practice of discounting only those products that it ships directly, Amazon has started discounting products it sells on behalf of third party sellers. If a product is sold on an Amazon discount, the full amount including the discount is paid to the seller by Amazon. The discount is obviously intended to move customers away from competing platforms and traditional retailers like Walmart. But third party sellers may not be thrilled for a number of reasons: discounts that they didn’t plan for might lead to inventory imbalances. Moreover, it could devalue their brands. Amazon says that while the discount is clearly labelled as coming from Amazon, sellers can still opt out at any time. Twitter Doubles Character Count: Twitter has finally doubled the character limit from 140 to 280 so users can express themselves better. All users that is, except those in Japan, Korea and China, because those languages are denser and therefore more expressive, according to the company. Twitter has been testing the increased character limit with a number of users since September and found that most users don’t send very long tweets. On the other hand, the option to say more in a single tweet meant that users generally could think less about the composition, so they could be more spontaneous. They could also probably (or at least more often) do without screen shots of longer messages, or tweet storms (saying what they mean in a series of tweets rather than a single one because of the character limitation). Some older Twitter users are afraid that the character of the platform will change with longer tweets. But the ability to express themselves more fully will definitely attract more users, make it more social and increase engagement on the platform.

Earnings season is drawing to a close with most of the S&P 500 having reported already, making NVIDIA NVDA easily the hottest earnings from last week. The online travel agents continued to disappoint, with both Priceline PCLN and TripAdvisor TRIP shares plummeting. These and Intel’s INTC deal with Advanced Micro Devices AMD were the top stories from last week- Earnings NVIDIA: NVIDIA reported very strong revenue and earnings growth in its fiscal third quarter, easily beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both top and bottom lines. Gaming (driven by strength across geographies and form factors, Nintendo Switch and cryptocurrencies) Data Center (driven by cloud service providers and HPC) and Professional Visualization (driven by VR adoption at defense and automotive customers, stronger demand for high-end real-time rendering, simulation and more powerful mobile workstations) were all up strongly from last year. The guidance indicates that the strength will continue. Priceline: Priceline reported a strong quarter with both top and bottom lines ahead of the respective Zacks Consensus estimates. The company’s hotel revenues did better than its rental cars and flight bookings, both of which saw weaker volumes. While bookings at the start of the current quarter were at the high end of management expectations, so can’t be considered unusually weak, the guidance was disappointing even by Priceline’s standards (it usually guides conservatively). The reason for the weakness, especially on the hotels side isn’t clear but could be because of efforts by hotels to reach customers directly rather than through a distribution channel. TripAdvisor: TripAdvisor reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings on revenues that disappointed. While revenues continued to grow albeit very slowly, earnings dropped over 32% from last year. The hotels side of the business was weak, with other revenues (from attractions, restaurants and vacation rentals) remaining strong. The company burnt cash and saw a reduction in its net cash position. Intel & AMD Finally Have a Deal Everyone expected Intel and Advanced Micro Devices to get closer together after Intel’s forced licensing deal with archrival NVIDIA expired in Jan 2017. But one of the things that stood in the way was the fact that AMD also competed with Intel, on multiple fronts. For AMD, licensing technology to Intel would mean sacrificing profits from chip sales in exchange for royalties from a larger number of chips. It was likely a difficult decision, made easier only by the fact that their combination could help them take share in a market they were both targeting (i.e. high-end gaming laptops), one that is currently dominated by the common enemy NVIDIA. There are also other areas of interest. The first would be the shrinking PC market and Intel’s need to maintain position while investing in emerging areas like AI, cloud, IoT, auto, etc. The second would be AMD’s unattractive financials that would improve with a steady flow of revenues from Intel. Third, AMD’s limited presence in the PC gaming segment (the only part of the PC market that still has attractive growth rates) where its discrete GPUs are up against NVIDIA’s, but where Intel has limited presence because it only sells an integrated version. Marrying AMD graphics with Intel processing power would strengthen the integrated solution versus the discrete one. For those with any doubts about whether the relationship is a short term one or part of a larger-scale alliance between the two, it’s worth noting that AMD VP and chief architect of the Radeon Technologies Group, Raja Koduri is now an Intel employee as its chief architect, SVP of its newly formed Core and Visual Computing Group, and GM of a new initiative to drive edge computing solutions. The actual product details are limited at this point, but Intel has said that this will be part of its 8th Gen Intel Core family, bringing together its high-performing Intel Core H-series processor, second generation High Bandwidth Memory (HBM2) and a custom discrete graphics chip from AMD’s Radeon Technologies Group – all in a single processor package. The integration will be facilitated with Intel’s Embedded Multi-Die Interconnect Bridge (EMIB) that will be used for the first time in a consumer device. The purpose of the integration is to fit in more power and performance with better thermal dissipation and consuming less energy into a smaller form factor.

Apple Supplier Planning India Expansion: Wistron Corp, Apple’s iPhone assembler in India is looking for 100 acres of land in Bangalore and have short-listed a few parcels of land, Bloomberg reports. Apple currently assembles only the SE in India and all the high end models are still imported, so they have an import duty stacked on the already-high prices. Nevertheless, Wistron said that the additional capacity may also be used for customers other than Apple. Raja Koduri Joins Intel: Intel plans to make a mark in the graphics chip business, where it is a secondary player to AMD and NVDIA. So just before NVIDIA reported, the company announced that it had whisked away Raja Koduri, senior vice president and chief architect of the Radeon Technologies Group at AMD to head this effort. Koduri has more than 25 years of experience in graphics hardware, software and system architecture in visual and accelerated computing advances across a broad range of devices, including PCs, game consoles, professional workstations and consumer devices. Davidson Sees Cisco Share Loss: Mark Kelleher of D. A. Davidson is excited about Arista Networks’ stellar results and strong revenue growth rate and thinks it will continue to take market share away from Cisco for years to come. Accordingly, the analyst raised his price target on the shares from $180 to $224 while upgrading the shares from Neutral to Buy. The strong results were despite weaker-than-expected revenues from the top cloud vendors because of a product workaround related to Cisco patents, which therefore extended the qualification with them. Other analysts conceded that the company was growing strongly but also pointed to the rich valuation that kept some of them on the sidelines. Microsoft Buys Chevron Data Center: Just a day after Microsoft signed a 7-year deal to provide cloud computing services (including data analytics and IoT) to the giant energy company Chevron Corp, its subsidiary Chevron USA sold its 5200 Rogers Road data center to Microsoft. While the purchase price was kept under wraps, the Bexar County Appraisal District fixes the value at $80 million. The company’s massive operational scale generates 1TB of data per day, which can be processed to generate operational efficiencies and savings for the company. Tesla Nabs Microsoft Engineer: Microsoft just lost Scott Simms, one of the leading engineers at its video game engineering unit to Tesla as its "Director of UI Engineering." Simms’ LinkedIn profile says that he was involved in "AR & 3D reconstruction on mobile devices.” He also says that he managed computer vision, UI and app teams developing monocular SLAM and 3D reconstruction running real time on resource constrained hardware. Amazon Pop-Ups at Whole Foods Stores: For the holidays, Amazon will be opening pop up stores within 100 Whole Foods outlets in Illinois, Michigan, Florida, California and Colorado so people can try Amazon devices and familiarize themselves with Prime and other subscriptions. Whole Foods is also offering Black Friday deals on Amazon's merchandise, including $20 off the Echo Dot, $20 off the new Amazon Echo, $30 off the new Echo Plus and $30 off the Fire HD 8 tablet. The stores already process Amazon returns and have Amazon lockers for product pickup. The integration is going well and further plans are afoot that might see Prime members getting special deals inside Whole Foods stores. Amazon’s Echo Group of Devices in Japan: Amazon has now introduced Alexa and its Echo group of devices to Japanese customers. Alexa for Japan has been built from the ground up especially for Japanese customers with a new Japanese voice, local knowledge and over 250 skills from Japanese developers. Legal/Regulatory Israeli Startup Claims Apple Infringed Its Tech: Tel Aviv-based Corephotonics, which has raised $50 million from several high-profile venture capital firms and other investors, has filed a patent infringement case against Apple. The company claims that Apple had used its patented dual camera technology in its Phone 7 Plus and iPhone 8 Plus without authorization. According to the filed complaint, "Apple’s lead negotiator expressed contempt for Corephotonics’ patents, telling [CEO] Dr. Mendlovic and others that even if Apple infringed, it would take years and millions of dollars in litigation before Apple might have to pay something." Samsung Ventures, Apple supplier Foxconn and chipmaker MediaTek are investors in Corephotonics through its latest funding round in January. Other investors include Magma VC, Amiti Ventures, Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing and Solina Chau’s Horizon Ventures, flash storage maker SanDisk and Chinese telephone services provider CK Telecom. Waymo-Uber Lawsuit Update: U.S. District Judge William Alsup, in an order the details of which were kept secret to allow both sides an opportunity to review his reasoning privately, has dealt a big blow to Alphabet’s Waymo in its case against Uber. The case was about the theft of intellectual property by one Anthony Levandowski, who stole files and transferred the information to his self-driving trucking company called Otto Trucking that was soon acquired by Uber. The ruling is a blow on two counts; the first being the disqualification of Waymo’s damages expert/striking out of the report on which he is relying (it’s hard to tell which or both from media reports currently available) and the second, the removal of Otto as a joint defendant in the case. Without the expert, it could be harder for Waymo to prove why it deserves a billion dollars in damages on a case involving technology that hasn’t yet come to market. Without Otto in the picture, it will be harder for Waymo to fix responsibility on Uber, since the technology moved through Otto to Uber. New Products/Technology Apple AR Glasses: Bloomberg says that according to people familiar with the matter, Apple will have an AR headset powered by a new chip and with its own display and operating system ready to ship by 2019. Apple is moving aggressively, according to the people although the deadline could still get pushed back. CEO Tim Cook who is extremely positive about the technology, has said that he already sees how AR will “transform the way you work, play, connect and learn” and the way that’s it’s going to “change the way we use technology forever.” Housing Rentals Come to Facebook Marketplace: Facebook is partnering with companies like Apartment List and Zumper, which are in turn working with brokers, agents and property managers to greatly expand the list of housing rentals on the platform. Users looking for suitable homes will be able to filter results based on location, price, rental type, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, square footage, pet-friendliness and other criteria. Users can also put up their own listings directly to the site using 360 degree images. Google Files Go: Google is working on a new app called Files Go to be available as a part of the stock Android version, for file management, sharing and cleaning. Sharing files on Android devices is possible, if not too comfortable today. So both users have to have the concerned app open and have to tap their phones together to make the connection via NFC. It’s awkward and not very well known among users. Files Go will likely solve this problem. Additionally, it will also help to clean up disk space. The app has a dashboard that shows how much storage your phone has left, a button to clear cached files, and suggestions to remove large files that you’re apparently not using any more, all with the goal of freeing up space. There’s also a files manager that lets you browse through local photos, videos, music and other documents. Amazon Fire TV Stick Across 100 Regions: Amazon has launched the basic version of its Fire TV stick in over 100 more countries, so people can simply plug the device into the HDMI port of their HDTVs to stream the latest shows, Amazon Prime content and also play games. Customers can also set their default language as Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, French, Italian, German or English. Collaborations and M&A Apple Acquired InVisage: Apple has acquired an image technology company that raised $98 million from various sources including Nokia and Intel Capital. The reason these companies were interested in InVisage is a technology called QuantumFilm that appears to be a breakthrough in materials science. This specialized device works with dedicated software to deliver highly accurate images in a very small form factor and even in low light conditions. Considering the way technology is developing, image processing is a super-important market with scope for application in not only smartphones and computing devices, but also IoT, security, automotive, AR/VR, filming and others. This is likely to be an important piece of technology for Apple, but one that we won’t know much more about because of the size of the acquisition that makes it immaterial to Apple’s operations, which therefore doesn’t carry a statutory requirement to disclose. Microsoft-Ola: Microsoft has signed an important alliance with Ola Cabs of India that will see the ride-hailing service transfer automotive data to Microsoft’s Azure instead of Amazon’s AWS and integrate Microsoft’s artificial intelligence and productivity tools into Ola Play (the company's existing connected car platform). This appears to be a step toward Ola’s self-driving car goals and furthers Microsoft’s objective of wresting corporate customers from AWS. In the meantime, it also enables improved in-car productivity (users get Office 365 and Skype for Business, as well as voice-assisted controls built using Microsoft Cognitive Services and Bot framework, in-car during their rides), vehicle diagnostics,  advanced navigation and predictive maintenance of vehicles. Ola recently raised around a $1 billion in a funding round that included Tencent and Japan’s Softbank. Google, Salesforce Get Cozier: Google and Salesforce are integrating their software so their solutions are more complete, useful and competitive versus offerings from Microsoft Azure. Of course Salesforce also integrates with AWS, the other major Azure (and Google Cloud) competitor. In Google’s case, the partnership involves Salesforce CRM working closer together with Google G Suite productivity apps so customers can make the most of Salesforce Lightning and Quip along with Gmail, Hangouts Meet, Google Calendar, Drive, Docs and Sheets. It also brings sales, marketing and advertising data across Salesforce Sales Cloud, Salesforce Marketing Cloud and Google Analytics 360 together for better number crunching. There are a number of benefits for Google as well: First, Google’s ability to offer better analytics to retailers competing with Amazon, which uses CRM from Salesforce. Second, Google gets access to those of the 150K Salesforce customers that are new to G Suite, thus expanding its enterprise customer base. (These customers will get a year’s worth of the service free of cost provided they qualify). Third, Salesforce will use Google infrastructure where required as it expands internationally (it only uses AWS now), which can only be positive for Google. Tencent Invests in Snap: Changes are coming to Snapchat, the oh-so-popular teen app from the company that doesn’t have the revenues to show for it. Most of its innovations are copied by Facebook in record time, which quickly rolls them out to its much larger customer base. The truth is, Snap can’t make it big without targeting a bigger audience. So it’s doing a number of things to grow the numbers, both users and engagement. The first is a redesign that will place personal stories on the left and curated content on the right to facilitate discovery. The second is the exploration of new strategies or avenues of growth, possibly through partnerships. The company also disclosed last week that China’s Tencent had bought 145.8 million non-voting shares in the company for an additional 12% stake. It’s likely that Tencent will bring gaming content to the platform. An emailed statement from the company reads thus: “The investment enables Tencent to explore cooperation opportunities with the company on mobile games publishing and newsfeed as well as to share its financial returns from the growth of its businesses and monetization in the future”. Some Numbers iPhone X Teardown: According to an IHS Markit teardown, the stainless steel case, 3-D facial recognition system on the front and 5.8-inch OLED screen of the iPhone X that aren’t part of the iPhone 8 have increased bill of materials for Apple’s flagship device. The cost therefore comes to $370.25 for the 64GB model compared to $255.16 for the iPhone 8 with the same storage. TechInsights, on the other hand, places the cost at $357.50 and given the $999 retail price, estimates the gross margin on the device of 64%. The iPhone 8 in comparison fetches a gross margin of 59%, according to the company. But drop tests (from 6 and 3 feet heights) reveal that the phone is the most breakable and expensive to replace. The corner drop is the least disruptive, but dropping on the front or back face shatters the device, for which Apple will not sell the parts destroys but replace the entire device for $549, which is $150 more than the cost of replacing the iPhone 8 glass. Amazon Discounting Third Party Sellers’ Wares: Moving away from its practice of discounting only those products that it ships directly, Amazon has started discounting products it sells on behalf of third party sellers. If a product is sold on an Amazon discount, the full amount including the discount is paid to the seller by Amazon. The discount is obviously intended to move customers away from competing platforms and traditional retailers like Walmart. But third party sellers may not be thrilled for a number of reasons: discounts that they didn’t plan for might lead to inventory imbalances. Moreover, it could devalue their brands. Amazon says that while the discount is clearly labelled as coming from Amazon, sellers can still opt out at any time. Twitter Doubles Character Count: Twitter has finally doubled the character limit from 140 to 280 so users can express themselves better. All users that is, except those in Japan, Korea and China, because those languages are denser and therefore more expressive, according to the company. Twitter has been testing the increased character limit with a number of users since September and found that most users don’t send very long tweets. On the other hand, the option to say more in a single tweet meant that users generally could think less about the composition, so they could be more spontaneous. They could also probably (or at least more often) do without screen shots of longer messages, or tweet storms (saying what they mean in a series of tweets rather than a single one because of the character limitation). Some older Twitter users are afraid that the character of the platform will change with longer tweets. But the ability to express themselves more fully will definitely attract more users, make it more social and increase engagement on the platform.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apos-why-time-buy-nvidia-130801855.html

A successful investor understands the importance of adding well-performing stocks to the portfolio at the right time. NVIDIA Corporation NVDA is one such technology stock that has been on a healthy growth trajectory of late. Shares of this California-based graphic chip behemoth have rallied nearly 5% since its reported solid third-quarter fiscal 2018 results. Moreover, the stock has been clocking solid returns in the last year and has soared 158.4%, outperforming the industry's gain of 60.3% over the same period. The stock has an estimated long-term earnings growth rate of 11.2%. With solid prospects, this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock is an attractive pick at the moment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Stellar Performance in Q3 NVIDIA posted earnings of $1.33 per share on non-GAAP basis, up nearly 60.2% year over year. Non-GAAP earnings also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 94 cents per share. The year-over-year rise in the bottom line mainly stemmed from significant revenue growth along with gross margin and operating margin expansion. Revenues surged 31.5% year over year to $2.636 billion.  The figure also comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.364 billion as well as management’s projection of $2.35 billion (+/-2%). The year-over-year jump is primarily attributable to growth across all the platforms — the GPUs gaming platform, Professional Visualization, datacenter and Tegra automotive platforms. Further, NVIDIA continued to gain strength in the artificial intelligence (AI) space, which positively impacted the quarter’s revenues. Raised Guidance For fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, NVIDIA expects revenues of approximately $2.65 billion (+/-2%), which is much higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.44 billion. For fiscal 2018, the company continues to expect returning $1.25 billion to its shareholders in the form of cash dividends and share repurchases. Estimates Northbound Estimates for NVIDIA have moved up in the past seven days, reflecting the optimistic outlook of analysts. Earnings estimates for the current quarter have jumped 5.1% while that of next quarter moved up 3.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is $2.44 billion for current quarter, displaying 12.3% year-over-year growth. Revenues for fiscal 2018 are estimated to be $8.99 billion, reflecting 30% annual growth. For the current quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.03, depicting year-over-year growth of 3.5% while that for fiscal 2018 of $3.66 displays a rise of 42.6%. Positive Earnings Surprise History NVIDIA has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, delivering a positive average earnings surprise of 33.5%. Growth Drivers The company’s sustained focus on introducing fast and innovative products as well as agreements with leading PC game makers have been driving its Gaming GPU business. During the quarter, NVIDIA announced the launch of the new high end graphic card, GeForce GTX 1070 1070 Ti. Available from Nov 2, the card was released to take down AMD’s $400 Radeon Vega 56. We believe this will take the gaming experience to a new level. Hence, the launch of this product will enable NVIDIA to increase its customer base and help in garnering additional revenues. NVIDIA also collaborated with Square Enix to unveil Final Fantasy XV Windows Edition for PC in Gamescom 2017, which is aimed at bringing an enhanced gaming experience to PCs. This deal is a positive for NVIDIA, as it will help the company gain market share among gaming content developers.  Moreover, it joined forces with Activision to bring Destiny 2 online game to the PC for the first time. The company’s Volta-based V100 accelerator was the most notable launch of late. The Volta V100 GPU provides 10 times more deep learning power to the company’s year-old predecessor, Pascal generation GPUs. Recently, Alibaba, Baidu BIDU and Tencent announced that they are adopting NVIDIA Volta GPUs in their datacenters and cloud server, joining Amazon, Facebook, Alphabet’s GOOGL Google and Microsoft MSFT. Demand for NVIDIA’s HGX AI supercomputer also remained high as more organizations are keen on building AI-enabled applications. The company stated that Huawei, Inspur and Lenovo will be using its Volta HGX architecture to build AI systems for datacenters. During the quarter, NVIDIA launched TensorRT programmable inference acceleration platform, thereby improving the performance and reducing the cost of AI inferencing. Notably, more than 1,200 companies are already using this inference platform, including Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, Google, Alibaba, Baidu, Hi Vision and Tencent. The company also unveiled a new AI supercomputer chip designed for self-driving cars called Pegasus at its GPU Technology Conference in Europe. This new technology helps to drive fully autonomous robotaxis which can handle the concept of Level 5 self-driving vehicles and uses NVIDIA’s DRIVE PX 2 platform, trained on deep neural networks. Per the company, the new system is capable of delivering 320 trillion operations per second of performance, which is more than 10 times compared with its predecessor. To Conclude We expect these factors to help the company sustain strong momentum and stay afloat amid difficult times. Consequently, we suggest that investors buy the stock for the time being. Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?  Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge. With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research. It's not the one you think.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/surprise-coming-nvidia-nvda-earnings-134001006.html

Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and NVIDIA Corporation NVDA may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report. That is because NVIDIA is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for NVDA in this report. In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 95 cents per share for NVDA, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 94 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for NVDA, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.71% heading into earnings season.

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) unveiled its latest quarterly earnings results after the bell Thursday. The company posted profit of $1.33 per share, which handily topped Wall Street’s consensus estimate of 95 cents per share, according to data compiled by FactSet. Revenue came in at $2.64 billion, topping analysts’ expectations of $2.37 billion and growing 32% year-over-year. On the gaming front, Nvidia saw revenue pop 25% year-over-year to $1.56 billion, making up more than half of the company’s total revenue. Data center chips rose considerably, increasing 109% to $500 million. The company’s revenue was also aided by its data center business, which saw its revenue skyrocket 175% year-over-year. There was a higher demand from large-scale customers working on artificial intelligence, according to Nvidia. The demand for the company’s graphics chips linked to cryptocurrencies also soared as the price for bitcoin and ethereum have continued to gain traction. Nvidia also said it will increase its dividend from 14 cents to 15 cents per share. The company had been leasing the land for its new headquarters in Santa Clara, California, and it announced that it was now buying the land for about $350 million. Its previous headquarters were in Wachovia. “We had a great quarter across all of our growth drivers,” said CEO Jensen Huang in a statement during the company’s press release. “Industries across the world are accelerating their adoption of AI,” he added at the earnings call. NVDA stock surged 2.6% after the bell Thursday. Article printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2017/11/nvidia-corporation-nvda/. ©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC

Nvidia (NVDA) is scheduled to report third quarter fiscal 2017 earnings results after Thursday’s closing bell. For the three months that ended October, Wall Street expects the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company to earn 94 cents per share, up 13% year-over-year, on revenue of $2.36 billion, up 18% year over year. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings were 83 cents per share on revenue of $2.00 billion. For the full year, ending in December, earnings of $3.63 per share would rise about 41%, while full-year revenue of $8.97 billion would rise 30% year over year. With its shares skyrocketing almost 100% year-to-date and well-perched above $200 per share, the semiconductor giant has high expectations to live up to and its own big shoes to fill. But thanks to successes in high-growth markets like artificial intelligence (AI), where Nvidia chips are at the center of autonomous driving technology, the company has posted breathtaking top- and bottom-line growth results, which has crushed Wall Street's estimates the past two years. In the second quarter, Nvidia made a case for why it belongs in the FANG category by crushing Q2 profit estimates by 31 cents as earnings per share grew by a whopping 124% year over year. Just as impressive, revenue growth surged 56% to $2.23 billion, topping the consensus estimates of $1.96 billion, driven by a 52% rise in gaming revenue. The company is also showing more balance and diversification as the datacenter business — the company’s second-largest target market platform by revenue — surged 175%. Will there be any slowdown this quarter? Obviously, triple-digit revenue growth can’t go on forever. But will any growth deceleration be enough to incite investors fear? Earlier this week, Craig Ellis analyst at B. Riley FBR reiterated his Buy rating on Nvidia stock and raised his 12-month price target to $250 from $200, suggesting 20% rise from current levels. This upgrade followed a similar bullish assessment from Jefferies semiconductor analyst Mark Lipacis, who last month reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and upped his 12-month price target from $180 to $230. Lipacis cited Nvidia’s AI chip, which he described as a key catalyst for “upside surprises over the next 18-24 months.” Elsewhere the strength of cryptocurrencies and the crypto-mining crave it has created. To which Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh last month argued that NVDA shares will continue to benefit from “strong underlying trends in cryptocurrency and gaming,” which he notes are ahead of the company’s expectations. “We believe NVDA continues to see strong GPU [graphics processing unit] trends in cryptocurrency and gaming. GPU pricing remains up post-launch (of its new graphics chip) given shortage and strong demand,” Rakesh wrote in a note to investors. All told, you would be hard-pressed to find a stronger-executing company today than Nvidia, which despite increased competitive pressures from Intel (INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), the company is seemingly operating on all cylinders. While these shares are screaming bargains today, I’m not holding my breath waiting for them to become cheap — not with such strong winds in Nvidia’s sails.

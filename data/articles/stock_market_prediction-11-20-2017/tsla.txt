TSLA – If Elon Musk’s new semi truck gains widespread adoption, oil demand could take a major hit. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) finally unveiled its electric semi truck last week to much fanfare. Ever the showman, CEO Elon Musk pulled up to the event in a gleaming silver big rig, hopping out and immediately making his sales pitch. “It blows my mind and I think it’ll blow yours,” he said. Musk stressed the truck’s incredible acceleration performance along with its 500 mile range as its key features — not to mention the fact that it’s much more environmentally friendly than current semis on the road. As Bloomberg notes, if the company can solve its production woes and actually deliver large numbers of the vehicles to customers within the next few years, it could have a major impact on oil demand:  If he can equal the manufacturing prowess of Apple Inc.’s current Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook, he might just clobber the oil industry too. That’s a big if, given Tesla’s current inability to meet manufacturing targets on the mass-market Model 3 electric car. But if the company really can deliver a battery-powered big rig with a 500-mile range and lower lifetime costs than diesel vehicles, then a big chunk of future oil demand growth is in peril. Road freight — dominated by diesel — accounts for around 20% of the world’s total oil consumption. Meanwhile, trucks account for around 60% of the global diesel demand growth since the year 2000, according to the latest World Energy Outlook published by the International Energy Agency. If Tesla can capture even a decent chunk of the market, it’ll cut down on those numbers substantially. Its competitors will also have to scramble to adopt as well, which means even more electric semis on the road. All of that adds up to much less diesel consumption in coming years, which should be music to just about everyone’s ears outside of the oil industry. Tesla Inc shares fell $0.55 (-0.17%) in premarket trading Monday. Year-to-date, TSLA has gained 47.43%, versus a 17.00% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period. TSLA currently has a StockNews.com POWR Rating of C (Neutral), and is ranked #16 of 24 stocks in the Auto & Vehicle Manufacturers category.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) revealed Thursday yet another project in its ever-expanding portfolio. Behind the scenes, even as it worked out Model 3 production kinks, directed resources to Puerto Rican solar projects and delayed its Semi reveal, Tesla had secretly revived the Roadster, its first electric vehicle. What You Need To Know: With a top speed above 250 miles per hour, the Roadster base model goes zero-to-60 in 1.9 seconds and zero-to-100 in 4.2 seconds. One charge of its 200 kilowatt-per-hour battery sustains a 630-mile trek. “The point of doing this is just to give a hardcore smackdown to gasoline cars,” CEO Elon Musk said. “Driving a gasoline sports car is going to feel like a steam engine with a side of quiche.” The four-seater includes three motors, torque steering and all-wheel drive. Musk plans to begin production in 2019 for 2020 sales at $200,000 per unit, except for the first 1,000 limited editions priced at $250,000. What Analysts Think: The new Roadster could capture 25 percent of the exotic car market and bring in nearly $1 billion per year, according to Loup Ventures managing partner Gene Munster. But that’s not necessarily the point. “Musk’s comment that the point of building the Roadster was to ‘give a hardcore smackdown to gasoline cars’ highlights the fact that Roadster is more about making a statement to the industry around the performance of EVs [...] and less about making money,” Munster wrote in a Friday note. Others on the Street interpreted the unveiling with marked concern. “We can't help worrying that Tesla may be taking on too much organizationally – which could distract it from ensuring Model 3's commercial success, which we believe is the critical driver of the company's fortunes,” Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi Jr. wrote in a Friday note. Munster anticipates potential delays leading to a 2021 rollout. The Stock’s Reaction: Tesla’s stock had been on the rise all week as Musk teased the new Semi. At time of publication, shares were up 3 percent at $321.71.

Elon Musk at Nasdaq MarketSite Yesterday, Tesla (TSLA) unveiled its new truck, and the event was vintage Musk. As if the world’s first fully electric semi wasn’t enough, he used the occasion to unveil a new roadster that was driven from the trailer used in the demo. That kind of showmanship and marketing has been his genius in the past. It has helped to cement his reputation as an innovative, disruptive thinker and it keeps the Tesla fans in awe. The haters, of course, see it all as a distraction from the production issues and increasing losses at the company, but you either buy into the visionary thing or you don’t. Even for the doubters, though, the numbers make it hard to be anything but impressed with the truck itself. Tesla claim it will make truck operation cheaper and safer, and given the relative cost of electricity and the inclusion of autopilot features such as automatic braking and lane departure correction, both of those claims look justified. Probably the most impressive numbers, though, are the single charge range of 500 miles, and the 400 miles achievable after thirty minutes on a Tesla Supercharger. It will also lumber less from a stop than diesel vehicles, reaching 60 MPH in 20 seconds fully laden and in an incredible 5 seconds without a trailer. What we don’t know at this point is how much it will cost. The lack of that information is understandable, as predicting cost for a vehicle scheduled for production in two years would be tough in any case, and is even more so when that vehicle is battery powered. The cost of batteries is falling rapidly as production levels increase, and it is impossible to predict where we will be in two years. It is, however, reasonable to assume that prices will be significantly lower, enabling the Tesla truck to be competitively priced. There are, however, questions that remain for investors, even those that are not about to buy TSLA regardless of the truck and roadster. An affordable, practical electric semi has obvious implications for the oil business and prices of the commodity, as well as for things like natural gas and solar power that are increasingly used to generate electricity. But, there is also a bigger issue: jobs. According to the American Trucking Association there are 3.5 million professional truck drivers in the U.S., and Goldman Sachs economists have estimated that 300,000 of those jobs will be eliminated annually as automation takes hold.  As for Tesla stock, this can only be seen as a positive. There are, of course, other companies involved in research into electric trucks, but none have either the experience or the cachet of Tesla in the field. Add in the prospect of a return to Tesla’s roots in performance electric vehicles with the roadster and it is no wonder that the stock is up around four percent in this morning’s pre-market. Even if you see yesterday’s revelations as a distraction, the fact remains that the losses now look more like massive investment in the future. That will renew the excitement of the Tesla faithful and ensure that this morning’s jump is just the beginning.

Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) has became attention seeker from the inquisitor when it experienced a change of 0.82% Whereas, in last 21 trading days was -10.45% and moved up in last 63 trading days of -6.75%. Looking further out we can see that the stock has moved 47.43% over the year to date. Along with these its last twelve month performance is stands at 66.99% while moved 1.51% for the past six months according to Finviz reported data. Every trader dreams of taking a small amount of capital and becoming a millionaire off of it. The reality is that it is unlikely to occur by trading a small account. While profits can accumulate and compound over time, traders with small accounts often feel pressured to use large amounts of leverage or take on excessive risk in order to build up their accounts quickly. Not realizing that professional fund managers often make less than 10-15% per year, traders with small accounts often assume they can make double, triple or even 10 times their money in a single year. A strategy doesn’t need to win all the time to be profitable. Many traders only win 50% to 60% of their trades. The point is, they make more on their winners than they lose on their losers. Make sure that the risk on each trade is limited to a specific percentage of the account, and that entry and exit methods are clearly defined and written down. There are times when the stock markets test your nerves. As a day trader you need to learn to keep greed, hope and fear at bay. Decisions should be governed by logic and not emotion. One strategy is to set two stop losses: Analytical Significance of Simple Moving Average The SMA200 of the stock is at -2.05%, SMA20 is -0.58%, while SMA50 is -7.52%. TSLA’s relative volume was 2.39. Relative volume is a great indicator to keep a close eye on, but like most indicators it works best in conjunction with other indicators and on different time frames. Higher relative volume you will have more liquidity in the stock which will tighten spreads and allow you to trade with more size without a ton of slippage. TSLA’s overall volume in the last trading session was 13,718,423 shares. Important Technical Indicators to keep in Focus:- A statistical measure of the dispersion of returns (volatility) for TSLA producing salvation in Investors mouth, it has week volatility of 3.83% and for the month booked as 3.23%. Regardless of which metric you utilize, a firm understanding of the concept of volatility and how it is measured is essential to successful investing. A stock that maintains a relatively stable price has low volatility. When investing in a volatile security, the risk of success is increased just as much as the risk of failure.  Tesla, Inc.’s beta is 1.01 whilst the stock has an average true range (ATR) of 10.14. Other technical indicators are worth considering in assessing the prospects for EQT. RSI for instance is currently at 43.48. It is common practice for investors to use the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio or price multiple) to determine if a company’s stock price is over or undervalued. Companies with a high P/E ratio are typically growth stocks. However, their relatively high multiples do not necessarily mean their stocks are overpriced and not good buys for the long term. The PEG ratio shows us that, when compare to the beer company, the always-popular tech company doesn’t have the growth rate to justify its higher P/E, and its stock price appears overvalued. Tesla, Inc.’s currently has a PEG ratio of – where as its P/E ratio is 0.00. The company P/S (price to Sales) ratio is 4.88, P/B (price to Book) ratio is 11.19, while its P/C (price to Cash) ratio stands at 14.88. Should You Go With High Insider Ownership? Many value investors look for stocks with a high percent of insider ownership, under the theory that when management are shareholders, they will act in its own self interest, and create shareholder value in the long-term. This aligns the interests of shareholders with management, thus benefiting everyone. While this sounds great in theory, high insider ownership can actually lead to the opposite result, a management team that is unaccountable because they can keep their jobs under almost any circumstance. Currently Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s shares owned by insiders are 0.10%, whereas shares owned by institutional owners are 59.70%. November 20, 2017 November 20, 2017 November 20, 2017

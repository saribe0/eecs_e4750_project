Every trader dreams of taking a small amount of capital and becoming a millionaire off of it. The reality is that it is unlikely to occur by trading a small account. While profits can accumulate and compound over time, traders with small accounts often feel pressured to use large amounts of leverage or take on excessive risk in order to build up their accounts quickly. Not realizing that professional fund managers often make less than 10-15% per year, traders with small accounts often assume they can make double, triple or even 10 times their money in a single year. A strategy doesn’t need to win all the time to be profitable. Many traders only win 50% to 60% of their trades. The point is, they make more on their winners than they lose on their losers. Make sure that the risk on each trade is limited to a specific percentage of the account, and that entry and exit methods are clearly defined and written down. There are times when the stock markets test your nerves. As a day trader you need to learn to keep greed, hope and fear at bay. Decisions should be governed by logic and not emotion.

WMT’s overall volume in the last trading session was 23,542,016 shares. Important Technical Indicators to keep in Focus:- A statistical measure of the dispersion of returns (volatility) for WMT producing salvation in Investors mouth, it has week volatility of 2.52% and for the month booked as 1.65%. Regardless of which metric you utilize, a firm understanding of the concept of volatility and how it is measured is essential to successful investing.

It is common practice for investors to use the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio or price multiple) to determine if a company’s stock price is over or undervalued. Companies with a high P/E ratio are typically growth stocks. However, their relatively high multiples do not necessarily mean their stocks are overpriced and not good buys for the long term. The PEG ratio shows us that, when compare to the beer company, the always-popular tech company doesn’t have the growth rate to justify its higher P/E, and its stock price appears overvalued.

Many value investors look for stocks with a high percent of insider ownership, under the theory that when management are shareholders, they will act in its own self interest, and create shareholder value in the long-term. This aligns the interests of shareholders with management, thus benefiting everyone. While this sounds great in theory, high insider ownership can actually lead to the opposite result, a management team that is unaccountable because they can keep their jobs under almost any circumstance. Currently Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT)’s shares owned by insiders are 0.80%, whereas shares owned by institutional owners are 30.90%. November 20, 2017 November 20, 2017 November 20, 2017

Source: Shutterstock Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT) are often thrown together in the same all-in-one, discount retailer box, but TGT stock is its own animal. Target skews towards a higher-income demographic, while Walmart skews towards a lower-income demographic, but aside from that, the two are often viewed by consumers as largely one in the same. That was the case on Wall Street. Not so much anymore. TGT stock and WMT have more or less mirrored each other for the past decade. As one goes up, the other goes up. As one goes down, the other goes down. That decade-long trend has broken in a big way recently. WMT stock has surged 40% higher this year, while TGT stock has fallen more than 20%. The drastic difference in performance of these two stocks is telling us that not only is WMT kicking TGT’s butt, but that this butt-kicking will last into the foreseeable future. I don’t buy that thesis. WMT is doing a lot better right now, mostly due robust digital growth, but TGT won’t be left in the dust forever. These two are interlocked in a decades-long competition wherein one wins and losses are exchanged with equal frequency. Just look back at 2014-15. TGT stock was surging while WMT was dropping. Now, the tide has turned. With time, it will turn again. That makes buying TGT stock here and now during its massive underperformance seem like the smart move. The biggest risk hanging over TGT stock is the death of brick-and-mortar retail. But that death simply isn’t happening. The retail landscape is changing thanks to e-commerce and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). But brick-and-mortar retail isn’t dying and being eaten alive entirely by Amazon. It is just shrinking. That shrinking may be close to over. Look no further than the slew of positive retail earnings numbers we have received from retailers recently.

U.S. stock futures are trending lower heading into the open, putting weekly gains in jeopardy for the major market indices. Yesterday’s elation that the Republican tax plan passed the House quickly faded after news broke in the Trump-Russia collusion investigation. Specifically, Special Counsel Robert Mueller subpoenaed Russia-related documents from more than a dozen officials from Donald Trump’s campaign last month. As a result, Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are down 0.07% heading into the open, followed by S&P 500 futures with a loss of 0.02%. Nasdaq-100 futures, meanwhile, are up 0.09%. On the options front, volume was brisk and bullish on Thursday, as about 17.7 million calls and 14.7 million puts changed hands. On the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio retreated to 0.64, while the 10-day moving average held at 0.65. Turning to Thursday’s options activity, Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT) was a hotbed of speculation after the company beat third-quarter forecasts and issued upbeat holiday guidance. Meanwhile, AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) drew bullish speculation in its continued quest to acquire Time Warner Inc (NYSE:TWX), and Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) drew buyers amid a technical breakout.  WMT stock surged more than 10% on Thursday, as traders responded to better-than-expected quarterly earnings and a strong holiday-quarter outlook. Walmart said it earned $1 per share in the quarter, as revenue rose to $123.18 billion. Analysts were expecting earnings of just 97 cents per share on revenue of $121.05 billion. E-commerce was the main highlight, however, gaining 50% year-over-year. Looking ahead, Walmart said it expects full-year earnings of $4.38 to $4.46 per share, up from a prior view of $4.30 to $4.40 per share. Options volume spiked on WMT stock following the report, with the more than 320,000 contracts traded amounting to more than seven times WMT’s daily average. Calls were the option of choice, making up 66% of the day’s take. December options reveal a lingering pessimism for WMT, however. The December put/call open interest ratio currently rests at 0.82. This reading has trended lower in the past week, though, hinting that sentiment is shifting bullish on WMT.

Technical analysts also use volume to predict trends. The current trading volume of 23.54 sits 161.56% higher than the past 3 month’s readings, indicating near-term traders have been more active toward WMT than usual of late. The company trades on average around 900000 shares per market session. Major moves in volume can signal unusual activity, such as insider trading. Unusual volume can be a major signal that investment gurus and momentum traders are piling into a stock ahead of a catalyst. These types of traders like to get in well ahead of a large spike, so it’s always a smart move to monitor unusual volume. In terms of relative volume, these shares are trading at 2.62x their normal volume.

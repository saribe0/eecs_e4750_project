AAPL – India wants a good proposal from Apple soon to build a massive manufacturing hub in the emerging market. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been pushing hard to set up a manufacturing hub in India for years, and it appears that those efforts are getting closer to fruition. As India’s Economic Times reports, the country’s Commerce and Industry Minister Suresh Prabhu said recently that he will support the iPhone maker in its efforts, and is looking forward to a formal proposal soon: “Let us get a good proposal from them…We will be very happy to receive Apple, one of the top brands in the world. We are willing to find out if there is any difficulty they may face. We will be more than happy to resolve that difficulty. So we will await a formal proposal,” Prabhu told PTI in an interview.  He also said that the Centre is willing to call all state chief ministers who are willing to give them the best deal.  The Cupertino-based iPhone and iPad manufacturer Apple has asked for certain concessions for setting up manufacturing unit in the country. In turn, India has asked for several concessions of its own. Any deal it gives Apple, it will have to extend to other companies like chief rival Samsung as well, so the nation wants to ensure it gets a good deal the first time around. It’s unclear how well the negotiations have progressed since March, when sources within India indicated the two entities were still very far apart in their demands. But today’s news is certainly a welcome bit of information, with the Commerce and Industry Minister publicly requesting a formal proposal from Apple. Apple Inc. shares rose $0.20 (+0.11%) in premarket trading Monday. Year-to-date, AAPL has gained 53.50%, versus a 18.14% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period. AAPL currently has a StockNews.com POWR Rating of A (Strong Buy), and is ranked #1 of 28 stocks in the Technology – Hardware category.

Source: Shutterstock While the shine may have worn off Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in the eyes of the general public, MSFT stock remains one of the steadiest performers in the investment world. This, despite that fact that is doesn’t get the same press as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), isn’t a Wall Street darling like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) or Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB), and that its best days are most certainly behind it. In fact, MSFT has been a better stock than many of its more-publicized contemporaries in the tech world. This includes Apple, the company that more than a decade ago essentially replaced Microsoft as Wall Street’s top dog. To wit: In the last two years, MSFT stock has risen 50%; AAPL is up 45%. Going back even further, in the last five years Microsoft stock has ballooned more than 200%; AAPL stock is up 127%. Meanwhile, MSFT pays a higher dividend (2% yield) than AAPL (1.5% yield), grew earnings (13%) faster than Apple (11%) in the most recent quarter, and has nearly double the cash in its coffers, with about 18% less debt. All of this isn’t to put down AAPL stock. After all, 45% growth in two years is hardly worthy of mocking. It is merely to point out that MSFT stock, which endured a big sell-off after the recession, and which attracts just a fraction of the front page headlines as AAPL, is in the midst of a quiet resurgence. There’s been nothing particularly flashy about Microsoft’s comeback. The company’s sales have improved in seven of the last eight years, but never by more than 11%. Profit growth has been consistently in double digits of late. In both cases, Microsoft’s top- and bottom-line growth is either accelerating or holding steady, at a time when Apple’s sales have plummeted from better than 60% growth in 2011 to a mere 19% expected growth in its current fiscal year.

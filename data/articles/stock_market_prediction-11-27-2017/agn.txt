Shares of Allergan plc (NYSE:AGN) observed rebound of 2.31% since bottoming out on Nov. 13, 2017. Meanwhile, due to an ongoing pressure which caused a decline of almost -0.73% in the past five days, the stock price is now down -17.37% so far on the year — still in weak territory. In this case, shares are down -32.43% , the 52-week high touched on Jul. 25, 2017, but are collecting gains at -10.13% for the past 12 months.  Brokerage houses, on average, are recommending investors to hold Allergan plc (AGN)’s shares projecting a $230.89 target price. Analysts‟ target price forecasts are a prediction of a stock‟s future price, generally over the 12 months following the release date (Asquith et al., 2005). This forecast is a point estimate that provides investors with a benchmark against which to directly compare stock price in the short run.Target prices made by analysts employed by large brokers, who have access to a greater resource pool, are more likely to be met over the 12-month forecast period.  AGN’s revenue has grown at an average annualized rate of about 26% during the past five years. However, the company’s most recent quarter increase of 11.4% looks attractive. The sales growth rate for a stock is a measure of how the stock’s sales per share (SPS) has grown over a specific period of time. It tells an investor how quickly a company is increasing its revenues. The sales growth rate helps investors determine how strong the overall growth-orientation is for a stock or portfolio.   The best measure of a company is its profitability, for without it, it cannot grow, and if it doesn’t grow, then its stock will trend downward. Increasing profits are the best indication that a company can pay dividends and that the share price will trend upward. Creditors will loan money at a cheaper rate to a profitable company than to an unprofitable one; consequently, profitable companies can use leverage to increase stockholders’ equity even more. Profitability ratios compare different accounts to see how efficiently a business is generating profits. These ratios show how well income is generated through operations, and are important to both creditors and investors. They help determine the company’s ability to continue operating. Currently, Allergan plc net profit margin for the 12 months is at -46.93%. Comparatively, the peers have a net margin 11.27%, and the sector’s average is 5.28%. In that light, it seems in weak position compared to its peers and sector. The profit margin measures the amount of net income earned with each dollar’s worth of revenue. It shows the percentage of sales that remain after all of the company’s expenses have been paid. The higher the ratio, the better.  Kellogg Company (NYSE:K) is another stock that is grabbing investors attention these days. Its shares have trimmed -15.33% since hitting a peak level on Feb. 09, 2017. Thanks to an increase of almost 7.36% in the past one month, the stock price is now with underperforming -11.91% so far on the year — still in weak zone. In this case, shares are 10.5% higher, the worst price in 52 weeks suffered on Oct. 30, 2017, but are collecting gains at -10.59% for the past six months.  The good news is there’s still room for Kellogg Company (K) to grow. At recent closing price of $64.93, K has a chance to add $5.28 or 8.13% in 52 weeks, based on mean target price ($70.21) placed by analysts.The analyst consensus opinion of 2.8 looks like a hold. It has a 36-month beta of 0.51 , so you might not be in for a bumpy ride.  For the past 5 years, Kellogg Company’s EPS growth has been nearly -3.8%. Sure, the percentage is discouraging but better times are ahead as looking out over a next 5-year period, analysts expect the company to see its earnings go up by 6.39%, annually.  Kellogg Company (K)’s ROE is 38.33%, while industry’s is 15.55%. The average ROE for the sector stands at 61.52%. The return on equity (ROE), also known as return on investment (ROI), is the best measure of the return, since it is the product of the operating performance, asset turnover, and debt-equity management of the firm. If a firm can borrow money and use it to achieve a higher return than the cost of the debt, then the leveraging creates additional revenue that accrues to stockholders as increased equity.  Kellogg Company’s ROA is 5.06%, while industry’s average is 8.36%. As with any return, the higher this number the better. However, it, too, needs to be taken into the context of a company’s peer group as well as its sector. The average return on assets for companies in the same sector is 26.8. The return on assets (ROA) (aka return on total assets, return on average assets), is one of the most widely used profitability ratios because it is related to both profit margin and asset turnover, and shows the rate of return for both creditors and investors of the company. ROA shows how well a company controls its costs and utilizes its resources.

 Profitability and Returns Growth alone cannot be used to see if the company will be valuable. Shareholders will be the losers if a company invest in ventures that aren’t profitable enough to support upbeat growth. In order for us to accurately measure profitability and return, we will be using Return on Investment (ROI), which balances the difference in capital structure. The ROI of AGN is 0.10% while that of YY is 19.10%. These figures suggest that YY ventures generate a higher ROI than that of AGN. Cash Flow  
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 The value of a stock is ultimately determined by the amount of cash flow that the investors have available. Over the last 12 months, AGN’s free cash flow per share is a positive 7.33, while that of YY is positive 0. Liquidity and Financial Risk The ability of a company to meet up with its short-term obligations and be able to clear its longer-term debts is measured using Liquidity and leverage ratios. The current ratio for AGN is 1.20 and that of YY is 3.30. This implies that it is easier for AGN to cover its immediate obligations over the next 12 months than YY. The debt ratio of AGN is 0.46 compared to 0.06 for YY. AGN can be able to settle its long-term debts and thus is a lower financial risk than YY. Valuation AGN currently trades at a forward P/E of 10.96, a P/B of 0.88, and a P/S of 3.75 while YY trades at a forward P/E of 16.15, a P/B of 5.21, and a P/S of 4.85. This means that looking at the earnings, book values and sales basis, AGN is the cheaper one. It is very obvious that earnings are the most important factors to investors, thus analysts are most likely to place their bet on the P/E. Analyst Price Targets and Opinions The mistake some people make is that they think a cheap stock has more value to it. In order to know the value of a stock, there is need to compare its current price to its likely trading price in the future. The price of AGN is currently at a -24.24% to its one-year price target of 230.78. Looking at its rival pricing, YY is at a 16.57% relative to its price target of 104.33. This figure implies that over the next one year, YY is a better investment. When looking at the investment recommendation on say a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell), AGN is given a 2.20 while 1.80 placed for YY. This means that analysts are more bullish on the outlook for AGN stocks. Insider Activity and Investor Sentiment Short interest or otherwise called the percentage of a stock’s tradable shares currently being shorted is another data that investors use to get a handle on sentiment. The short ratio for AGN is 2.23 while that of YY is just 0.55. This means that analysts are more bullish on the forecast for YY stock. Conclusion The stock of YY Inc. defeats that of Allergan plc when the two are compared, with YY taking 6 out of the total factors that were been considered. YY happens to be more profitable, generates a higher ROI, has higher cash flow per share, higher liquidity and has a lower financial risk. When looking at the stock valuation, YY is the cheaper one on an earnings, book value and sales basis. Finally, the sentiment signal for YY is better on when it is viewed on short interest.

U.S. stock futures are rising heading into the open, as Wall Street returns from the Thanksgiving holiday weekend. Retailers remain in focus, as Black Friday numbers roll in amid a fresh influx of shopping on Cyber Monday. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Macy’s Inc (NYSE:M) both continue to grab headlines this morning. At last check, Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were up 0.03%, while S&P 500 futures had gained 0.02% and Nasdaq-100 futures were off 0.07%. On the options front, volume was nearly non-existent on Friday (yes, the market was open). Overall, only about 9.2 million calls and 6.6 million puts changed hands. On the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio rose to 0.62, while the 10-day moving average hit a two-week low of 0.63. Diving into Friday’s options activity, Amazon was front and center amid retailers attracting Black Friday call options activity due to reports that holiday shoppers were on track to spend more this year than in previous shopping seasons. Macy’s was also a subject of options speculation, as analysts projected a strong performance based on a beefed up online shopping platform. Finally, Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) was in focus after reports surfaced that Broadcom Ltd (NASDAQ:AVGO) was considering boosting its takeover bid for the chipmaker.  According to Adobe Analytics, Black Friday sales are expected to have hit a record high $5 billion this year, with another $6.6 billion for online retailers on Cyber Monday. AMZN stock rallied more than 2.5% on Friday following the reports, albeit amid light holiday volume. Still, Amazon stock is still rising this morning, gaining half-a-percent in premarket activity. Amazon has dominated the retail space in recent years, especially on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, due to the convenience of shopping from home in your pajamas — it’s what I did this year, and one of the major reasons I’m bullish long-term on AMZN stock. AMZN options traders rallied behind Amazon’s continued retail dominance on Friday, with volume jumping to over 214,000 contracts, or nearly double the stock’s daily average despite an extremely light trading session. Calls made up 57% of the day’s take, which is above average daily call activity for AMZN stock during the past month. Short-term expectations through December expiration are not quite as bullish, however. The December put/call open interest ratio comes in at 1.35, with puts easily outnumbering calls among front-month options. This negativity is understandable with the shares trading near all-time highs, but these bears may get burned as AMZN rallies through the holiday season.

Welcome to Black Friday! It’s the day that U.S. retailers finally turn a profit for the year, and their ledger books are officially “in the black.” Black Friday is the ultimate celebration of capitalism. A bacchanalian feast of doorbuster deals on electronics, home goods, toys and anything else you can stuff under (or beside) a Christmas tree. Get the entire 10-part series on our in-depth study on activist investing in PDF. Save it to your desktop, read it on your tablet, or print it out to read anywhere! Sign up below! This undeniably American holiday has even spilled over into Thanksgiving, with many of you likely staying out late last night to stand in line for a supremely discounted TV, gaming system or some other must-have holiday gift. Personally, I’m at home in my flannels — and have probably been so since Thanksgiving morning. I’ll be waking up late following a cocktail of Cincinnati craft beer, turkey with all the fixin’s, and excellent conversation and games with family. I don’t stand in line for doorbuster deals. I don’t brave the throngs of people rushing into Walmart, Best Buy and the local malls. I don’t have to lay down the back seats of the family minivan to accommodate a wealth of gift-wrapped packages. Thanks to Amazon.com Inc. (Nasdaq: AMZN), I can do all my holiday shopping in my pajamas while eating leftovers and drinking a holiday stout. Like many investors, I have a bit of a love-hate relationship with Amazon. The company has a habit of overspending and eating into earnings — thus negatively impacting AMZN’s stock price. In my last serious look at Amazon, I argued that the company’s heavy spending ways would return and undermine AMZN stock investments. I have to say, Amazon proved me wrong with its last quarterly earnings report. Earnings and revenue both rose, as the company finally appeared to have struck a balance between massive spending and sales. And while I’m not yet ready to concede the grocery market to Amazon and its acquisition of Whole Foods Market, the company has some solid prospects there if it can get delivery and online ordering right. Putting the grocery market aside, there are two major reasons to hold AMZN stock long term. The first comes down to what I and many other holiday shoppers are doing today (and will continue to do through Cyber Monday): shop from the comfort of our own homes while avoiding the insanity that is Black Friday and the holiday shopping season. Personally, I cannot stress the importance of this convenience enough. Will there be better deals at my local Best Buy or Walmart? Maybe. Are they worth dealing with holiday shoppers, holiday traffic and everything that goes along with them? Not for me, or for many other holiday shoppers cozied up in their homes basking in the glow of their tablets or laptop PCs. The second reason to be bullish long term on AMZN stock is the company’s potential gains from the cord-cutting movement. Amazon has emerged as one of the new “Big Three” in American entertainment, joining Netflix Inc. (Nasdaq: NFLX) in toppling the old guard of broadcast television and cutting deeply into the pocketbooks of pay-TV purveyors like Comcast, AT&T and Walt Disney. Amazon is spending $4.5 billion this year on original content, and has firmly solidified its spot as the No. 2 option for online streaming entertainment. There are a few drawbacks to investing in AMZN stock right now, however — especially from a long-term perspective. The shares are in consolidation mode following a massive post-earnings rally. (It seems I wasn’t the only one surprised that Amazon could increase spending and still see a rise in earnings.) The earnings-driven rally has taken AMZN into all-time-high territory, and the shares are hovering near overbought levels as a result. AMZN stock has outstripped its 50- and 200-day moving averages, while its short-term 10- and 20-day trendlines are only just now catching up.  The conundrum for those investors looking to add AMZN to their portfolios is that there is still some consolidation and short-term downside risk to work off, even as Amazon heads into the holiday shopping season. However, any pullback should be a buying opportunity. One way to make sure you don’t overpay for AMZN stock is to follow my colleague Chad Shoop’s strategy of using a put sell position to essentially name your price. By selling a put option at the price you wish to pay for Amazon shares — I’d likely set a target near $1,115 or $1,120 — you can collect the option premium, and sit back and wait for AMZN to trade in your target range. In the meantime, I hope you are enjoying your Thanksgiving holiday. I’ll leave you with this entertaining article from IndyStar that lists a few choice 1-star reviews for some of Amazon’s hottest Black Friday deals. Until next time, good trading! Joseph Hargett
Assistant Managing Editor, Banyan Hill Publishing Editor’s Note: As great as the gains in tech stocks like AMZN have been, Real Wealth Strategist Editor Matt Badiali has found a company in the natural resources sector that could make you much more money — even giving you the chance to turn every $1,000 invested into a $31,130 windfall. If this company does only half of what Matt is expecting, it will make you incredibly wealthy. But before you get carried away imagining what you’d do with that much money, click here now to learn Matt’s investing secret — the very secret he used to help his readers make 2,178% in gains.

Amazon has rolled out a consultancy program with the goal of assisting consumers with cloud machine learning. The company plans to do this by connecting clients with their own experts. Dubbed the Amazon ML Solutions Lab, it helps clients unfamiliar with machine learning to find beneficial and efficient uses of it for their company. Amazon plans to do this by integrating brainstorming with workshops to help clients understand machine learning by cloud better. The company will also be utilizing its experts to act as advisors to clients. Together they will work through the problems the company will face and then come up with machine learning-based resolutions. Amazon's cloud experts will also be checking in with the company weekly to see how the project progresses. AWS ramps up in AI with new Rekognition features and consultancy services https://t.co/Cjd4va860B by @ingridlunden — TechCrunch (@TechCrunch) November 22, 2017  No two solutions will be alike though, as the ML Solutions Lab will work according to the needs of the business. For instance, Amazon could send their developers on site if the client wants a more hands-on approach or clients could go to AWS' Seattle headquarters for training. How long the ML Solutions Lab will work with the company will also depend on the client. But it's expected to last anywhere from 3 to 6 months. Companies that have more experience with machine learning can avail of the ML Solutions Lab Express. It's an expedited program that runs for a month and begins with a 7-day intensive bootcamp in Amazon headquarters. However, this program is only offered to companies with machine-learning quality data since it's geared towards feature engineering and building models swiftly. Amazon has not shared any details yet on how much the program will cost companies. No information has been posted on its website yet and company representatives are reportedly not responding to any requests at the moment. Vinayak Agarwal, Amazon's senior product manager for AWS Deep Learning, pointed out in a blog post that the company has been immersed in machine learning for the past two decades. He also added that Amazon has pioneered innovations in areas like forecasting, logistics, supply chain optimization, personalization and fraud prevention. Agarwal further enjoined clients to take a closer look at the Amazon recommendations and fraud prevention ML Solutions Lab, saying that they will have access to the experts that developed most of the company's machine learning-based products and services. The Amazon ML Solutions Lab is being offered to customers worldwide. However, the ML Solutions Lab Express is currently exclusive to US clients.

Source: Shutterstock Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) appears poised to take over the world. From groceries, to streaming, to its original business of retail, Amazon seems to succeed at everything it does — and AMZN stock reflects this. The stock prices of competitors fall at the mere hint of having Amazon as a competitor. Dozens of cities have offered billions in tax breaks to secure its second headquarters. However, amid its popularity, a pattern of history repeating itself has emerged. And this pattern bodes poorly for AMZN stock. Amazon is becoming the new Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT). In roughly a generation, Walmart emerged from obscurity in rural Arkansas to become the world’s largest retailer. Walmart’s bulk pricing, advances in supply chains and, eventually, the power to force supplier cost cuts made WMT a retail behemoth that everyone feared — much like Amazon today. However, other companies caught up on pricing and surpassed Walmart on product quality. Furthermore, reports of poor working conditions cut into WMT’s popularity and, eventually, its stock price. Unfortunately for owners of AMZN stock, some of the same trends have emerged at Amazon. Amazon has failed in many areas. Reports of poor working conditions have become more frequent. Stories of product failures have also emerged. As my colleague Dana Blankenhorn mentioned, the Amazon Fire smartphone did not burn its competitors. Amazon Register also failed to defeat tiny Square Inc (NASDAQ:SQ) in the credit card reader market. Moreover, the Amazon Prime streaming movie offerings never became a threat to Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX). While AMZN succeeds in many areas, it has failed on many occasions as well. Yet, despite the failures, Amazon’s reputation for success and growth drive the AMZN stock price. AMZN trades at nearly 300 times current earnings. Revenue growth has averaged over 23% per year over the last five years. This is an impressive feat for a company with a market cap of close to $550 billion. Along with a 5-year average net income increase of 30%, high growth metrics have driven Amazon stock to over 22 times book value. The long-term worry involves the stock following in Walmart’s footsteps and experiencing a slowdown in growth. As a comparison, Walmart trades at 23 times earnings and less than 4 times book value. Its growth has slowed to an average of 1.7% in terms of revenue and income has actually been declining — to the tune of 2.8%. Matching Walmart’s PE ratio would bring the AMZN stock price to below $100 per share. At least for now, the hunter has become the hunted. The fear Walmart once inspired has been brought forth on Walmart itself by Amazon. Competitors such as Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) and Kroger Co (NYSE:KR) have also seen stock declines by the mere presence of Amazon in markets they compete in.

Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) is an interesting player in the Services space, with a focus on Catalog & Mail Order Houses. The stock has been active on the tape, currently trading at $1156.16, up from yesterday’s close by 1.46%. Given the stock’s recent action, it seemed like a good time to take a closer look at the company’s recent data. Fundamental Analysis Does this stock stack up well when compared to its peers in the industry space? Let’s take a look. Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) currently trades with a market capitalization of $560.77 Billion. That value represents a market adjusting for revenues that have been growing by 33.72 % on a quarterly year/year basis as of the company’s last quarterly report. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For AMZN, the company currently has $12.77 Billion of cash on the books, which is offset by $6.58 Billion current liabilities. You can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $7.72 Billion over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to fall in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $1.84 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 61.96% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors. Technical Analysis Sometimes, we can understand most about a stock by simply looking at how it has been trading. Looking at the stock’s movement on the chart, Amazon.com, Inc. recorded a 52-week high of $1140.00. It is now trading -16.16% off that level. The stock is trading $1,032.03 its 50-day moving average by -1155.16%. The stock carved out a 52-week low down at $736.70. In recent action, Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) has made a move of +18.84% over the past month, which has come on Strong relative transaction volume. Over the trailing year, the stock is underperforming the S&P 500 by 17.88, and it’s gotten there by action that has been more volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. In terms of the mechanics underlying that movement, traders will want to note that the stock is trading on a float of 1.47% with $402.34 Million sitting short, betting on future declines. That suggests something of the likelihood of a short squeeze in shares of AMZN.

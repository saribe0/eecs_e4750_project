BABA – Alibaba’s growth this year has been incredible, and critics are doubtful the gains can continue. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA) has more than doubled in 2017, as the Chinese superpower continues to dominate the e-commerce world — and a growing share of other sectors — throughout Asia. As is typically the case when a stock surges this much this quickly, critics are crawling out of the woodwork to predict a downturn. But as the The Motley Fool notes, BABA’s growth may only just beginning: The e-commerce giant’s reach is undeniable. It has reached 488 million active customers over the past four quarters. Several analysts have been jacking up their price targets in recent weeks, keeping up with the perpetually improving fundamentals.  Alibaba stock isn’t cheap on an absolute basis, trading at 38 times this fiscal year’s projected profit and a still-steep 29 times next year’s analyst profit target. However, it is growing faster than those multiples at the moment. Some of the Alibaba bashers have been wrong all the way up, and while the stock gains only stretch their valuation arguments, one can also argue that if the metrics they claim are too good to be true are legit, then we may just be scratching the surface on the stock gains. Alibaba’s on a roll in 2017, and momentum is still on the side of the bulls. Perhaps that’s the only leg that BABA bears have left to stand on: questioning the company’s accounting practices. Because if their numbers are legit, we’re likely in for a lot more gains next year. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd shares closed at $191.19 on Friday, up $1.35 (+0.71%). Year-to-date, BABA has gained 117.73%, versus a 18.14% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period. BABA currently has a StockNews.com POWR Rating of A (Strong Buy), and is ranked #1 of 77 stocks in the China category.

U.S. stock futures are headed higher amid light volume in this Thanksgiving-holiday-shortened trading week. Wall Street is gearing up for the holiday shopping season, and retailers are higher as Black Friday, the biggest shopping day of the year, approaches. Meanwhile, traders are digesting news that Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen will leave the central bank completely, rather than stay on as a Fed governor. Heading into the open, Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are up 0.42%, while S&P 500 futures have gained 0.33% and Nasdaq-100 futures have rallied 0.45%. On the options front, volume was light on Monday, with many traders heading for home early for Thanksgiving. Overall, about 15.3 million calls and 11.2 million puts changed hands. On the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio rose to 0.59 and the 10-day moving average held at 0.65. Diving into Monday’s options activity, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA) delved further into brick-and-mortar retailing with a stake in China-based Sun Art Retail Group. Elsewhere, Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) set the official date for its first-quarter earnings report, while AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) is gearing up for a legal battle with the Department of Justice over its Time Warner Inc (NYSE:TWX) acquisition.  Alibaba, the world’s largest online retailing company, once again took aim at brick-and-mortar stores yesterday by taking a $2.9 billion stake in Chinese grocery firm Sun Art Retail Group. With roughly 400 hypermarkets across the country, Sun Art is Wal-Mart Stores Inc.’s (NYSE:WMT) biggest competitor in China. Alibaba now holds a 36% stake in Sun Art. BABA options traders cheered the move, sending more than 256,000 contracts across the tape on Monday — roughly 1.3% of the stock’s daily average options volume. Calls made up an above average 63% of the day’s take. The attention to bullish calls continues a shift in sentiment toward BABA stock, which has seen its December put/call open interest ratio decline in recent weeks. This sentiment indicator now rests at 0.92, which is still indicative of negativity toward BABA, but the shift toward calls should be a bullish driver for the shares.

https://stocknewsgazette.com/2017/11/20/alibaba-group-holding-limited-baba-interesting-series-of-developments-taking-place-3/

Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) is an interesting stock at present. Now trading with a market value of 474.91B, the company has a mix of catalysts and obstacles that spring from the nature of its operations. As the day-to-day narrative ebbs and flows for this company, it is more important than ever to step back and get a bird’s eye view of the fundamental reality under the surface of this story. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) Fundamentals That Matter It’s generally a good idea to start with the most fundamental piece of the picture: the balance sheet. The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For BABA, the company currently has 22.83 billion of cash on the books, which is offset by 2.46 billion in current liabilities. The trend over time is important to note. In this case, the company’s debt has been growing. The company also has 87.16 billion in total assets, balanced by 31.74 billion in total liabilities, which should give you a sense of the viability of the company under any number of imagined business contexts. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA) saw 3.28 billion in free cash flow last quarter, representing a quarterly net change in cash of 536.07 million. Perhaps most importantly where cash movements are concerned, the company saw about 4.57 billion in net operating cash flow.

 Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) Revenue Growth Potential As far as key trends that demonstrate something of the future investment potential of this stock, we need to take a closer look at the top line, first and foremost. Last quarter, the company saw 8.26 billion in total revenues. That represents a quarterly year/year change in revenues of 0.61 in sequential terms, the BABA saw sales decline by 0.13. But what about the bottom line? After all, that’s what really matters in the end. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA) is intriguing when broken down to its core data. The cost of selling goods last quarter was 3.56 billion, yielding a gross basic income of 4.7 billion. For shareholders, given the total diluted outstanding shares of 2.61 billion, this means overall earnings per share of 1.02. Note, this compares with a consensus analyst forecast of 1.45 in earnings per share for its next fiscal quarterly report. 
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Is Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) Valuation Attractive Looking ahead at valuations, according to the consensus, the next fiscal year is forecast to bring about 5.69 in total earnings per share. If we consider a median price to earnings ratio on the stock, that corresponds with a stock price of 27.46. However, one should always remember: the trends are more important than the forecasts. This continues to be an interesting story, and we look forward to updating it again soon on Alibaba Group Holding Limited.

By Deseret News editorial board During the holiday season, public officials urge drivers to be safe behind the wheel. This means never mixing alcohol and driving. Debate has once again surfaced over Utah’s decision to lower the legal blood alcohol content (BAC) from 0.08 percent to 0.05 percent. It is a smart public health decision, which we continue to support. Utah is wise to lead out in promoting safer drinking laws. In late March, Gov. Gary Herbert signed HB 155 into law, which goes into effect in a year. Colorado drivers can already receive lesser criminal charges with a BAC of 0.05, but the minimum for a DUI infraction is still 0.08 in other states. When the law takes effect, Utah may become the first state to have a legal BAC below 0.08 percent. It would also be the first to implement the National Transportation Safety Board’s recommendation from 2013 that a safer BAC is 0.05 percent. Nationwide, for commercial drivers, the BAC level for a DUI or DWI is set even lower at .04 percent. Unsurprisingly, Utah's law was met with criticism from lobbyists at the American Beverage Industry. Two of their central concerns relate to the idea that this law would hurt tourism and that it would only benefit members of the state’s majority religion, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which owns this paper. These, of course, were two arguments trotted out back when Utah became the first state to reduce the BAC level to 0.08 percent. Back then, after Utah led out, the rest of the nation followed. The rationale for lowering the BAC in other states had little to do with a “majority religion” — but had everything to do with public safety and science. That is still true. Meanwhile, there’s little evidence to suggest that the new law will affect tourism. Has Sweden lost tourists because the country’s BAC level is 0.02 percent? Last year, Sweden attracted more nonresident tourists than any of its Nordic neighbors. Recent data suggest that nonresident tourists in Utah spent 75 percent more on “amusement and recreation,” including winter sports such as skiing and snowboarding, than they did on alcoholic beverages. This statistic supports a common-knowledge fact about Utah: It is known for its breathtaking and varied national parks and world-class mountain resorts, not its drinking culture. It does not attract the same clientele as, say, a city like Las Vegas, where tourism is dependent on entertainment, gambling and, of course, food and alcohol consumption. Tourists will still be drawn to Utah after this law goes into effect for the state’s main attraction: the natural landscape. Second, while 60 percent of Utahns identify as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and choose in large numbers to refrain from alcohol, the public health implications of drunk driving affect all citizens. In addition to Sweden, many other countries have set their legal BAC at 0.05 percent or lower, and in Europe they enjoy some of the lowest rates of drunk driving fatalities in the world. This success, of course, also involves a high reliance on public transportation and a cultural orientation toward supporting healthy alcohol habits. Yet, with the advent of increasingly greater access to ride-hailing, there are options for those who shouldn’t get behind the wheel. As Deseret News columnist Jay Evensen recently pointed out, the new BAC law that goes into effect the last day 2018, represents the “combined wisdom of the World Medical Association, American Medical Association, British Medical Association, European Commission, European Transport Safety Council, World Health Organization, Canadian Medical Association, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health and Association for the Advancement of Automotive Medicine, not to mention the Utah state Legislature and the National Transportation Safety Board.” Utah’s decision to lower the legal BAC level limit is based on sound science and data, and it marks an important step in the right direction toward ensuring the public health and safety of all of Utah’s citizens.

https://seekingalpha.com/news/3314418-bank-loan-growth-slowing

The economy is apparently humming along and interest rates - while rising - remain low, so what gives? According to FDIC numbers, 12-month loan growth rate fell for the 6th straight quarter in Q3 to its weakest since the end of 2013. Digging deeper, the growth rate of business lending fell to its slowest since the start of 2011. Combine slowing loan growth and a flattening yield curve, and one wonders about the prospects for bank earnings next year. "The plane used to be flying at 30,000 feet, now it’s at 10,000,” says FIG Partners' Chris Marinac. "There are many banks that are concerned about how much they can grow the loan book in 2018.” Checking individual players in Q3, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and BofA (NYSE:BAC) saw loan growth of 3% Y/Y, while Citigroup (NYSE:C) had 2%, and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) posted a 1% decline. Smaller banks hardly fared better. Loans were about flat at BB&T (NYSE:BBT), with CEO Kelly King saying clients seemed more interested in raising money in the bond market to pay down bank loans.

Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) recently upgraded  shares of  Barclays PLC (ADR)  (NYSE: BCS) by two notches from Underperform to Buy. BofA Merrill Lynch cited the underperformance of Barclays' shares and depressed earnings expectations as the reason for its improved assessment. Financial firms are in a sector where it's necessary to rate each other's performance — a sort of  peer review.  The question is whether they can adopt an unbiased stance on firms with  which they compete or cooperate. A  research paper  on this issue, "Are Analysts' Recommendations for Other Investment Banks Biased," published in December 2013, suggests analysts give optimistic recommendations for investment banks with which their bank is syndicated. A syndicate, according to  Investopedia,  is forging of a temporary relationship among financial services firms for handling a large transaction, which might otherwise be difficult to handle individually. Benzinga looked at which Wall Street firm has the most number of top-notch ratings accorded to it by its peer group. One must keep in mind that the numbers are also a function of factors such as a covered company's size and how widely it's held.   The ratings are sourced from  TipRanks,  an analytics firm that tracks and measures performance of over 50,000 financial experts.

  During the recent trading sessions stock of Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) was gathering the crowd in the stock market. Analysts often use price and volume data to predict future stock performance. In the case of BAC, the chart has some interesting things to say about where the stock might be headed. How has the stock performed recently? Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) in the last month has decreased -1.55%. Shares are now up over the past year, outperforming the broad market by -100% and outperformed a peer group of similar companies by 125%. After the latest session, which saw the stock close at a price of $26.74, BAC sits below its 52-week high. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) has been trading in a bullish manner, based on the relative positions of the stock’s 20 and 200 day moving averages. Momentum indicators 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that BAC may be headed in the future. In order to predict this, technical analysts look at momentum indicators, which measure the speed and magnitude of these price movements. The idea is that as momentum slows, it may signal the approach of key support or resistance levels and a reversal of recent trends. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for BAC is 53.49%, which suggests that the stock is not particularly expensive or cheap, and not predisposed to a reactive price movement based on this measure. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 41.32%, tells a similar story, and suggests that BAC currently trades in neutral territory. What do the trading volumes reveal? In addition to price, analysts use volume trends to predict future performance. The level of trading activity in a stock is often a good proxy for the level of interest and enthusiasm for the name within the investment community. A sudden increase in activity can be a sign that investors are trading in anticipation of a catalyst. Bank of America Corporation (BAC) average trading volume of 62,094,230 during the past month is 19.82% below its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been less active than usual in the stock in recent times. What do the analysts think? BAC is currently undervalued by -5.48% relative to the average 1-year price target of $28.29 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 2.10, which implies that analysts are generally neutral in their outlook for BAC over the next year. How risky is the stock?  In order to put BAC’s recent price performance into context, we need to get a sense of how the stock moves in relation to the overall market. Beta, which measures a stock’s price volatility relative to the market, provides the cleanest measure of systematic risk for a stock. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) has a beta of 1.32, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are more extreme than the market as a whole. BAC therefore has a above average level of market risk. During the past couple of weeks, BAC average daily volatility was 16.09%, which is 2.48 percentage points lower than the average volatility over the past 100 days.

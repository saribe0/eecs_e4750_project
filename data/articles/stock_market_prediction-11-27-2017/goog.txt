    After Google reportedly confirmed the practice of gathering location data from Android devices even when the service was disabled by users, regulators in South Korea summoned representatives of the tech giant this week for questioning. Data protection officials in Britain are also looking into the matter, CNNMoney reported on Friday. The probe in South Korea follows a report by Quartz which found that Android phones have been collecting the addresses of nearby mobile towers-even when location services are disabled -and sending that data back to Google. This makes search engine giant and the unit of Alphabet behind Android to have access to huge amount of data that invades their privacy. Users cannot opt out of this even when their devices are factory reset, the report said.  Google reportedly confirmed the move which was undertaken “to improve the speed and performance of message delivery”. The Korea Communications Commission (KCC) “is carrying out an inquiry into the claims that Google collected users’ Cell ID data without consent even when their smartphone’s location service was inactive,” Chun Ji—hyun, head of KCC’s privacy infringement division, told CNNMoney on Friday. Google said Android phones are no longer requesting Cell ID codes, and collection should be phased out this month.

The U.S. economy is still on a tear, but businesses have stopped taking out loans from banks despite predictions that banks were bound to have a big year from that department. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Snap Inc (NYSE:SNAP) and Time Inc (NYSE:TIME) all made headlines during the weekend by developing a new feature, updating its social media app and agreeing to be bought out respectively. Here’s the skinny of it: Google has been granted a patent for a new feature that can track its user’s faces. Future Alphabet devices may come with the company’s latest technology, which consists of a smart, motorized lid attached to its Pixelbooks, which are laptop-tablet hybrids. The functionality hones in on the device’s user when they are nearby and opens up in the right configuration. It unlocks the device when necessary, while also keeping track of a user’s face as the lid is always aligned to the owner’s face. The patent — which Google filed for in 2013 — may be in a future Pixelbook and it works in a number of ways. It can tell when a user is nearby or when they are leaving the room. Its technology may use a wide-angle rear camera, a proximity sensor, a Bluetooth sensor or multiple of these. Users may also have the option of tapping a special area on the lid to authenticate and open it. The feature may use various techniques to recognize its users, including facial, fingerprint and voice recognition. One may also open the device through an authorized device such as a smartwatch or smartphone. GOOG stock gained 13.6% over the last three months and GOOGL shares rose 13.5% over the same span. Snap has rolled out a new algorithm designed to improve its app. Snapchat is already capable of placing your exact location on a map if you turn on the device’s mapping features, and now the social media company has found new ways to bolster your pictures with filters. The app now looks at what you are taking a picture of and suggests a filter or sticker that would work well with the images, shading, light and borders featured in your image.

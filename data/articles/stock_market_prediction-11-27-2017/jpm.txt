Jamie Dimon earlier this year called bitcoin a fraud and threatened to fire any JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) employee trading it. Bitcoin futures, however, may be a different story, and there would seemingly be little reason for the bank not to allow its futures brokerage customers access to that product when CME launches (set for Dec. 11, assuming regulatory approval). Commissions are commissions after all, and the Bank of Dimon wouldn't be incurring any bitcoin-related risk. It's a question any number of banks which offer customers access to CME futures products are going to have to answer. Now read: JPMorgan Chase & Co. 2017 Q3 - Results - Earnings Call Slides »

Jamie Dimon, chief executive officer of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (jpm), on Wednesday said he expects to see a new U.S. president in 2021 and advised the Democratic party to come up with a “pro-free enterprise” agenda for jobs and economic growth instead. Asked at a luncheon hosted by The Economic Club of Chicago how many years Republican President Donald Trump will be in office, Dimon said, “If I had to bet, I’d bet three and half. But the Democrats have to come up with a reasonable candidate … or Trump will win again.” Dimon, who in the past has described himself as “barely” a Democrat, has been going to Washington more often since the 2016 elections to lobby lawmakers on issues including changes in corporate taxes, immigration policies and mortgage finance. In December, Dimon became chairman of the Business Roundtable, an association of CEOs who take their views to government policymakers. Dimon, 61, touched on wide range of topics, from America’s political climate to racial discrimination to the effects of the U.K. leaving the European Union. He also commented on foreign affairs, saying, for example, “We should never be rude to a neighbor like Mexico” and cautioning that the political weakness of German Chancellor Angela Merkel “is bad for all of us.” Talks on forming a governing coalition including Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union collapsed earlier this week, casting doubt on her future after 12 years in power. Dimon spoke for several minutes about discrimination over gender and race which he said is not acknowledged enough in the United States. “If you’re white, paint yourself black and walk down the street one day, and you’ll probably have a little more empathy for how some of these folks get treated,” Dimon said. “We need to make a special effort because this is a special problem.” Dimon gave his own bank a mixed review on diversity. His direct reports include people who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender (LGBT), and half are women as are 30 percent of the top 200 JPMorgan executives, he said. Now in his 12th year as JPMorgan’s CEO, Dimon also reflected a bit on his own role. “I basically love my job,” Dimon said. “I mean, it’s tiring; it’s exhausting. I have to go down to Washington all the time and it’s a big pain in the ass, but I basically love my job.”

JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) has became attention seeker from the inquisitor when it experienced a change of -0.32% Whereas, in last 21 trading days was -2.67% and moved up in last 63 trading days of 7.00%. Looking further out we can see that the stock has moved 13.94% over the year to date. Along with these its last twelve month performance is stands at 24.68% while moved 15.18% for the past six months according to Finviz reported data. Analytical Significance of Simple Moving Average The SMA200 of the stock is at 7.84%, SMA20 is -1.10%, while SMA50 is 0.84%. JPM’s relative volume was 0.32. Relative volume is a great indicator to keep a close eye on, but like most indicators it works best in conjunction with other indicators and on different time frames. Higher relative volume you will have more liquidity in the stock which will tighten spreads and allow you to trade with more size without a ton of slippage. JPM’s overall volume in the last trading session was 3,680,043 shares. Important Technical Indicators to keep in Focus:- A statistical measure of the dispersion of returns (volatility) for JPM producing salvation in Investors mouth, it has week volatility of 0.90% and for the month booked as 1.22%. Regardless of which metric you utilize, a firm understanding of the concept of volatility and how it is measured is essential to successful investing. A stock that maintains a relatively stable price has low volatility. When investing in a volatile security, the risk of success is increased just as much as the risk of failure.  JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s beta is 1.21 whilst the stock has an average true range (ATR) of 1.20. Other technical indicators are worth considering in assessing the prospects for EQT. RSI for instance is currently at 48.80. It is common practice for investors to use the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio or price multiple) to determine if a company’s stock price is over or undervalued. Companies with a high P/E ratio are typically growth stocks. However, their relatively high multiples do not necessarily mean their stocks are overpriced and not good buys for the long term. The PEG ratio shows us that, when compare to the beer company, the always-popular tech company doesn’t have the growth rate to justify its higher P/E, and its stock price appears overvalued. JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s currently has a PEG ratio of 1.60 where as its P/E ratio is 14.10. The company P/S (price to Sales) ratio is 5.53, P/B (price to Book) ratio is 1.50, while its P/C (price to Cash) ratio stands at 0.29. Should You Go With High Insider Ownership? Many value investors look for stocks with a high percent of insider ownership, under the theory that when management are shareholders, they will act in its own self interest, and create shareholder value in the long-term. This aligns the interests of shareholders with management, thus benefiting everyone. While this sounds great in theory, high insider ownership can actually lead to the opposite result, a management team that is unaccountable because they can keep their jobs under almost any circumstance. Currently JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM)’s shares owned by insiders are 0.10%, whereas shares owned by institutional owners are 75.90%. November 27, 2017 November 27, 2017 November 27, 2017

 JP Morgan Chase & Co (JPM) reportedly extended its rented office space in Germany’s financial centre, Frankfurt, in a response to Britain’s exit from the EU. JP Morgan Chase shares closed lower for a third consecutive trading session on Friday. The stock edged down 0.32% ($0.32) to $98.32, after touching an intraday low at $98.26, or a price level not seen since November 20th ($97.76).  In the week ended on November 26th the shares of the financial group added 0.18% to their market value compared to a week ago, which marked a second consecutive period of gains.  However, the stock has extended its loss to 2.28% so far during the current month, following a 5.34% surge in October. The latter has been a second consecutive monthly gain and also the largest one since June.  For the entire past year, the shares of the NYSE-listed financial holding company rose 30.68%. The stock has gained another 13.94% so far in 2017. According to Reuters, citing a source with knowledge of the situation, the investment bank rented sufficient office space in the Taunusturm to accommodate 200 employees, while being able to fit additional staff in its existing offices in the 40-storey building. An earlier report by the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper said that the new rented space in the Taunusturm would be enough for up to 300 employees, as the bank had already located 450 staff in the 170-metre skyscraper. According to the source, JP Morgan intends to establish hubs in Frankfurt, Luxembourg and Dublin, but however, it still remains a matter of debate precisely which functions will be hosted at which of the cities. JP Morgan is the latest big bank to attempt to shift its operations to more than one hub, which only suggests how large the scale of London’s financial district is. According to CNN Money, the 26 analysts, offering 12-month forecasts regarding JP Morgan Chase & Co’s stock price, have a median target of $102.50, with a high estimate of $115.00 and a low estimate of $84.50.

 JP Morgan Chase & Co (JPM) reportedly extended its rented office space in Germany’s financial centre, Frankfurt, in a response to Britain’s exit from the EU. JP Morgan Chase shares closed lower for a third consecutive trading session on Friday. The stock edged down 0.32% ($0.32) to $98.32, after touching an intraday low at $98.26, or a price level not seen since November 20th ($97.76).  In the week ended on November 26th the shares of the financial group added 0.18% to their market value compared to a week ago, which marked a second consecutive period of gains.  However, the stock has extended its loss to 2.28% so far during the current month, following a 5.34% surge in October. The latter has been a second consecutive monthly gain and also the largest one since June.  For the entire past year, the shares of the NYSE-listed financial holding company rose 30.68%. The stock has gained another 13.94% so far in 2017. According to Reuters, citing a source with knowledge of the situation, the investment bank rented sufficient office space in the Taunusturm to accommodate 200 employees, while being able to fit additional staff in its existing offices in the 40-storey building. An earlier report by the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper said that the new rented space in the Taunusturm would be enough for up to 300 employees, as the bank had already located 450 staff in the 170-metre skyscraper. According to the source, JP Morgan intends to establish hubs in Frankfurt, Luxembourg and Dublin, but however, it still remains a matter of debate precisely which functions will be hosted at which of the cities. JP Morgan is the latest big bank to attempt to shift its operations to more than one hub, which only suggests how large the scale of London’s financial district is.

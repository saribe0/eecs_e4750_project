  Lockheed Martin Corp.  's LMT  business unit, Rotary and Mission Systems has won a modification contract to exercise an option period for the procurement of Technical Insertion (TI) 18-20 Acoustic Rapid Commercial Off-the-Shelf Insertion (A-RCI) engineering services.  makeArticleAd(); Contract Details    Valued at $122.3 million, this contract has been awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, DC. The majority of the work will be carried out in Manassas, VA, while the rest will be executed in Clearwater, FL.    Lockheed Martin will utilize fiscal 2018 research, development test and evaluation funds for the Navy to complete the work by December 2018.   A Brief Note on A-RCI Systems    A-RCI is an open-architecture sonar system that uses legacy sensors. It also replaces central processors with commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) computer technology and software within submarines.  This system helps the U.S. Navy in searching, detecting and tracking submarines and surface vessels in open-ocean and littoral sea environments without being counter-detected. Additionally, it facilitates covert execution of Naval Special Warfare missions as well as under-ice operations.    In the 1990s, Lockheed Martin unveiled A-RCI Systems that allowed frequent hardware and software upgrades. The system was highly effective and offered improved acoustic quieting measures at a far lower cost. Notably, the TI 18-20 A-RCI engineering services provide engineering development to support modernization requirements.   Our View    With the rapid rise in terrorist attacks over the last decade, the U.S. Navy's focus has shifted to littoral waters, the shallow areas near coastlines. In fact, patrolling in these areas has become need of the hour to defend against small subs, underwater mines and fast attack boats. Consequently, timely detection and localization of quiet subs in the especially noisy shallow-water sonar field has made the A-RCI submarine sonar system all the more critical. Additionally, constant upgrades of the system have made it more valuable for the nation's naval base and an attractive choice of defense equipment for the U.S. allied countries.    Furthermore, Lockheed Martin's Rotary and Mission Systems business carries out some of the company's high-profile programs. These include the Aegis Combat System, Littoral Combat Ship, MH-60 helicopter avionics along with military and commercial orders. The segment generated revenues of $3.4 billion in the third quarter of 2017, reflecting almost 27.9% of its total revenues.    Markedly, being the Pentagon's prime defense contractor, Lockheed Martin enjoys a lion's share of the aerospace-defense industry in the United States.    Moreover, the recently passed fiscal 2018 defense policy that authorized the United States' defense spending worth $700 billion has enhanced the prospect of increased order flow from Pentagon for major defense contractors like Lockheed Martin, Raytheon Company RTN  , Northrop Grumman Corporation NOC  , The Boeing Company BA  and others.    Considering the aforementioned developments, the company is expected to win more of such contracts in days ahead, given that most of its programs are the top priorities of Pentagon.   Price Movement    Lockheed Martin's stock was up about 18.9% in a year, underperforming the broader  industry  's gain of 34.3%. This could have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces for its broad portfolio of products and services domestically as well as internationally.

Voya Financial, Inc. (NYSE:VOYA) trades at $42.31 having a market capitalization of $7.61 billion. VOYA stock price climbed 11.64% over the past year, yielding a positive weighted alpha of 14.2 percent. Since an alpha above 1 hints at more gains, investors can predict some further rally scope.  Weighted Alpha is used to calculate how much a share has gone up or down over a certain period, normally a year. In general, more thrust is placed on most recent actions by assigning higher weights to it than those assigned to past movements. This assists to give a return figure that has a stronger focus on the most current period and is thus a better measure for short-term analysis. This technique is highly famous among technical analysts. If the stock is up it will have a positively weighted alpha. If the stock price is unchanged its weighted alpha will be smaller. A stock price loss will yield a negatively weighted alpha.  Support is likely to come between $42.02 a share to $41.73 a share level. However, if the VOYA shares go below $41.73 then it would indicate a much weaker market for the company. In that case, its shares would mark a 1.37% decline from the most recent price. The typical day in the last two weeks has seen about a 1.63% volatility. The average volume for Voya Financial, Inc. (NYSE:VOYA) has been 1.38 million shares per day over the past 30 days. VOYA has a 1-week performance of 2.15%. VOYA price is down nearly -1.54% from its 52-week high price of $42.96 a share but is up about 20.75% from its 52-week low price of $33.53 a share.  Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) has accumulated 2.15% over the course of one week. It seems that Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) might see muted action given an ABR of 2.1 or Hold rating. Analysts, on average, seem bullish as they suggest LMT is worth $13.08 more, giving a target price of $327.95 a share. VOYA share have rallied by 7.88% in percentage terms since the start of the year – and added 3.47% in the last month. Volume in the last session has decreased compared with VOYA’s average trading volume. We think the decreased volume is representative of sellers as it has displayed in many other cases.  LMT’s Stochastic Oscillator (%D) is at 62.4%. Values of %D line that are above 80 indicate that the security is overbought; prices could well fall in the near future. And the values below 20 that it is oversold indicate prices could very well bounce upwards. The Stochastic Oscillator is a powerful technical tool that is somewhat surprisingly easy to understand. In a basic sense, it is used by technicians to measure the speed or momentum of the price movement. It represents the location of the previous close relative to the price range over a set number of periods. This can be more easily understood, however, by pulling apart the two lines on the stochastic oscillator and explaining the simple underlying mathematical formulas. The first line is called the %K line, which analyzes the actual price movements in the shares and can be defined as: %K = (Current Close – Lowest Low)/(Highest High – Lowest Low) * 100. The second line, the %D line is simple a 3-day moving average of the %K line. There are three primary ways to read the Stochastic Oscillator in search of entry points, but traders should follow the %D line closely because that indicates major trends on the chart.  Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)’s latest quote $314.87 $0.12 -0.65% will find technical support in $313.86 a share and a breakdown below this region would be a significantly bearish signal for Lockheed Martin Corporation traders. Any way you dice it, a dip below $312.85 a share would be very bad news for LMT’s technical picture in the near-term. The $312.85 level represents at least another 0.64% downside for the stock from its current price. If Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) shares can stay above the price resistance around $316.37 a share, that could help propel Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) higher to the next line of resistance at $317.87 a share. The typical day in the last one month has seen about a 1.15% volatility. LMT is down around 22.03% from its 12-month high of $245.5 notched on Dec 12, 2016 but is 113.64% above its highest point the past 12 months of $-42.96 a share.

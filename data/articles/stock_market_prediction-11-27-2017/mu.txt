 On-Screen Marking System (OSM) service provider MeritTrac Services, under fire for the fiasco at Mumbai University in which results were delayed, blamed the shortage of MU evaluators, lack of co-ordination between stakeholders and MU’s own processing programme for tabulating results after evaluation. Responding to a questionnaire sent by The Hindu, the Bangalore-based service provider, which claims to be the country’s largest private testing and assessment company, said its role in MU was restricted to digitising answer scripts, making them available on the server, enabling evaluation through authorised computers and sharing scores with the university after evaluation. This, it says, is roughly 25% of the work involved in the evaluation process. Nagendran Sundarajan, executive vice-president, MeritTrac, said, “Under ideal conditions, the evaluation process should have lagged the availability of answer scripts in the server by just one week to 10 days. Unfortunately, teachers’ availability hampered the progress of evaluation process. Evaluation for some of the last few programmes were extended by the university till September 2017.”  Mr. Sundarajan added that some of the most critical activities, including tabulation of results, incorporating internal assessment marks, assigning overall weightage were not part of MeritTrac’s scope of work. “This is where most of the delays occurred. The university, through its own result-processing programme, checks for attendance and other rules involved before sending it to its website and processing unit for printing mark sheets.”  ‘We’re totally capable’ Refuting allegations that it was unable to handle a large-scale operation like the one at MU, MeritTrac said its platform is capable of handling up to one lakh evaluations per day, which is beyond MU’s requirement.  It also denied allegations that it was unable to handle supplements taken by students beyond 40 pages in the main answer sheets. A company representative said, “We have no issues in digitising even 1,000 pages, but the supplements will have to be logically tagged to the main answer script through appropriate or unique bar codes, or through a back-end system of unique seat numbers by the university. The scope of printing the blank answer scripts, allocating bar codes series, seat numbers are under the university.”  It also brushed aside allegations that 3,000 answer sheets went missing during the first semester exams in this academic year due to its negligence. “At all points of time, the answer scripts were kept only within the university premises. So, there was no question of MeritTrac losing the answer scripts. MeritTrac team was only given access in to the university premises to do the scanning activity. These premises were always under the supervision of the university security personnel.”  Dr Ashok Yende, director, Mumbai Law Academy at MU, said, “Yes, there was some non-cooperation by evaluators this year due to then-VC Sanjay Deshmukh’s decision to introduce OSM just before the exams. It’s also a fact that evaluators sat through slow downloads, had wrong answer sheets opening on screens and other technical problems. Yes, there is a shortage of evaluators for courses like Law, since most are part-timers. This issue had always been there, and manually evaluated results were faster despite such issues.”  A company official added, “MeritTrac is just one element in the larger ecosystem. The university has to bring entities together, drive the process and manage their internal moving parts. Ensuring speed and timelines of evaluation would ensure faster turnaround time.”

 The Mumbai University has set up two flying squads of Information Technology experts to check paper leaks in colleges affiliated to it.  The teams will be part of the Company Infrastructure Inspection Committee and would pay surprise visits to examination centres. They would also look into whether colleges are following the standard operating procedure while receiving the question papers online. A single member committee had recommended setting up the teams after question papers of the Bachelor of Management Studies and Bachelor of Commerce (Accounting and Finance) exams were leaked recently.  The committee found that colleges were “flouting the SOP laid down by the Digital Exam Paper Delivery System either deliberately or due to plain ignorance”.  Under the system, which was introduced in 2013, the MU digitally transfers question papers to examination centres in colleges. The passwords for unlocking the papers are later sent to the mobiles of the principals and one of their nominees. An MU official said, “The links of the question papers are first sent to the colleges. The passwords to download the papers are sent much later. Colleges are expected to download the question papers only from a desktop computer, never a laptop, and only in an CCTV-equipped enclosed room.”  The official said CCTV cameras are also required to be installed near the photostat machines while copies of the question papers are being made. The official said that the committee realised all colleges and staff were not aware of the procedures and recommended forming flying squads to implement the security measures.

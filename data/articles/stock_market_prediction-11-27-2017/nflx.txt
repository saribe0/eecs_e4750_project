Netflix Inc (NFLX) touched 195.75 on a recent bid indicating that the Tenkan line is still hovering below the Kijun Sen.  This represents bearish momentum for the shares. Whether or not the shares are ready to break further to the downside is yet to be seen.  
The Tenkan Sen / Kijun Sen Cross signal occurs when the Tenkan Sen (Turning line) crosses the Kijun Sen (Standard line). A bearish signal occurs when the Tenkan Sen crosses from above to below the Kijun Sen. The Ichimoku Kinko Hyo system includes five kinds of signal, of which this site highlights the most recent of each for each ticker.
The Ichimoku signals, including all Ichimoku elements, should never be taken in isolation, but considered in the context of the overall chart. Ichimoku Kinko Hyo is a visual technical analysis system and the charts are designed to be considered in their entirety, with regard given to the relationships between all of the elements, including the price. As such, Ichimoku is not suitable for automated or “single event” decision making.
Active traders have a wide range of additional technical indicators at their disposal for when completing technical stock analysis. Currently, the 14-day ATR for Netflix Inc (NFLX) is spotted at 3.82. First developed by J. Welles Wilder, the ATR may assist traders in determining if there is heightened interest in a trend, or if extreme levels may be signaling a reversal. Simply put, the ATR determines the volatility of a security over a given period of time, or the tendency of the security to move one direction or another.
Checking in on some other technical levels, the 14-day RSI is currently at 52.32, the 7-day stands at 52.15, and the 3-day is sitting at 56.29. The RSI, or Relative Strength Index, is a commonly used technical momentum indicator that compares price movement over time. The RSI was created by J. Welles Wilder who was striving to measure whether or not a stock was overbought or oversold. The RSI may be useful for spotting abnormal price activity and volatility. The RSI oscillates on a scale from 0 to 100. The normal reading of a stock will fall in the range of 30 to 70. A reading over 70 would indicate that the stock is overbought, and possibly overvalued. A reading under 30 may indicate that the stock is oversold, and possibly undervalued.
Another technical indicator that may be a powerful resource for determining trend strength is the Average Directional Index or ADX. The ADX was introduced by J. Welles Wilder in the late 1970’s and it has stood the test of time. The ADX is typically used in conjunction with the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI) to help spot trend direction as well as trend strength. At the time of writing, the 14-day ADX for Netflix Inc (NFLX) is noted at 12.37. Many technical analysts believe that an ADX value over 25 would suggest a strong trend. A reading under 20 would indicate no trend, and a reading from 20-25 would suggest that there is no clear trend signal.
The Williams Percent Range or Williams %R is another technical indicator worth taking a look at. Netflix Inc (NFLX) currently has a 14 day Williams %R of -51.85. The Williams %R fluctuates between 0 and -100 measuring whether a security is overbought or oversold. The Williams %R is similar to the Stochastic Oscillator except it is plotted upside-down. Levels above -20 may indicate the stock may be considered is overbought. If the indicator travels under -80, this may signal that the stock is oversold. Chart analysts may also use the indicator to project possible price reversals and to define trends.
Netflix Inc (NFLX) currently has a 14-day Commodity Channel Index (CCI) of 38.29. Active investors may choose to use this technical indicator as a stock evaluation tool. Used as a coincident indicator, the CCI reading above +100 would reflect strong price action which may signal an uptrend. On the flip side, a reading below -100 may signal a downtrend reflecting weak price action. Using the CCI as a leading indicator, technical analysts may use a +100 reading as an overbought signal and a -100 reading as an oversold indicator, suggesting a trend reversal.
One of the most famous sayings in the stock market is “buy low, sell high”. This may seem like an oversimplified statement, but there are many novice investors who often do the complete opposite. Many investors may be looking too closely at stocks that have been on the rise, and they might not be checking on the underlying fundamental data. They may be hoping to ride the wave higher, but may end up shaking their heads. On the flip side, many investors may hold onto stocks for far too long after they have slipped drastically. Waiting for a bounce that may never come can cause frustration and plenty of second guessing. Successful investors are typically able to locate stocks that are undervalued at a certain price. This may take a lot of practice and dedication, but it may do wonders for the health of the portfolio.

Source: Shutterstock Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is certainly scary for the traditional media industry. The company is the global power of the streaming market, which, along with NFLX stock, is likely to see long-term growth. During the latest quarter, the number of paid subscribers jumped by 5.3 million to 104 million and revenues rose by 30% to $2.99 billion. In light of this, it should be no surprise that NFLX stock has been one of this year’s hottest performers. So far, the return has been 56%. By comparison, old-line operators like Viacom, Inc. (NASDAQ:VIAB) and Discovery Communications Inc. (NASDAQ:DISCA) are off by double-digits. Yes, I have been a bull on NFLX stock for some time – and I haven’t changed this position. Yet I still think it is important to consider the risks. The tech world can be extremely volatile, as leaders can quickly crumble. OK then, what are some of the major issues for the NFLX stock price to consider? Well, let’s take a look at three: Over the years, NFLX has proven to be adept at fighting rivals. A prime example of this is how the company dealt with Blockbuster Video, which eventually went bust. But the streaming market is different. NFLX must fight against many players that have tremendous resources, like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL). In the meantime, there are various companies that are launching their own offerings, such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) and Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS). Oh, and international markets are also heating up, especially in Asia. Mega tech firms like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA) and Tencent Holdings Ltd (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) are making significant investments in streaming. These companies also have the advantage of massive user bases. A key part of the success of NFLX has been the focus on creating original content. The company has been able to spin-up successful programming like “Stranger Things” and “The Crown.” Next Page Article printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2017/11/nflx-stock-investors-ignore/. ©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC

Recent price movements in the stock of Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) have caught the attention of the investment community. Analysts often use price and volume data to predict future stock performance.

(NASDAQ:NFLX) in the last month has increased +0.85%. Shares are now up over the past year, outperforming the broad market by -100% and outperformed a peer group of similar companies by 140%. After the latest session, which saw the stock close at a price of $194.10, NFLX sits below its 52-week high. Netflix, Inc.

     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that NFLX may be headed in the future. In order to predict this, technical analysts look at momentum indicators, which measure the speed and magnitude of these price movements. The idea is that as momentum slows, it may signal the approach of key support or resistance levels and a reversal of recent trends. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for NFLX is 51.85%, which suggests that the stock is not particularly expensive or cheap, and not predisposed to a reactive price movement based on this measure. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 36.75%, tells a similar story, and suggests that NFLX currently trades in neutral territory. What do the trading volumes reveal? Volume patterns are useful for gauging the level of conviction behind price changes, and can be used to make predictions about future price movements. A sudden increase in a stock’s activity can be a sign that investors are trading in anticipation of a catalyst, or that investors feel very strongly in one way or the other about the future direction of a stock. Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) average trading volume of 5,189,195 during the past month is 19.97% below its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been less active than usual in the stock in recent times. What do the analysts think? NFLX is currently undervalued by -9.23% relative to the average 1-year price target of $213.84 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 2.20, which implies that analysts are generally neutral in their outlook for NFLX over the next year. How risky is the stock?  In order to put NFLX’s recent price performance into context, we need to get a sense of how the stock moves in relation to the overall market. Beta, which measures a stock’s price volatility relative to the market, provides the cleanest measure of systematic risk for a stock. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has a beta of 1.40, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are more extreme than the market as a whole. NFLX therefore has a above average level of market risk. During the past couple of weeks, NFLX average daily volatility was 18.55%, which is 13.9 percentage points lower than the average volatility over the past 100 days.

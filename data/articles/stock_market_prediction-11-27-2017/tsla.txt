 Per Reuters, Tesla Inc.TSLA has completed installing the world's largest lithium-ion battery in South Australia. The construction was completed within 55 days from Sep 29, when the grid connection deal was signed.
 In July, the company won a bid to construct 129 megawatt hour battery for Australia's most wind-energy dependent state i.e. South Australia. The company's CEO Elon Musk had pledged to install the battery within 100 days of signing the grid connection agreement. Otherwise the same would be given to the state for free.
 At the time of signing the deal, Tesla had already installed half the battery packs. Tesla Inc. Price and Consensus  Tesla Inc. Price and Consensus | Tesla Inc. Quote The company's powerpacks have been installed at a wind farm in France's Neoen and are undergoing testing to offer grid security services. Per South Australia Energy Minister, the battery will be operational from Dec 1.
 Of the total $390-million plan the state has sanctioned for diesel-fired generators to deal with frequent power cuts, it is yet to determine the amount to be paid to Tesla for the battery.
 The country's energy sector already notified that the power supply will be tight, mainly in South Australia and the neighboring state of Victoria, as one of the biggest coal power plants was shut down in March.
 Demand for lithium-ion batteries is expected to rise in the near future and the batteries are anticipated to be widely used in consumer electronic products as well as in electric cars to curb pollution.Price Performance

Steve Jobs gets a lot of credit -- deservedly so -- for making some of the most iconic tech products of the last 40 years and turning Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) into the most valuable public company in the world. His ability to see how Apple could make technology accessible and his obsession in controlling the entire technology ecosystem is uniquely Jobs. But it shouldn't be forgotten that it was really Tim Cook who made the vision a reality.  Jobs' story has a lot of parallels with Elon Musk, who has made Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) into the visionary company upending transportation and energy. He's given electric vehicles a viability they've never had and is now spreading disruption into semi trucks, solar energy, and energy storage. What Musk lacks today is his own Tim Cook, someone to take that vision from Musk's head to the production line. That could be a fatal flaw in disrupting the world.  Image source: Tesla. One of the underappreciated reasons the iPhone is the global phenomenon it is today, and the profit machine it is for Apple, is the product's supply chain. Apple designs the iPhone and all other Apple products, but contracts most of the supply chain. Scarce parts like memory and screens are secured from suppliers directly, sometimes years in advance, and assembly partners like Foxconn assemble the components into the iPhone. The complex process is like a symphony of disparate suppliers that are shipping parts around the world -- and Tim Cook is the conductor.  The real genius of Apple's supply chain is that the company can lean on its suppliers to build the manufacturing capacity Apple uses to grow. Cook doesn't have to build a Gigafactory; Foxconn does that for him.  It's hard to appreciate how important Cook's role was in launching products like the iPhone and iPad, which ended up revolutionizing how we use technology. If quality control wasn't right, the products could have gotten a bad reputation. If store shelves were understocked, customers could have gone elsewhere, and if they were overstocked, Apple could have been in a world of financial trouble. Inventory management is a knife's edge, and Cook has been the one walking that edge at Apple for nearly two decades.  There's no question Musk can design the same kind of amazing products that Jobs once did, but he hasn't proven the ability to produce those products on a mass scale or even industry standard quality. I think that is largely because there's not someone filling Tim Cook's role at Tesla.  Instead of sleeping on the production floor, something Musk likes to brag about, he should be laying out the strategy for Tesla and nurturing its culture and brand. An operational leader should be the one building an efficient manufacturing facility that can churn out cars, batteries, and solar panels with world-class efficiency.  If reporting on Tesla's operations is true, Tesla hasn't done enough of the hard work of building an efficient operation that it can build on. Workers putting parts on cars by hand, raw materials laying around the factory floor, and a production line moving at a snail's pace after the Model 3 is already launched aren't signs of an efficient operation. They're signs that Tesla is figuring out operations on the fly.  Tesla's inefficiency in operations isn't hyperbole, either. Inefficiency can be seen in inventory turns, which measures how many times inventory is turned into sales each year. You can see below that Ford (NYSE: F) and General Motors (NYSE: GM) both turn over their inventory more than twice as fast as Tesla.   TSLA Inventory Turnover (TTM) data by YCharts Tesla's manufacturing strategy seems to be problematic as well. Rather than planning out the supply chain ahead of time, Musk tends to lean on suppliers to make up for Tesla's shortfalls. Panasonic is the company really providing the technology and expertise to run the Gigafactory, and it was Panasonic that was brought in to save SolarCity's solar manufacturing operations as well.  As Bloomberg recently reported, Tesla is burning nearly half a million dollars in cash every hour, an unsustainable rate for any company. Its operations have to be improved to become a profitable company and live up to the hype it has generated thus far. I think that means Elon Musk needs his own version of Tim Cook to run Tesla's operations.  It's not unusual for successful companies to have both a visionary leader and an operational guru making the vision come to life. The qualities that make one successful rarely overlap into the other, which is why these relationships are symbiotic.  Today, you could argue that Apple's visionary/operational leadership has flipped from the Jobs days. Cook is an operational guy at the top, and he leans on Jony Ive and Craig Federighi to come up with the visionary products and technologies the company is making.  Tesla has the chance to be one of the most revolutionary companies of the century. If it can't get its operations right it may miss that opportunity, which would be a loss for all of us, not just investors.  10 stocks we like better than Tesla When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

http://fortune.com/2017/11/22/tesla-bitcoin-cash-burn-model-3/

It’s no secret that Tesla is burning through a lot of money at the moment—with the firm having only just increased its debut bond deal to finance production of the troubled Model 3, analysts are now warning that it will need to go looking for extra money to fund its other projects. But as for how quickly it’s burning cash, Bloomberg has come up with a startling figure: $8,000 a minute. That’s almost a bitcoin’s worth (the current value is $8,285) every 60 seconds, or $480,000 an hour. If Tesla (tsla) doesn’t bring in fresh funding, Bloomberg noted, its reserves will run dry in early August next year. That’s even slightly ahead of UBS’s recent prediction that the depletion would take four quarters. Tesla’s most recent gambit is to demand full upfront payments for the first 1,000 units of its upcoming Roadster sports car—a $250,000 car that may only be delivered in 2020. If it succeeds, that would be a handy $250 million to add to the pot, but probably not enough. The Model 3 is going through what Tesla CEO Elon Musk has called “production hell” due to bottlenecks in battery module assembly, apparently thanks to a systems integration subcontractor “dropping the ball.” The $35,000 Model 3 is the closest thing Tesla has got to its dream of electric cars for the masses, so it really needs to sell a lot of them if it is to recoup its $1 billion-per-quarter investment and finance other projects, such as the Roadster and the Tesla Semi truck.

 On today's episode of the Tech Talk Tuesday podcast, Ryan McQueeney discusses the Tesla TSLA Semi reveal and explains why lofty claims of Elon Musk should—sometimes—be taken with a grain of salt. Remember to subscribe and leave a rating on iTunes if you enjoy the show! Last week, Tesla and Musk unveiled the new Tesla Semi, which is the electric car giant's first entrance into the commercial vehicle industry. The event was hailed as the beginning of a new era in the world of trucking, but some particularly confounding "Musk-isms" have emerged in the wake of the unveiling. For one, Musk also revealed that Tesla is planning to release an updated version of its iconic Roadster. Many were quick to question why Tesla would redo a high-end model while it struggles to churn out its low-cost Model 3 cars, and this confusion only grew when Musk got to tweeting over the weekend. Indeed, in a pair of tweets, Musk seemed to imply that a version of the new Roadster might include rocket technology that would allow it to fly short distances. In an effort to prove that sometimes Musk says surprising things like this, Ryan took a closer look at some of the Tesla CEO's boldest claims in the past, eventually concluding that they could be a distraction method.

Tesla’s Musk (NASDAQ:TSLA) Latest Promises Break “The Laws of Batteries” $TSLA Elon Musk knows how to make promises and he know very well how not to deliver, smiling on the way to the bank. Even by his own standards, the promises made last week are monuments of envelope pushing. To deliver, according to close observers of battery technology, Tesla would have to far exceed what is currently know possible. His claims are so far beyond current industry standards for EV’s (electric vehicles) that they would require either advances in battery technology or a new understanding of how batteries are put to use. In some cases, experts think Tesla might be banking on technological improvements between now and the time when new vehicles are actually ready for delivery. Below at 4 of Tesla’s most provocative battery claims. as follows: Truck Range: Haul 80,000 Pounds for 500 Miles Last week when Elon Musk took the stage in an airport hanger in Hawthorne, California, his 1st proclamation was the Tesla Semi’s range: A fully-loaded truck would be able to travel at highway speeds for 500 miles.  The previous record-holder, unveiled by Daimler in October, is a truck that maxes out at 220 miles. Mr. Musk may be banking on battery improvements between now to the early 2020’s in order for its truck to make financial sense. The 1st Tesla Semis will hit the road until late Y 2019; if then and even then, production would probably start slowly. Most fleet operators will want to test the trucks before considering going all-in. By the time Tesla gets large orders, batteries may cost less. Lot of Big If’s here. Tesla Megachargers: 400 Miles in 30 Mins Mr. Musk’s claim that the truck will be able to accumulate 400 miles of charge in 30 mins would allow the Semi to achieve the 1st true long-haul ranges in the industry. A driver might start the day with 500 miles of range, top off the battery at lunch, and be able to complete driving the US legal limit of 11 hours in a day with range to spare. Doing this will require a charger unlike anything seen before. Tesla’s current generation of high-speed Superchargers have a power output of 120 kilowatts and can add about 180 miles to the battery in a Model S sedan in 30 mins. But that’s for a passenger car, not a loaded truck.  To meet Tesla’s claim of 400 miles in 30 mins for a semi carrying 80,000 lbs would require its new Megachargers to achieve output of more than 1200 kW—or more than 10X better than Tesla’s fastest chargers available today. If Tesla executes they have a very big opportunity. Another Very Big If. Guaranteed Charging Rates of 7 Cents per kWh The sticker price of any electric truck, regardless of size, is going to be higher than its diesel equivalent because of the batteries, which alone can cost as much as some standard diesel trucks. The $180,000 Tesla Semi will compete with diesels that cost as little as $100,000. The trick is to offset those higher upfront costs through lower maintenance and fuel savings. While the economics of such a plan vary by region, under any scenario Tesla will be heavily subsidizing those electricity rates for customers. He estimated that Tesla will pay a minimum of 40 cents per kilowatt hour, on average, for every 7 cents paid by a trucking company. There’s no way you can reconcile 7 cents a kilowatt hour with anything on the grid that puts a megawatt hour of energy into a battery. That does not exist. Tesla will likely go broke subsidizing ‘fuel’ to truckers. That may sound like a disastrous financial plan, but it’s no different from what Tesla does for its current Supercharger network. Tesla offers free electricity to most of its Model S and Model X customers while paying almost $1 per kilowatt hour to produce it. That amounts to a subsidy of as much as $1,000 per car in Y 2017. Many electric utilities base their commercial rates on the peak amount of electricity that a customer draws at one time, even if that peak occurs only for a brief period. Tesla’s Megacharger stations would incur extremely high charges by drawing so much power so quickly. The best chance for mitigating those charges are to build Megachargers at existing truck terminals that already draw a lot of power, and by adding massive battery packs that can spread demand over time. From another perspective, these subsidies to support Megachargers could be a boon to Tesla’s balance sheet as it wades into an entirely new industry. It allows the company to maximize its upfront revenue by charging a lot for the trucks while spreading out the cost of building and operating the charging network over time. But of course Musk will need billions more in investment cash and even more in government subsidies that would have to be legislated, and signed into law by President Trump, that is a Really Big If. A small 2 Roadster With a 620-Mile Range Tesla claims that its new $200,000 Roadster is the quickest production car ever made, clocking zero to 60 in 1.9 secs. But who really cares, Tesla cannot compete with Ferrari, Lamborghini, Aston Martin or Bugatti in that superfast, supercar market The car’s unprecedented battery range: some 620 miles on a single charge is longer range than any battery-powered EV on the road, nearly 2X as long as Tesla’s Model S and Model X. To achieve such power and range, Mr. Musk said the Roadster will need to pack a massive 200-kilowatt-hour battery. That is 2X the size of any battery Tesla currently has on the road. Mr. Musk has said he will not be making the packs bigger on the Model S and Model X because of space constraints. The Big Q: So how can he double the pack size in a very small Roadster? The Big A: The engineering problems for the battery-management system are virtually insurmountable, as the batteries required would be too large to fit in the small frame, it is not possible now. And true to his hypmeister style Tesla began taking deposits on the Roadster immediately, $50,000 for the base model, the 1st vehicles will not be delivered until Y 2020 if then or ever. The Semi Truck and Roadster promo last week raised many questions about Tesla’s battery capabilities and plans for expanding the markets in which electric vehicles are competitive. There are lots of Really Big Ifs Have a terrific weekend.   batteries, EV, Ferrari, fuel, laws, miles, Musk, roadster, semi, Tesla, truck, TSLA  Tesla’s Musk (NASDAQ:TSLA) Latest Promises Break “The Laws of Batteries” added by Paul Ebeling on November 24, 2017View all posts by Paul Ebeling →

@FredericLambert
 @FredericLambert Tesla’s stock (TSLA) fell back roughly 20 percentage points since hitting a new all-time high in September. Despite a series of major news about the company over the last few weeks, the stock has mostly been trading sideways as analysts and the market don’t seem to have a good grasp on the situation.

(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, one of the most popular analysts following Tesla, even released a note today predicting a roller-coaster ride for investors next year: “We expect Tesla shares to be extremely volatile in 2018, divided into two stages: (1) The alleviation of production bottlenecks with strong cash inflow, and (2) mounting concerns over the sustainability of the competitive moat. Tesla 2018: $400 then $200?” Basically saying that it could go either way, which is generally seen as a cop-out for analysts. In the short-term, Tesla’s success is still highly dependent on the Model 3 production ramp up. They invested billions at the Fremont factory and Gigafactory 1 in Nevada for the vehicle program. In order to start seeing returns on those investments, they need to start delivering the vehicle in volume. We have recently seen increasing evidence of continued deliveries from Tesla over the last few weeks, but nothing that would suggest a significant increase in production capacity. In his note to clients today, Jonas says that he expects Tesla to fix its battery module production issues, which is apparently the biggest production bottleneck at this point, “in the coming weeks.” Some are saying that Tesla’s event last week was a distraction from the Model 3 program, which could explain why the market didn’t go crazy, as some expected, following the event even though Tesla unveiled two new product lines. Electrek’s Take I personally don’t believe that the Tesla event last week was a distraction tactic. Those vehicle programs were in the works for a long time and way before Tesla had any idea what kind of issue would arise regarding Model 3 production. They even delayed the event last month officially to “focus on Model 3 production” among other things. I think they unveiled those products because the prototypes were ready and now they want to gauge the interests for those vehicles. With $5,000 deposits for the trucks and $50,000/$250,000 deposits for the new Roadster, those reservations will mean a lot in terms of interest and if they turn out to be popular again even following the Model 3 delays, it would be a giant confidence boost for Tesla. A few companies have already confirmed truck reservations and Tesla started taking Roadster reservations at the event. Even though the specs and design were impressive for almost everyone, it can still be difficult to understand just how significant those products can become. We would expect the company to potentially start releasing some of those reservation numbers as early as by the end of the week, which could definitely paint a clearer idea of the situation. Tesla is a transportation and energy company. It sells vehicles under its 'Tesla Motors' division and stationary battery pack for home, commercial and utility-scale projects under its 'Tesla Energy' division.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) revealed its semi-truck Thursday, and while parts of the big rig remain in shadow, its capacity for disruption is clear. Wall Street sees few positives for truck manufacturing rivals. Citigroup reiterated a Hold rating last week with with a $367 price target. Citigroup analyst Timothy Thein said the Tesla Semi's price, back-end support, battery capacity, recharging infrastructure and maintenance availability remain unknowns. Even some of the details Tesla explicitly outlined are uncertain, including its intended ability to charge for 7 cents per kilowatt-hour and to launch production in 2019, Thein said.  “Given start-up issues with certain of its (less complex) car models, we question if that timeline slips."  The Class 8 truck has “solid performance potential," such as a 500-mile range and quick acceleration ability, Thein said.  Fellow Citigroup analyst Christian Wetherbee said widespread adoption of electric semi-trucks such as Tesla's is still far off.  “Given the fragmentation of TL, we believe initial adoption could yield a margin advantage in certain lanes (drayage and other short haul applications), but if the technology was more widespread, we struggle to see the market maintaining price discipline and believe operators with lower cost bases would likely pass that along to shippers to drive market share,” Wetherbee said.  At the time of publication, Tesla was trading down 3.1 percent at a rate of $306.66.

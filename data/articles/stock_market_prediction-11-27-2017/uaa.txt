ANCHORAGE, Alaska (KTUU) The final buzzer has blown on the Great Alaska Shootout, with Central Michigan taking home the men’s tournament title in a nail-biting game. Chippewas winning 75 to 72 over Bakersfield, and are the 40th and final shootout champions.  Earlier in the day, UAA head coach Rusty Osborne took part in his 81st and final shootout game. The Seawolves men falling to College of Charleston 55 to 46. Jacob Lampkin had another impressive performance for the green and gold scoring 13 points and grabbing eight rebounds. Dimond High School alumni Eric Jenkins scoring his first college points of the season on a breakaway dunk to pull UAA within in one point in the second half. But the momentum seemed to take a turn after a Kylan Osborne's technical foul. Charleston would soon pull away with a big game from Joe Chealey. After the game coach Osborne shared his final thoughts on his last shootout. "We'll look back fondly on memories, and move on to the next phase of Seawolve basketball at Thanksgiving,” Osborne said. “People will appreciate it even more when it's gone, and will understand just because Duke and Kentucky aren't here, it’s still great basketball." In the third place game, Idaho takes down Cal Poly 75-66, Victor Sanders tallying 24 points in that game.  Sam Houston State also winning over Santa Clara 73-59 for seventh place.

 A resilient UAA women's basketball team never wavered when down eight points late in the GCI Great Alaska Shootout championship game Thursday, and the Seawolves sent the women's tournament out with a bang.  UAA rallied to defeat Tulsa 59-53 and claim the women's championship in front of 1,828 boisterous fans at the Alaska Airlines Center.  It was the seventh Shootout title for the Seawolves, their first since 2009, and the first for sixth-year coach Ryan McCarthy, whose team gets to keep the final gold pan championship trophy in Anchorage.  "It's just surreal," McCarthy said. "I'm just really proud of the ladies and I'm very proud of this particular one in general because it is the last one."  [At final Shootout, Coach McCarthy finally gets a championship]  Two Alaskans scored in double figures for UAA with junior forward Hannah Wandersee of Kodiak posting a team-high 14 points and seven rebounds and junior guard Tara Thompson of Dimond High tacking on 11 points and going 3 of 6 from 3-point land.  Tournament MVP honors went to forward Shelby Cloninger, who sank the go-ahead 3-pointer with 1:06 left on the clock.  A senior from Kamiah, Idaho, Cloninger scored six of her 13 points in the final 66 seconds, including a coast-to-coast layup and free throw that iced the game in the closing seconds.  Before hitting the 3, Cloninger was a measly 1 of 8 from the field, but Tulsa left her open on a UAA slip screen and she knew she had to shoot it.  "I was praying," Cloninger said. "I shot it and it went in and the crowd erupted. It was crazy."  Soon after that the Seawolves got a big traditional 3-point play from their shortest player, 5-foot-3 guard Sydni Stallworth.  The junior from Tucson, Arizona, received an inbounds pass on the baseline, made a layup while being fouled and made the ensuing free throw to increase UAA's lead to 56-51 with 12 ticks left on the clock.  "I was screaming at her not to shoot," McCarthy said. "All she had to do was dribble out, but Syd is a competitor. She stepped up and hit that and that was huge for us."  UAA led 32-27 at the half, but McCarthy said it felt like the Seawolves were down by five instead of up by five.  Tulsa cut into an 11-point UAA lead before halftime and took a 34-33 lead three minutes into the second half on a Crystal Polk jumper. The Golden Hurricane expanded its lead to 49-41 with just over six minutes left before UAA started its comeback.  As the Seawolves gained momentum, the crowd started to emerge from its post-Thanksgiving fatigue and chants of "UAA, UAA, UAA," resonated through the arena.  UAA forced four turnovers and held Tulsa to two points in the final four and a half minutes of the game.  "We take a lot of pride in our defense and I think that's what got us going," said sophomore guard Yazmeen Goo, who snagged four of UAA's 10 steals. "Since we put so much emphasis on our defense, it got us hyped when we started getting stops.  "I think that really helped with our momentum in the fourth quarter."  Tulsa coach Matilda Mossman said the turning point came right before Cloninger's big 3, when Tulsa guard Shug Dickson was called with a charge with 1:26 to go. Tulsa led 51-50 and the charge call took away a Dickson floater on the baseline that would have extended the Golden Hurricane lead.  "It changes the momentum of the game," Mossman said.  Tulsa played much of the game without second-leading scorer Kendrian Elliott, who struggled with foul trouble. The 6-foot-2 center finished with 11 points in 21 minutes.  Polk, Tulsa's other center, led the Golden Hurricane with 12 points and Dickson finished with 10.  Tulsa scored more points in the paint (36-22), but the Seawolves won the rebounding battle (40-30) against the larger team from American Athletic Conference.  Nine of 11 players scored for the Seawolves, who played without second-leading scorer Rodericka Ware, who was suspended for the tournament for a violation of team rules.  UAA's first tournament championship came in 1990 in the old Northern Lights Invitational, when the Seawolves had to beat three Division I teams to claim the title.  The next six championships, including Thursday's, came after the Northern Lights tournament ended and a four-team tournament for women became part of the Shootout. In that format, the Seawolves won titles in 2003, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009.  The Shootout continues through Saturday with men's competition. Saturday's 8 p.m. title game will mark the end of the 40-year-old tournament, the oldest regular-season college basketball tournament in the country.  Imani Watkins poured in 20 points to propel the Binghamton Bearcats to third place with a 68-51 victory over Maryland Eastern Shore.  Watkins, a 5-foot-8 senior guard, also racked up eight assists, six rebound and three steals. Alyssa James, a 6-1 senior center, added 15 points, seven rebounds and five blocks.  Binghamton raced to a 22-7 first-quarter lead over the Hawks, who were led by Bairesha Miles' 13 points and 10 rebounds.  2017 GCI Great Alaska Shootout All-Tournament Team Shug Dickson, Tulsa Yazmeen Goo, UAA Crystal Polk, Tulsa Hannah Wandersee, UAA Imani Watkins, Binghamton Most Outstanding Player: Shelby Cloninger, UAA

Polk ANCHORAGE, Alaska — Alaska-Anchorage outscored Tulsa 14-2 in the final 4 minutes, 10 seconds Thursday to pull out a 59-53 victory over the Golden Hurricane in the 40th annual Great Alaska Shootout at the Alaska Airlines Center. Crystal Polk led TU (3-3) with 12 points, Kendrian Elliott added 11, and Shug Dickson had 10 points and a team-best nine rebounds and four assists. Dickson and Polk were named to the all-tournament team. The Hurricane still led by one, 51-50, when Dickson scored but was called for an offensive foul. Coach Matilda Mossman said that was the turning point in the game. “It came down to the charge call at the 1:26 mark,” Mossman said. “We had a one-point lead, Shug (Dickson) makes a basket but is called for the foul, and Alaska-Anchorage finishes with a 9-2 run. “I am proud of the way we weathered the storm when we were down 11, but UAA played really hard and played with urgency in the end.” There were eight lead change and seven ties. Alaska-Anchorage (7-0), ranked No. 2 in NCAA Division II, was led by Hannah Wandersee with 14 points. Tulsa will return to action at 7 p.m. Wednesday against Oral Roberts in the Mayor’s Cup game at the Donald W. Reynolds Center.

FAIRBANKS — The University of Alaska Fairbanks men’s and women’s Nordic ski team fell to in-state rival Alaska Anchorage in the 14th annual Nordic Cup on Sunday afternoon at Hatcher’s Pass.  UAA finished the two-day event in 4 hours, 49 minutes and 49.4 seconds, while UAF posted a total time of 4:56:10.5. On Sunday, the Seawolves’ mixed gender relay team of Marte Hakenstad-Braten, Hailey Swirbull, Tracen Knopp and Toomas Kollo won the 4x5-kilometer relay in 1:04:42.8 at the independence Mine Trails. The Nanooks’ mixed gender relay team consisting of Anna Darnell, Ann-Cathrin Uhl, Jan Cech and Arnaud Guyon took second, finishing the event in 1:04:59.5 Alaska Anchorage also finished third in 1:06:21.0, though Alaska’s second relay team, which features Anja Maijala, Hannah Dueling, Seiji Takagi and Max Donaldson, took fourth in 1:06:28.7. On Saturday, the rivals competed in the individual-start 10/7.5km classic race. The Seawolves’ top men’s team captured first in the 10km with a time of 88:23.6, while the Nanooks’ top squad finished in 88:50.4. Anchorage’s top three women tallied a time of 70:22.0 in the 7.5km, and Alaska’s completed the course in 75:51.9. “I’ve got to give credit to UAA and their coaching staff because they have a much stronger team than what we’ve faced in recent years, especially on the women’s side,” Nanooks head coach Nick Crawford said Saturday in UAF news release. “Their last two years of recruiting have been very successful and I expect that they’ll have a very good season ahead.” Alaska’s men were led by redshirt senior Jan Cech, who took second among college skiers and third overall with a time of 20:19.5. Senior Seiji Takagi (29:41.0) finished fifth overall and classmate Alexander Eckert (29:49.9) captured seventh. In the women’s race, Uhl finished sixth overall after completing the 7.5km course in 24:54.8. Kati Roivas (24:59.2) and Darnell (25:57.9) finished seventh and 10th overall, respectively.  The Nanooks will return to the trails after Christmas break, as they’ll compete in the U.S. Cross Country National Championships on Jan. 3 and 5 at the Kincaid Park Trails in Anchorage.  Contact News-Miner sports writer Brad Joyal at 459-7530.

https://www.adn.com/sports/uaa-athletics/2017/11/23/of-the-6-titles-earned-by-uaas-women-none-was-bigger-than-the-first/

 Originally published on Nov. 23, 2010.  Forget turkey and cranberries and Cowboys and Lions. The UAA women's basketball team has its own Thanksgiving tradition, one that frays nerves and fills trophy cases all at the same time.  We're talking about the team's knack for pulling out close victories in the championship game of the Carrs/Safeway Great Alaska Shootout year after year.  When the Seawolves play for a Shootout championship, history tells us to expect drama. And not just the drama of David beating Goliath, the go-to analogy whenever Division II UAA beats a Division I team. It's the drama of David beating Goliath at the buzzer.  UAA's four straight Shootout titles, won under the guidance of coach Tim Moser, have come by a grand total of nine points.  Add a three-point victory in the 2003 championship game when Jody Hensen was in her first season as coach and the one-point win in the 1990 Northern Lights Invitational championship game when Linda Bruns was in her final season as coach, and the UAA women have claimed six tournament championships by a mere 13 points.  This year marks the 20th anniversary of UAA's first championship, which is also its greatest, because it came back when the women hosted an eight-team tournament. These days, the women host a four-team tournament.  In 1990, the Seawolves had to beat three Division I teams before they could cut down the nets and accept the commemorative watches given to each player on the championship team.  The three wins came by a total of five points. In the championship game, Greta Fadness — one of the most accurate shooters in Seawolves history — sank a free throw with one second left to lift UAA to an 88-87 win over a South Alabama team fueled by 45 points from All-American Adrian Vickers.  A frenzied crowd of nearly 1,000 packed UAA's Sports Center for the game.  Jodi Bellamy was a guard for that season's Seawolves. She lives in Idaho now — she just became a grandmother — and recently visited former teammate Wendy Sturgis, who had the unhappy task of guarding Vickers. Their conversations included memories of their Northern Lights championship.  "What I remember is Greta making that free throw and the fact we won those three games by (five) points," said Bellamy, 47. "I remember the loudness of the crowd, and I remember it was so great to get the watches. It was really cool to be standing there, getting to be the ones who got the watches."  Kelly Mullican Kowal, UAA's center, was on the bench when Fadness shot the winning free throw.  "I remember grabbing my teammate and almost nail biting," she said. "I can picture to this day Linda in her stance, screaming."  Neither Kowal nor Bellamy could believe it when South Alabama put Fadness on the line. A slender redhead from North Dakota, Fadness set UAA's career and single-season records for 3-point shooting, and she was deadly from the foul line.  "Of all the people to foul," Bellamy said. "We were like, yay! yay! They fouled her!"  Kowal, who teaches language arts at Romig Middle School, said just being in the championship game was huge. Winning it was beyond huge.  "The first thing that comes to mind is just how excited we were just to be in that game, to know the opportunity was there and within our reach," she said. "To win it, it was like we had won the NCAAs. It was a packed house — friends, family, people from out of state — and there was the excitement of a small arena."  Each of UAA's subsequent tournament championships has come in a four-team field at Sullivan Arena, but the smaller field and less-intimate arena hasn't lessened the thrill for the Seawolves.  And the Seawolves still haven't figured out a way to win a tournament title in the first 38 minutes of the game instead of the last two.  Beth Bragg is the ADN sports editor.

ANCHORAGE (KTUU) - The UAA women's volleyball team will make its fifth-straight appearance in the NCAA tournament, the Association announced Monday. The Seawolves have made the postseason four out of the past five seasons, but waited eagerly in a conference room Monday to see if they would earn an at-large bid to the 2017 NCAA tournament. The team learned that they made the cut, and will enter the tournament as a 7 seed in the West Region, facing fellow GNAC team Western Washington. The West region tournament will be hosted at California Baptist University in Riverside California Nov. 30 - Dec. 2. The Seawolves' season ended on a low note with a loss to Montana State-Billings at home, finishing the season with a 19-10 overall record and 14-6 in the Great Northwest Athletic Conference.

 The UAA volleyball team is back in the NCAA tournament.  The Seawolves on Monday received the No. 7 seed for the eight-team NCAA Division II West Region championships.  The tournament berth is the fifth straight and eighth in nine years since Chris Green became UAA's coach in 2008.  The Seawolves (19-10) will face longtime conference rival Western Washington (25-3) in a first-round match on Thursday, Nov. 30, in Riverside, California.  UAA lost twice to the Vikings this season in Great Northwest Athletic Conference play. Both matches went four sets.  Western Washington is the No. 2 seed behind Cal Baptist (28-0), the top seed and tournament host.  In other first-round games, No. 3 Northwest Nazarene (24-4) will play No. 6 Central Washington (19-9); Cal Baptist will face No. 8 Sonoma State (20-8); and No. 4 Cal State San Bernardino (21-7) will play No. 5 Azusa Pacific (22-6).  UAA is the defending West Region champion and last season's national runner-up.  The Seawolves were able to continue their postseason streak despite losing two starters who broke team rules earlier in the season and despite losing their regular-season finale last week.  The winner of the tournament will advance to the national quarterfinals Dec. 7-9 in Pensacola, Florida.

 The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For WMT, the company currently has $7.03 Billion of cash on the books, which is offset by $9.02 Billion current liabilities. You can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $18.89 Billion over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to fall in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $1.35 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 32.56% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors. Technical Analysis Sometimes, we can understand most about a stock by simply looking at how it has been trading. Looking at the stock’s movement on the chart, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. recorded a 52-week high of $100.13. It is now trading 3.72% off that level. The stock is trading $85.93 its 50-day moving average by -10.48%. The stock carved out a 52-week low down at $65.28. In recent action, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) has made a move of +8.96% over the past month, which has come on weak relative transaction volume. Over the trailing year, the stock is underperforming the S&P 500 by 17.88, and it’s gotten there by action that has been less volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange.

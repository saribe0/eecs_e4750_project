In the year-to-date period, shares of Cupertino based iPhone maker, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) have rallied by over 50%. While this is a massive rally for any company, but, given the size of Apple Inc, this rally is even more impressive. Apple Inc added close to $285 billion in market cap this year alone. On the other hand, Apple's revenues have grown by 6% in FY 17 and net profit grew by 5.8%. So, what is driving the Apple stock rally? A hope of an iPhone supercycle. Analysts are expecting Apple revenues to grow by a massive 19.6% in FY 2018, largely driven by the recently launched flagship iPhone X. AAPL stock is part of Amigobulls' top stocks to buy portfolio which has outperformed the Nasdaq Composite.  However, there are many who believe the rally in AAPL stock has gone too far and iPhone sales may come below expectations. Investors have already started betting against Apple stock. In the latest fortnight, short interest in Apple stock jumped by a massive 28%, indicating a significant rise in bearish sentiment. The total number of shorted shares increased from 33.49 million to 42.83 million, an increase of over 9 million shares. Surging short interest in Apple stock indicates that investors are expecting a correction in the near term. There are a couple of reasons for the rising short interest. Firstly, some investors believe that AAPL stock is trading at very rich valuation multiples and secondly, iPhone sales may not be able to meet the street's expectations. The year-long run-up in AAPL stock price has driven the valuation multiples higher. Apple stock's trailing PE has risen from 13.4x a year back to 19x now and PS (ttm) has gone up by 70% in the last one year from 2.7x to 3.9x. This rapid expansion in Apple's valuation multiples has several investors worried. Research firm Instinet advises caution as the valuation multiples for Apple stock have hit seven year high. A one point contraction in PE multiple will lead to $9 or 5% correction in the stock. The risk/reward proposition on the stock is less compelling now than it has been a year ago.  Of course, this wouldn't be a concern if Apple is able to deliver strong growth. And many expect Apple to deliver better than expected growth in FY 18 driven by the strong demand for iPhone X. However, recent reports by some analysts have been skeptical when it comes to iPhone Supercycle. A recent report was cautious when it came to iPhone sales estimate. According to the survey of some 6,700 people in five regions, conducted by UBS, an increasing number of people are willing to pay more for a smartphone. This is a good news for Apple as its latest iPhone models are pricier than previous models. However, the survey also found that intent of purchasing a smartphone was flat to down compared to previous year. The report also stated that in China, which is a significant market for Apple, consumers are likely to purchase local brands rather than Apple. If the above scenarios turn out to be true then AAPL stock could definitely see a correction. However, you must look at the above report with a pinch of salt. The survey was conducted before the iPhone X was available in the stores for customers to check it out. There are several anecdotal reports and surveys which indicate the demand for iPhone X remains quite strong. Even Instinet analysts who are cautious due to Apple's valuation multiples expect a strong demand for iPhone as they find iPhone appears to be selling out everywhere without any promotions from the carriers. The Instinet report states that "TMUS noted that the X has seen great demand and better supply than anticipated. Both TMUS and VZ expect X demand to spill into March. Fewer promos likely recognize the telcos are selling all they have." Apple had also witnessed massive pre-order demand for the iPhone X in late October. And iPhone usage data from Mixpanel indicates that iPhone X adoption has improved by over 50% in the last two weeks. iPhone X sales will be the main driver for Apple stock in the near term. Any indication of slacking demand could lead to a correction. So, investors must remain cautious. However, the fourth quarter earnings report presented a strong picture of Apple's business. The company is delivering strong performance on several fronts. iPad sales are growing again. For the second consecutive quarter, iPad sales showed double-digit YoY growth. This was also the best year ever for Mac, with the segment reporting highest annual revenue in Apple's history. And for the third consecutive quarter, Apple Watch unit sales grew by over 50% YoY. Then there is the services segment which includes revenue from AppleMusic, AppleCare, Apple Pay, licensing and other services. Over the last five years, the services segment has grown at a CAGR of over 23%. It will continue to grow at a rapid pace in the coming years. The best part of this segment is its high margins. According to an estimate by Piper Jaffray, the services segment has a gross margin of around 60%. Considering that the services segment already contributes 13% of Apple's revenue and this share will continue to grow in the future, Apple could see an expansion in its profit margins. The rising profitability could easily support higher multiples. Looking for fundamentally strong tech companies like Apple Inc to invest in?

Source: Shutterstock The holiday shopping season is in full swing, and that means shoppers will be filling their carts with lots of shiny new phones, tablets, PCs and other assorted gadgets. So, while I have my reservations about Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) longer-term outlook, now is not the time to bet against AAPL stock as the company is a key purveyor of sought-after holiday gifts. Fundamentally, AAPL’s stock price is riding a wealth of positive sentiment it gained from its most recent quarterly earnings report. iPhone sales were stronger than expected, while Macs and iPads saw a resurgence in demand. Apple has also addressed production issues for the iPhone X to ensure that shoppers have plenty of the hottest new iPhone to fill their stockings. That’s not to say that there still aren’t production concerns. The Apple HomePod will not make it to shelves in time for the holiday shopping season, leaving Amazon.com, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Echo and Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Home to dominate the market space. Furthermore, if you’re looking for a more stable long-term bet, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has proven considerably more reliable of late than AAPL stock. 
Click to EnlargeThat said, sentiment remains as strong as ever on AAPL stock. For instance, Thomson/First Call reports that 33 of the 45 analysts following AAPL stock rate the shares a “buy” or better, with no “sell” ratings at all. Furthermore, the consensus 12-month price target rests at $187.74 — a premium of only about 7.3% to AAPL’s current trading range. There is still room for a bit more “holiday cheer” for Apple, in the form of both upgrades and price-target increases, especially if sales remain robust throughout the holiday shopping season. On the options front, AAPL stock speculators are also heavily bullish on the shares. Currently, the December put/call open interest ratio is at 0.55, with calls nearly doubling puts among front-month options. Peak call OI totals more than 56,000 contracts at the out-of-the-money $180 strike, with about 48,000 contracts open at the just overhead Dec $175 call.

Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) 2017 iPhone launch season has been a roller coaster ride so far, and it seems that won’t be changing anytime soon. The iPhone X, which had been showing 5-6 week delivery times since selling out almost immediately at release, is now available in just 1-2 weeks.   Having shipping times dramatically improve just three weeks after it first went on sale sets off alarm bells. Is iPhone X availability the result of cratering demand?  If so, it goes without saying that would be bad news for AAPL stock. However, an analyst report released on Friday says the additional supply is actually the result of production improvements. That’s good news for Apple investors who had been disappointed that manufacturing issues have seriously impacted iPhone X availability, likely de-railing the expected iPhone super cycle and in turn holding back AAPL stock. When the new flagship iPhone was first available for pre-order on Oct. 27, estimated iPhone X shipping times quickly slipped to 5-6 weeks. They’ve been like that ever since. That has caused some hand wringing among AAPL investors, who have been counting on the iPhone X as the key driver of an iPhone upgrade super cycle. After all, you can’t have record iPhone sales if there are no iPhones available to sell. But late last week, iPhone X availability improved to a 1-2 week timeframe. That sudden improvement was potentially worrisome, because it could indicate that just three weeks after launch, demand had dropped for the iPhone X.  MacRumors got a copy of a report on the issue from KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, and it appears to be all good news for Apple and AAPL stock investors. According to Kuo, the sudden improvement in iPhone X availability is because a production bottleneck has been resolved — not weakening demand.  You may recall the many reports leading up to the launch of Apple’s new smartphone about manufacturing challenges. In particular the dot projector — a component of the TrueDepth camera system that enables Face ID — was proving to be a challenge. At one point, Apple was rumored to have eased up on requirements for this component to improve yields, although the company quickly denied doing so (and there was no subsequent improvement in iPhone X availability).

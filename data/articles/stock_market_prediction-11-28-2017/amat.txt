Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT) is an interesting player in the Technology space, with a focus on Semiconductor Equipment & Materials. The stock has been active on the tape, currently trading at $57.91, up from yesterday’s close by 0.40%. Given the stock’s recent action, it seemed like a good time to take a closer look at the company’s recent data. Fundamental Analysis Does this stock stack up well when compared to its peers in the industry space? Let’s take a look. Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT) currently trades with a market capitalization of $62.02 Billion. That value represents a market adjusting for revenues that have been growing by 20.38 % on a quarterly year/year basis as of the company’s last quarterly report. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For AMAT, the company currently has $5.01 Billion of cash on the books. You can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $3.27 Billion over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to grow in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $0.98 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 82.33% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors. Technical Analysis It’s important to check the technicals to get a sense of how AMAT has been acting. Looking at the stock’s movement on the chart, Applied Materials, Inc. recorded a 52-week high of $60.89. It is now trading 2.98% off that level. The stock is trading $53.80 its 50-day moving average by -4.11%. The stock carved out a 52-week low down at $29.85. In recent action, Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT) has made a move of +3.54% over the past month, which has come on weak relative transaction volume. Over the trailing year, the stock is underperforming the S&P 500 by 17.96, and it’s gotten there by action that has been more volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. In terms of the mechanics underlying that movement, traders will want to note that the stock is trading on a float of 1.01% with $1.06 Billion sitting short, betting on future declines. That suggests something of the likelihood of a short squeeze in shares of AMAT.

Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) shares are up more than 79.45% this year and recently increased 0.40% or $0.23 to settle at $57.91. Oclaro, Inc. (NASDAQ:OCLR), on the other hand, is down -21.28% year to date as of 11/24/2017. It currently trades at $7.05 and has returned 10.77% during the past week. Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) and Oclaro, Inc. (NASDAQ:OCLR) are the two most active stocks in the Semiconductor Equipment & Materials industry based on today’s trading volumes. Investors are clearly interested in the two names, but is one a better choice than the other? We will compare the two companies across growth, profitability, risk, valuation, and insider trends to answer this question. Growth One of the key things investors look for in a company is the ability to grow earnings at a high compound rate over time. Analysts expect AMAT to grow earnings at a 16.82% annual rate over the next 5 years. Comparatively, OCLR is expected to grow at a 14.00% annual rate. All else equal, AMAT’s higher growth rate would imply a greater potential for capital appreciation. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Profitability and Returns Growth doesn’t mean much if it comes at the cost of weak profitability. To adjust for differences in capital structure we’ll use EBITDA margin and Return on Investment (ROI) as measures of profitability and return. , compared to an EBITDA margin of 25.14% for Oclaro, Inc. (OCLR). AMAT’s ROI is 24.40% while OCLR has a ROI of 27.80%. The interpretation is that OCLR’s business generates a higher return on investment than AMAT’s. Cash Flow  
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 If there’s one thing investors care more about than earnings, it’s cash flow. AMAT’s free cash flow (“FCF”) per share for the trailing twelve months was +0.43. Comparatively, OCLR’s free cash flow per share was +0.15. On a percent-of-sales basis, AMAT’s free cash flow was 3.15% while OCLR converted 0% of its revenues into cash flow. This means that, for a given level of sales, AMAT is able to generate more free cash flow for investors. Liquidity and Financial Risk Balance sheet risk is one of the biggest factors to consider before investing. AMAT has a current ratio of 2.90 compared to 3.90 for OCLR. This means that OCLR can more easily cover its most immediate liabilities over the next twelve months. AMAT’s debt-to-equity ratio is 0.61 versus a D/E of 0.01 for OCLR. AMAT is therefore the more solvent of the two companies, and has lower financial risk. Valuation AMAT trades at a forward P/E of 13.18, a P/B of 7.11, and a P/S of 4.27, compared to a forward P/E of 11.16, a P/B of 2.18, and a P/S of 1.94 for OCLR. AMAT is the expensive of the two stocks on an earnings, book value and sales basis. Given that earnings are what matter most to investors, analysts tend to place a greater weight on the P/E. Analyst Price Targets and Opinions Just because a stock is cheaper doesn’t mean there’s more value to be had. In order to assess value we need to compare the current price to where it’s likely to trade in the future. AMAT is currently priced at a -15.14% to its one-year price target of 68.24. Comparatively, OCLR is -26.41% relative to its price target of 9.58. This suggests that OCLR is the better investment over the next year. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 1.80 for AMAT and 1.80 for OCLR, which implies that analysts are equally bullish on their outlook for the two stocks. Risk and Volatility Beta is an important measure that gives investors a sense of the market risk associated with a particular stock. A beta above 1 signals above average market risk, while a beta below 1 implies below average volatility. AMAT has a beta of 1.84 and OCLR’s beta is 1.39. OCLR’s shares are therefore the less volatile of the two stocks. Insider Activity and Investor Sentiment Comparing the number of shares sold short to the float is a method analysts often use to get a reading on investor sentiment. AMAT has a short ratio of 1.05 compared to a short interest of 6.91 for OCLR. This implies that the market is currently less bearish on the outlook for AMAT. Summary Oclaro, Inc. (NASDAQ:OCLR) beats Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) on a total of 8 of the 14 factors compared between the two stocks. OCLR is growing fastly, higher liquidity and has lower financial risk. In terms of valuation, OCLR is the cheaper of the two stocks on an earnings, book value and sales basis, OCLR is more undervalued relative to its price target. Finally, KLAC has better sentiment signals based on short interest.

Latest evolution in the price of Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) stock has been one of the most talked about matter among the interested investors. Analysts often use price and volume data to predict future stock performance. In the case of AMAT, the chart has some interesting things to say about where the stock might be headed. How has the stock performed recently? Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) in the last month has increased +3.54%. Shares are now up over the past year, outperforming the broad market by -100% and outperformed a peer group of similar companies by 133%. After the latest session, which saw the stock close at a price of $57.91, AMAT sits below its 52-week high. Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) has been trading in a bullish manner, based on the relative positions of the stock’s 20 and 200 day moving averages. Momentum indicators 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that AMAT may be headed in the future. Fortunately, there is way to use the speed and magnitude of these price changes to predict future performance, thanks to what are known as momentum indicators. As momentum slows, it might be a sign that a support or resistance level has been reached, and that a trend is about to reverse. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for AMAT is 60.62%, which suggests that the stock is not particularly expensive or cheap, and not predisposed to a reactive price movement based on this measure. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 48.55%, tells a similar story, and suggests that AMAT currently trades in neutral territory. What do the trading volumes reveal? Analysts use volume trends to assess the level of conviction behind a stock’s price changes. When volumes suddenly increase above normal levels, it can be a sign that investors feel very strongly in one way or the other about the future direction of a stock, or may even have access to inside information. Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT) average trading volume of 9,933,809 during the past month is 0.3% below its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been less active than usual in the stock in recent times. What do the analysts think? AMAT is currently undervalued by -15.14% relative to the average 1-year price target of $68.24 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 1.80, which implies that analysts are generally bullish in their outlook for AMAT over the next year. How risky is the stock?  No study on the valuation of a stock is complete without taking into account risk. When analyzing the systematic risk associated with a stock, analysts look at beta, which measures the stock’s volatility relative to the overall market. Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) has a beta of 1.84, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are more extreme than the market as a whole. AMAT therefore has a above average level of market risk. During the past couple of weeks, AMAT average daily volatility was 28.16%, which is -0.36 percentage points higher than the average volatility over the past 100 days.

 Measuring Applied Materials Inc’s (NASDAQ:AMAT) track record of past performance is a useful exercise for investors. It enables us to understand whether or not the company has met or exceed expectations, which is an insightful signal for future performance. Today I will assess AMAT’s recent performance announced on 29 October 2017 and weigh these figures against its long-term trend and industry movements. Check out our latest analysis for Applied Materials   I use data from the most recent 12 months, which annualizes the latest 6-month earnings release, or some times, the latest annual report is already the most recent financial data. This blend enables me to examine many different companies on a similar basis, using the most relevant data points. For Applied Materials, the most recent earnings is $3,434M, which, relative to the prior year’s level, has risen by an impressive 99.89%. Since these values may be fairly nearsighted, I’ve computed an annualized five-year value for AMAT’s net income, which stands at $1,281M. This shows that, on average, Applied Materials has been able to steadily improve its bottom line over the last couple of years as well.   Applied Materials’s track record can be a valuable insight into its earnings performance, but it certainly doesn’t tell the whole story. While Applied Materials has a good historical track record with positive growth and profitability, there’s no certainty that this will extrapolate into the future.

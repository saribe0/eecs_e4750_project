 TOKYO — Another pillar of Japanese industry admitted falsifying quality data on Tuesday, as Toray Industries Incorporated, a manufacturer of materials like carbon fiber, said one of its subsidiaries had for years been providing clients with false product-test reports. The subsidiary, Toray Hybrid Cord, makes cord-like materials used to strengthen car tires and other objects. Toray said it had identified 149 instances in which Toray Hybrid Cord altered data after internal tests showed its cords failed to meet manufacturing standards demanded by customers. Toray said it had sold products with falsified test data to 13 customers. It declined to name those customers but said the deception did not involve parts supplied to Boeing, to which Toray is an important provider of lightweight carbon-fiber components used in aircraft bodies. The deception, which Toray said took place between 2008 and 2016, echoed similar practices admitted in recent weeks by Kobe Steel and Mitsubishi Materials. Together, the revelations have embarrassed a country that has built its economic reputation on reliable, high-quality manufacturing. Advertisement The revelations appear to be creating a kind of snowball effect. Toray said it became aware of the problem in July 2016 but had not disclosed it widely because there was no threat to public safety. Toray Hybrid Cord’s products met basic safety standards, Toray said, so the car tires and other items that incorporate them do not need to be recalled or replaced. Advertisement But Toray’s chief executive, Akihiro Nikkaku, said Toray decided to go public in part because of the added scrutiny and the pressure created by the Kobe Steel and Mitsubishi Materials disclosures. He added that partial information about the Toray Hybrid Cord issue had begun to leak online, posted by anonymous sources that he presumed to be Toray employees, and that the leaks had helped to force Toray’s hand.

View all New York Times newsletters. “Rather than have it come out as rumor we thought it was better to announce it publicly,” Mr. Nikkaku said at a news conference on Tuesday. Toray’s share price fell more than 5 percent on Tuesday. While Toray is not a well-known name outside Japan, its importance to the global supply chain and its influence in Japan are considerable. Growing demand for carbon fiber from a range of industries has turned Toray into a crucial supplier for many companies. Its former chief executive, Sadayuki Sakakibara, is now the chairman of Keidanren, the influential business organization that lobbies on behalf of Japan’s largest companies. On Monday, before Toray’s revelations, Mr. Sakakibara warned at a news conference that deceptive quality-reporting practices by Japanese companies threatened to undermine trust in the nation’s manufacturing. “It’s a grave situation,” Mr. Sakakibara said, adding that any discrepancies between the actual and promised specifications of a manufactured product “should in principle be made public as soon as they are discovered.” Manufacturers often ask suppliers to produce components to even higher specifications than legally required. Like Kobe Steel and Mitsubishi Materials previously, Toray said that when quality inspections revealed that products from Toray Hybrid Cord fell short of those standards, workers sometimes faked inspection data to make it appear as though the products met them. No deaths or product failures have been attributed to the false data. Japanese carmakers have also been hit by revelations that they cut corners in their quality controls. Nissan and Subaru acknowledged last month that they had been allowing workers who lacked certifications required by Japanese regulators to inspect vehicles produced for the Japanese market.

Staff Writer More corporate misconduct by yet another major Japanese firm emerged Tuesday as Toray Industries Inc. said its group falsified quality test data. Toray Hybrid Cord Inc., an Aichi-based subsidiary of Toray and maker of tire and other industrial reinforcement cords, said it identified 149 cases out of 40,000 in which two employees in charge of quality assurance modified figures.

 In these cases, which occurred between 2008 and 2016, the strength of the materials did not meet the standards promised to customers. The products include tire and vehicle hose reinforcement cords as well as cords used during a paper manufacturing process. The leading Japanese textile maker said the misconduct affects 13 companies but stressed that the doctored figures were close to the quality standards, so the products pose no safety or functional risks. The firm said the two workers had consistently poor compliance in meeting promises with customers, so they altered the figures to meet the standards. Toray President Akihiro Nikkaku said the firm has been investigating its other business groups and there are 137 other suspicious cases. He said the probe is close to an end. Nikkaku said the firm plans to implement measures including a computerized data management system for product quality to prevent data tampering. “We are taking this issue very seriously,” Nikkaku said during a news conference at the firm’s headquarters in Tokyo. “I’m profoundly sorry for causing so much trouble,” he said. “In the next three years, we are committed to creating a product quality data system that won’t allow misconduct” and make sure that its workers won’t make the same mistake. Toray said it discovered the data falsification in July last year. But it did not prepare to go public until earlier this month when the firm noticed an internet post regarding the misconduct and received some inquiries. Nikkaku said it thought it would be better for his company to address the issue openly rather than let rumors run rampant. Data falsification problems that have recently dogged other major companies, such as Kobe Steel Ltd. and Mitsubishi Materials Corp., prompted Toray to disclose its case as well, he said. Had there been no internet post and scandals by other companies, Toray would not have announced the case publicly, since the misconduct did not violate related laws or jeopardize safety, Nikkaku said, adding that the firm would have informed its client companies to square the issue. After the announcement, Toray’s shares plummeted 5.3 percent to close Tuesday trading at ¥1,046 on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Toray is known as a textile and material supplier to companies like Uniqlo and Boeing, and its former president, Sadayuki Sakakibara, currently serves as chairman of Keidanren, one of Japan’s largest business lobbies. Nikkaku said products for Uniqlo and Boeing are unaffected by the scandal.

								 TOKYO -- Corporate Japan's credibility hit another low after Toray Industries, one of Japan's biggest materials manufacturers, joined a list of companies admitting to falsifying data. Toray announced on Tuesday it had uncovered 149 cases of data fabrication at its subsidiary, Toray Hybrid Cord, in three products sold to tire companies and autoparts makers: tire cords, cords for car hose belts and cords for paper making. The subsidiary made the products look as though they met customer requirements. The company said that 13 domestic and overseas companies, including at least one South Korean company, are affected. In a statement, Toray maintained that the "amount by which the data was adjusted to fit customer contract standards was insignificant." The company believed there were no safety issues involved. Toray Hybrid Cord discovered the problem during a July 2016 internal compliance check, with Toray president Akihiro Nikkaku being informed of the matter the following October. Explaining why it took more than a year to disclose the falsification, Nikkaku said at a news conference in Tokyo on Tuesday morning that the company would usually not have revealed such data falsification, as there were no safety concerns or violations of law. He added that Toray would normally settle the matter with customers privately. However, Nikkaku said: "We found a post on the internet in early November [2017] that said our subsidiary was falsifying data, and we had some of our shareholders and customers contacting us about the issue. In order to clarify the situation, we decided it was best to go public." Nikkaku also revealed that Toray was in the midst of conducting a group-wide investigation into other possible malpractices, and that there were still 137 cases remaining to be examined. As well as supplying fabrics to casualwear manufacturer Uniqlo, Toray also provides carbon fiber to Boeing. "I believe that there are no irregularities in our products to big customers like Boeing or Fast Retailing," Nikkaku said, referring to the U.S. aircraft maker and Uniqlo's parent. Japan Inc. tarnished Toray's admission is the latest in a series of data falsification scandals that have engulfed Japan's materials manufacturers in recent months. Kobe Steel admitted to falsifying data in early October, while Mitsubishi Materials came forward last week and said it had been doing the same at three of its subsidiaries. But Toray's admission may have wider repercussions since the company is home to Sadayuki Sakakibara, current chairman of the Japan Business Federation, or Keidanren, Japan's biggest business lobby. It was only on Monday during a regular news conference that Sakakibara had said he was "very disappointed" by Mitsubishi Materials' data rigging, and that the string of scandals was "a serious situation that could affect trust in Japanese companies." Toray's data falsification started in 2008 while Sakakibara was president of the company. Nikkaku noted that Sakakibara was made aware of Toray's falsification after Monday's news conference, and that he was requested to "deal with the situation sincerely." Toray's shares plunged on Tuesday, ending the day at around 1,046, down 5.3% from Monday's close.

Further ReadingUber hit with 2 lawsuits over gigantic 2016 data breachIt has now been a full week since the jaw-dropping revelations that Uber sustained a massive data breach in 2016, which affected more than 57 million people. Since November 21, the company has been hit with 10 federal lawsuits (including the two Ars reported on last week). On Monday, the city of Chicago and Cook County also sued Uber in Illinois state court, while numerous senators are now demanding answers as well. The cases allege substantial negligence on Uber’s part: plaintiffs say the company failed to keep safe the data of the affected 50 million customers and 7 million drivers. Uber reportedly paid $100,000 to delete the stolen data and tried to keep news of the breach quiet by having the hackers sign non-disclosure agreements. In the case of City of Chicago v. Uber, city and Cook County lawyers wrote that in October 2016, then-CEO Travis Kalanick was contacted by two hackers who claimed to have millions of individual Uber customers’ records. "In striking resemblance to the 2014 breach, the hackers had accessed a private GitHub repository and found database login credentials," Chicago's attorneys argued. Further Reading50,000 Uber driver names, license numbers exposed in a data breach"While the repository was password-protected, hackers were still able to breach it—indicating either a very weak password or the fact that the user credentials for the repository were found in a previous unrelated data breach. And even though Uber specifically promised regulators that it would use two-factor authentication on services like GitHub, it clearly failed to implement that promise. Once inside the GitHub repository, the attackers once again found AWS login credentials, which the attackers then used to access and extract the personal information of over 50 million people, including Chicago and Illinois residents." Last Tuesday, CEO Dara Khosrowshahi wrote: "None of this should have happened, and I will not make excuses for it." According to The Wall Street Journal, Khosrowshahi learned of the breach two weeks after he took over the company’s top job on September 6, and, yet, he kept quiet for more than two months. Chicago attorneys also wrote that the company’s claim that the stolen data has been fully expunged is "nonsensical." "It has not demonstrated, in any way, how or why it knows the data was actually deleted," they wrote. "No matter what documents the hackers signed, or representations they made, Uber is saying little more than that they trust the word of criminals." Further ReadingHackers hit Uber in 2016: data on 57 million riders, drivers stolenThe broadly similar 10 proposed class-action suits were filed in several federal courts across the country: in San Francisco; Los Angeles; Allentown, Pennsylvania; Portland; Chicago; and even Huntsville, Alabama. On Monday, a group of senators, led by Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) and Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), specifically asked for a "detailed timeline" of the incident, among other demands due by December 11. Similarly, Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) also had an even more damning question: "To the extent Uber had lawfully acquired information enabling it to identify the hackers who had compromised its systems, ensure they would abide by agreements to delete the data and not to disclose the breach, and transfer them $100,000, it conceivably had enough information at hand to assist law enforcement in the apprehension of these criminals," he wrote. "Why did Uber choose not to provide relevant forensic information to law enforcement and has this information been provided to law enforcement in the last week?" Uber spokeswoman Molly Spaeth sent a statement to other media, including the Chicago Tribune, which read: "We are committed to changing the way we do business, putting integrity at the core of every decision we make, and working hard to regain the trust of consumers." Uber has not responded to Ars’ multiple requests for comment. 

http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-uber-chicago-lawsuit-20171127-story.html

The city of Chicago and Cook County on Monday filed a lawsuit against Uber Technologies, alleging the ride-hailing company’s 2016 data breach harmed “tens, if not hundreds, of thousands” of area residents. San Francisco-based Uber disclosed last week that the personal data of 57 million customers and drivers globally were exposed last year, and that it had paid hackers $100,000 to keep quiet about stealing the personal information. Uber waited more than a year to disclose the data breach, and that delay, in addition to failing to protect consumers’ personal information, violates city and state laws, according to the lawsuit filed in Cook County Circuit Court. Uber also faces lawsuits filed by consumers over the issue, and attorneys general in several states, including Illinois, are investigating the breach. The company also said last week it was contacted by the Federal Trade Commission. In August, Uber agreed to adopt a privacy program to settle an earlier FTC complaint that the company improperly protected consumer data. The hackers in last year’s attack allegedly exploited “virtually the same security flaw” attackers had used before, the Chicago-Cook County lawsuit states. Among other requests, the lawsuit asks the court to fine Uber $10,000 for each violation of its ordinance involving a Chicago resident for each day the violation existed. Uber spokeswoman Molly Spaeth said in a statement that the company takes the matter seriously and will answer regulators’ questions. “We are committed to changing the way we do business, putting integrity at the core of every decision we make, and working hard to regain the trust of consumers,” she said. amarotti@chicagotribune.com Twitter @AllyMarotti RELATED Uber is sued over massive data breach after paying hackers to keep quiet » Uber reveals cover-up of hack affecting 57 million riders, drivers » The last straw?

VMware and Amazon Web Services are beefing up capabilities of their joint attack on the enterprise hybrid cloud market – called VMware Cloud on AWS -- including a new disaster recovery-as-a-service offering for enterprises with on-premises data centers and a new availability region. The two companies, which launched the cloud service in August with initial availability in Amazon cloud’s US West region (hosted in data centers in Oregon), announced today that they have expanded the service to AWS US East region in Northern Virginia – the cloud leader’s largest (and still relentlessly expanding) availability region in terms of data center capacity. Related: Google and Cisco Signed the Papers, and Now Starts the Heavy Lifting They made the announcements at the AWS re:Invent 2017 conference taking place this week in Las Vegas. VMware and AWS also announced several new add-on services to speed application migration to the cloud, a new option to use the cloud service as a second data center for disaster recovery, as well as improved scalability, security, and visibility for mission-critical and cloud-native applications. Related: QTS and Amazon Package Hybrid Cloud as a Colo Service For example, the cloud service – which essentially enables customers to spin up VMware environments in AWS – initially supported only several hundred virtual machines (VMs). In the coming months, it will support 32-host clusters and up to 10 clusters per software-defined data center, meaning a single enterprise customer can use VMware Cloud on AWS to support tens of thousands of VMs, said Ivan Oprencak, director of product marketing at VMware. The announcement fulfills a promise that VMware made to add new cloud capabilities every quarter, he said. “It’s a significant amount of capabilities that we’ve made available to our customers in a very short time frame and enables compelling use cases that our customers are demanding,” Oprencak said. VMware and AWS partnered a year ago to deliver the cloud service to enterprise customers who wanted to embrace a hybrid cloud model and seamlessly move applications to the public cloud. VMware Cloud on AWS includes VMware’s core server virtualization platform vSphere, its network virtualization platform NSX, VMware VSAN for storage virtualization, and the VMware vCenter management suite. All top contenders for share of the enterprise cloud market, including AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, IBM, and Oracle, are ramping up their hybrid cloud capabilities, both through partnerships and by developing native capabilities. Its partnership with VMware, which is ubiquitous in the enterprise, is at the core of Amazon’s efforts on that front. “The partnership gives AWS a hybrid story,” Owen Rogers, research director at 451 Research’s Digital Economics unit, said. “Years ago, the message from AWS seemed to be that the public cloud was enough, but over the past couple of years they seem to have accepted that enterprises like the option for both public and private cloud.” VMware Site Recovery as a new add-on cloud service bolsters business continuity and disaster recovery. It allows enterprises with on-premises data centers to replicate their VMs and data to VMware Cloud on AWS. If their main data center goes down, they can failover to VMware on AWS and keep their applications running with a simple click of the mouse, Oprencak said. Customers can also use the VMware Site Recovery service to back up one VMware Cloud on AWS environment to another AWS availability zone. Oprencak said the offering provides enterprises an easier way to bolster disaster recovery without the expense of having to build and manage a second data center themselves. “Disaster recovery-as-a-service is our most popular use case,” he said. “When a disaster strikes, you can fail over to VMware Cloud on AWS, and if you need more resources, you can dynamically add more nodes. And once the disaster is over, you can fail back to your on-premise data center. Everything is re-replicated, so you have the same state you had on VMware Cloud on AWS. And you can scale back down to the minimal footprint that you need to maintain replication.” The Site Recovery service is the most interesting new capability, Rogers said. “VMware on AWS’s whole value proposition is based on hybridity, and resilience across different cloud models is an important part of the story,” he said. “I like that you can choose to protect some workloads and not others. It’s a bit like an insurance policy on your wedding ring, but not on that tacky watch your grandmother left you.” AWS’s biggest competitor Microsoft Azure as a similar DR-as-a-Service offering, Rogers added. To newly announced application migration and portability service is called VMware Hybrid Cloud Extension. It is an add-on Software-as-a-Service offering on VMware Cloud on AWS. It allows large-scale workload migration into the cloud while allowing customers to keep the same networks, IP, and routing policies in place, the companies said. To further simplify application migration and portability, they also announced plans to make VMware vMotion (which allows for live migration of VMs) available via AWS Direct Connect, Oprencak said. Direct Connect enables customers to connect their corporate networks to AWS through private links instead of via the internet. “When they use vMotion, they don’t have to change their network configuration, and with AWS Direct Connect, they get a dedicated private link and the performance they need to do that work,” he said. Also now available is Wavefront by VMware -- a cloud service that allows enterprise customers to monitor their VM infrastructure and get better visibility on their CPU and network usage, Oprencak said. Finally, VMware announced a Hybrid Loyalty Program, offering one- and three-year subscriptions for VMware Cloud on AWS – which it said can lower prices by up to 50 percent compared to on-demand pricing The VMware Site Recovery service is available immediately. VMware vMotion, Hybrid Cloud Extension, support for AWS Direct Connect, and multi-cluster support will be available during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, which ends on Feb. 3, 2018, the companies said.

To newly announced application migration and portability service is called VMware Hybrid Cloud Extension. It is an add-on Software-as-a-Service offering on VMware Cloud on AWS. It allows large-scale workload migration into the cloud while allowing customers to keep the same networks, IP, and routing policies in place, the companies said. To further simplify application migration and portability, they also announced plans to make VMware vMotion (which allows for live migration of VMs) available via AWS Direct Connect, Oprencak said. Direct Connect enables customers to connect their corporate networks to AWS through private links instead of via the internet. “When they use vMotion, they don’t have to change their network configuration, and with AWS Direct Connect, they get a dedicated private link and the performance they need to do that work,” he said. Also now available is Wavefront by VMware -- a cloud service that allows enterprise customers to monitor their VM infrastructure and get better visibility on their CPU and network usage, Oprencak said. Finally, VMware announced a Hybrid Loyalty Program, offering one- and three-year subscriptions for VMware Cloud on AWS – which it said can lower prices by up to 50 percent compared to on-demand pricing The VMware Site Recovery service is available immediately. VMware vMotion, Hybrid Cloud Extension, support for AWS Direct Connect, and multi-cluster support will be available during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, which ends on Feb. 3, 2018, the companies said.

On a chilly Tuesday morning from Boston, Aaron in for Adam today. It was tweeted repeatedly yesterday, after news broke that David Karp, the founder of Tumblr, was leaving the free-wheeling blogging site that’s now owned by Verizon via its recent acquisition of Yahoo. “Tech history: Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg acquired Instagram for $1 billion in 2012. Yahoo’s Marissa Mayer bought Tumblr for $1.1 billion in 2013,” noted CNBC’s Tae Kim, in one typical tweet. Tech history won’t have many good things to say about the Tumblr acquisition. The site’s anything-goes ethos, with a heavy serving of porn, was always an odd fit with Yahoo’s more mature audience and advertising base. Though Karp stayed, he and his new Yahoo overseers never found a way to sell much advertising on the platform or keep it growing at a rapid pace. And they fumbled the transition to mobile. Before disappearing into Verizon and its new Oath media unit, Yahoo had written off the value of two-thirds of the purchase price. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. The story of Instagram at Facebook is almost the exact opposite. Mark Zuckerberg didn’t just keep CEO Kevin Systrom, but also allowed Systrom to direct the platform’s future. Instagram stayed focused on mobile users and turned into a perfect platform to host sponsored posts. In weighing the best acquisitions of all time, the investing-oriented web site Benzinga placed Instagram second behind only Google’s $1.65 billion purchase of YouTube in 2006. Karp gave no hints about possible future projects on his way out. “I beg you to understand that my decision comes after months of reflection on my personal ambitions, and at no cost to my hopefulness for Tumblr’s future or the impact I know it can have,” Karp wrote in a letter to his employees that he also posted on his Tumblr blog. “The internet is at a crossroads of which this team can play a fundamental role in shaping.” The more interesting story to follow won’t be what happens to Tumblr, though. It will be how Karp next tries to shape the the future. (Full disclosure: I worked for a few years at Yahoo Finance, but had little or nothing to do with Tumblr.) Don’t tread on me. Airbnb, Reddit, Etsy, Twitter and many other Internet companies (don’t forget Tumblr, too) asked the Federal Communications Commission not to kill the agency’s 2015 net neutrality rules. “This would put small and medium-sized businesses at a disadvantage and prevent innovative new ones from even getting off the ground,” the group wrote in a comment letter. Terms and conditions. Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son is looking for a bargain before he invests in Uber. Son’s SoftBank Group will lead an investment of $1 billion at Uber’s most recent $69 billion valuation, but then wants to pick up $6 billion of stock from current shareholders at a 30% discount, Bloomberg reports. Meanwhile, Uber execs are on a global tour to reassure regulators. “We have changed tacks in so many ways in dealing with regulators, dealing with governments,” Brooks Entwistle, Uber’s chief business officer for Asia Pacific, tells Reuters. And back in the United States, Alphabet’s Waymo self-driving car unit asked a a judge to delay a case over trade secrets it filed against Uber, which is scheduled to start December 4. Machine life saver. Facebook thinks it may have developed an algorithm that can save lives. The AI program seeks to detect signs a user may be suicidal and then warns friends or first responders, if needed. “We can help connect people who are in distress connect to friends and to organizations that can help them,” Guy Rosen, Facebook’s vice president of product management, tells TechCrunch. Rocket man. Elon Musk’s SpaceX raised another $100 million, extending a financing effort from this summer that had already raised $350 million, according to a regulatory filing. That fundraising values the company, which wants to send a manned mission to Mars in 2024, at $21.5 billion. And, in other Musk news, the billionaire entrepreneur says he definitely did not invent bitcoin. If you build it. Amazon introduced a set of software tools on Monday called Amazon Sumerian to help programmers write virtual reality and augmented reality apps using 3D computer graphics. Apps made with Sumerian will be compatible with some VR headsets, like the Rift and HTC Vive, as well as on Apple products like the iPhone and iPad. Android compatibility is coming soon. One more thing. Oh yeah, bitcoin just crossed $10,000. A few dozen of the bids to host Amazon’s HQ2 have been made public and Seattle Times columnist Danny Westneat has been reading what’s available so far. Most are filled with the usual array of tax breaks and promised infrastructure improvements. But Fresno, Calif. is willing to go farther, giving a committee made up of half Amazon employees and half government appointees say over how taxes should be spent. A spokesman for the city said the plan would avoid taxes “disappearing into a civic black hole.” But as Westneat retorts: “It feels like a dicey moment for the ‘civic black hole.’ Also known as democracy.” Why Students Should Leave Their Laptops Closed During Class By Sarah Gray Apple May Be Eyeing a Foldable iPhone By Jonathan Vanian A Top Hedge Fund Manager Says Bitcoin Could ‘Easily’ Hit $40,000 by the End of 2018 By Joseph Hincks Crooks Cash in Stolen Rewards Points for Flights and Hotels By Jeff John Roberts This Might Be the Biggest Cyber Monday in History: Here’s Why By Chris Morris Why Wall Street Is Getting Worried About Apple’s Stock Price By Aaron Pressman If you live almost anywhere along the east coast, then you have probably driven on Interstate 95, though hopefully not often.

GE Healthcare, a subsidiary of General Electric Co. (GE), is set to use Nvidia Corp.’s (NVDA) chips in an artificial intelligence (AI) platform to improve the speed and accuracy of CT and ultrasound scans. In a joint statement on Monday, the two companies revealed plans to strengthen their already 10-year long partnership by installing Nvidia's chips in GE Healthcare's Revolution Frontier CT platform and 500,000 imaging devices across the globe. Using Nvidia’s chips, the AI-equipped devices are said to be two times faster than the previous generation image processor and capable of delivering lower radiation doses, faster exam times and higher quality medical imaging. GE Healthcare, one of conglomerate GE’s most profitable areas of business, said the speedier Revolution Frontier technology should help to reduce the number of follow-up appointments and non-interpretable scans as it is better equipped to detect liver and kidney lesions. (See also: GE Cuts Its Dividend By 50% to $0.12.) Under the terms of the deal, GE Healthcare will also use Nvidia’s graphics processing units, CUDA computing platform and cloud registry to power its new analytics platform. The company said that an average hospital generates 50 petabytes of data annually, but that only 3 percent of that data is analyzed, tagged, or made actionable. "Healthcare is changing at remarkable speed, and the technologies that will transform the industry should reflect that pace," said Kieran Murphy, president and CEO of GE Healthcare. "By partnering with Nvidia, GE Healthcare will be able to deliver devices of the future — intelligent machines capable of empowering providers to improve the speed and accuracy of diagnoses for patients around the world." Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, added: “Our partnership with GE Healthcare brings together great expertise in medical instruments and AI to create a new generation of intelligent instruments that can dramatically improve patient care.” (See also: AI Is NVIDIA's to Lose, Says Jefferies, Upping PT.) GE Healthcare’s use of Nvidia’s chips represents another big coup for the Santa Clara, California-based company. Nvidia’s AI technology has already been introduced across a number of fields, including self-driving cars, robotics and video analytics. These breakthroughs have led the company’s stock to soar over the past year. (See also: Why NVIDIA's Valuation May Be A Giant Bubble.)

 Nvidia has announced a major new partnership with GE Healthcare, the health arm of US giant GE, to develop new and advanced AI-powered tools and services. The company has around 500,000 medical imaging devices in operation around the globe, and is now looking to create and develop smarter and more effective tools using the power AI technology. Nvidia has been at the forefront of AI technology through its extensive GPU hardware line, which is also used in areas such as robotics and self-driving cars.  The company will now look to work with GE Healthcare to supply GPU-accelerated deep learning solutions as part of a new Applied Intelligence platform to further patient care and medical applications.  This includes designing more sophisticated neural networks for healthcare and medical applications — from real-time medical condition assessment to point-of-care interventions to predictive analytics for clinical decision-making.  Patients will also be able to benefit from a number of advances in the healthcare, including lower radiation doses, faster exam times and higher quality medical imaging. “Healthcare is changing at remarkable speed, and the technologies that will transform the industry should reflect that pace,” said Kieran Murphy, President and CEO of GE Healthcare. “By partnering with NVIDIA, GE Healthcare will be able to deliver devices of the future – intelligent machines capable of empowering providers to improve the speed and accuracy of diagnoses for patients around the world.” “Our partnership with GE Healthcare brings together great expertise in medical instruments and AI to create a new generation of intelligent instruments that can dramatically improve patient care,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia.

By Dan Haar Caption Close Listening to General Electric CEO John Flannery talk about paring back the company’s ambitions, it’s hard not to think he would have kept the headquarters in Connecticut, the state where he grew up. Does that matter now that GE flies its flag in Boston? Probably not, but it’s one way to think about how deeply Flannery — raised in West Hartford — deplores the pretension and overreach Jeff Immelt showed as CEO for 16 years. Look past Flannery’s halving the dividend, grounding the corporate jet fleet and shedding $20 billion in assets as he focuses the industrial businesses on three main areas — health care, aviation and power generation. His main message: Let’s stop trying to be what we are not, and return to a culture of excellence and execution, basic blocking and tackling. Immelt did simplify an unwieldy GE. But his Big Idea was that GE could revolutionize the world with unifying software that could take trillions of points of data and turn it all into smart action — not just for GE businesses but for the entire world. The move to Boston was a piece of that striving. Immelt tried to redefine GE from an industrial-financial behemoth to a fast-moving tech disrupter, and a ubiquitous one, to use the word of analyst Nicholas Heymann at William Blair & Co. Two big problems: First, the burn rate of cash on assets that didn’t show results. In the digital platform alone, Heymann points out, GE’s cumulative outlay grew from $1.5 billion in more than four years through 2015, to $6.6 billion by the end of 2017. That included training what would have totaled tens of thousands of independent developers to write apps for GE’s systems. And that was just one place where GE was spending wads of cash without immediate returns. The spending was done in the name of becoming, yes, ubiquitous in a global industrial economy that runs on software upgrades and ongoing maintenance contracts, not mechanical advances and repairs. “The reality of the cost of achieving that began to sneak in,” Heymann said. Heymann rates GE as a stock that will outperform because he believes Flannery can succeed in “narrowing the scope,” of digital ambitions to serve GE businesses and core customers rather than the whole world. “This isn’t just a GE phenomenon,” Heymann said. “GE just happened to take a path that was acute in using cash.” That brings us to the second problem with Immelt’s Big Idea that Flannery is curtailing. Although GE has long built software into its products, it could never become the pure software development company Immelt imagined. Sukhmander Grewal, a former longtime GE technology executive and developer who now heads Veoci, a New Haven software company, was among many people who held that view two years ago. Back then, Immelt was winning praise for his expansive vision, including the Boston move. Shares traded over $30. Grewal called the idea unrealistic in 2015. At least four times since the 1930s, Grewal points out, GE has tried and failed to pioneer a computing revolution — including, for example, the wave of factory automation in the ‘80s. “There has been widespread skepticism that GE can compete with independent software products on their own,” Grewal said Monday. As for Immelt’s ambition, he said, “The problem wasn’t that it was a conglomerate ... the investment decisions and the direction of the C-suite were in retrospect misguided.” Flannery has now confirmed that skepticism. So far, the market isn’t on board with his plan to dig out. GE shares closed at $18.12 Monday on the New York Stock Exchange — down 40 percent for the year and barely changed since a 12.5 percent decline after Flannery cut the dividend on Nov. 14. None of this means GE is out of the game of disruptive innovation. Potential game-changing advancements include a strong additive manufacturing in its new generation of jet engines, for example. And Predix, the industrial data analytics platform, is making strides in some industries, Heymann said. “GE is in good stead as it relates to, quote unquote, critical new technologies,” he said. Flannery even sounded downright effusive at times in his Nov. 14 restructuring presentation. “The world is fundamentally going to run on the back of GE, it’s going to move on the back of GE, it’s going to heal on the back of GE,” Flannery said. “There’s still incredible things going on inside the GE businesses…We’ll end up inventing a future that no one frankly can imagine right now like we have always done.” Still, he’s fundamentally a pragmatist, not a dreamer. It’s a fair guess he would not have thought the 2016 headquarters move to Boston from Fairfield was worth the bother, as GE has no shortage of development sites around the world. In Connecticut, GE now has fewer than 3,000 employees, down from 7,000 in 2006 and 5,700 three years ago. The headquarters move cost a couple of hundred jobs with the vast bulk of the decline coming from the breakup of GE Capital. Flannery has delayed the Boston buildup. He isn’t likely to return the head office to Connecticut — but he should, Grewal said. “It would send a message that GE is back to reality,” Grewal said. “He doesn’t need to be on the cover of Wired magazine.” dhaar@hearstmediact.com

General Electric Company (GE) is an interesting player in the Industrial Goods space, with a focus on Diversified Machinery. The stock has been active on the tape, currently trading at $18.19, up from yesterday’s close by 0.22%. Given the stock’s recent action, it seemed like a good time to take a closer look at the company’s recent data. Fundamental Analysis Money managers are always interested in a company that can find the right recipe of fundamental data because it reflects something important going on underneath the surface. General Electric Company (GE) currently trades with a market capitalization of $157.62 Billion. That value represents a market adjusting for revenues that have been growing by 14.38 % on a quarterly year/year basis as of the company’s last quarterly report. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For GE, the company currently has $39.85 Billion of cash on the books, which is offset by $28.13 Billion current liabilities. You can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $-2.01 Billion over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to fall in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $0.31 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 61.16% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors. Technical Analysis No analysis is ever complete without a thorough survey of a stock’s technical behavior. Looking at the stock’s movement on the chart, General Electric Company recorded a 52-week high of $32.38. It is now trading 14.19% off that level. The stock is trading $21.97 its 50-day moving average by 3.78%. The stock carved out a 52-week low down at $17.46. In recent action, General Electric Company (GE) has made a move of -14.68% over the past month, which has come on Strong relative transaction volume. Over the trailing year, the stock is underperforming the S&P 500 by 17.96, and it’s gotten there by action that has been more volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. In terms of the mechanics underlying that movement, traders will want to note that the stock is trading on a float of 1.17% with $8.66 Billion sitting short, betting on future declines. That suggests something of the likelihood of a short squeeze in shares of GE.

We last reviewed Action Alerts PLUS holding General Electric (GE) in the middle of November, and prices have stabilized a little. Back on Nov. 14, we said, "The volume of trading in GE is heavy and that can be a sign that some traders and investors are throwing in the towel. That can sometimes signal a climax low is being seen, but it is too early to tell. The $17.75 and $17 levels are likely to be key to GE's intermediate-term future." With the announcement that Nvidia (NVDA)  -- also an Action Alerts PLUS holding -- and GE will be extending their 10-year partnership by bringing artificial intelligence tools to medical imaging, another look at the charts and indicators on GE seems to be in order.   In this daily bar chart of GE, above, we can see a little light at the end of the tunnel. Prices are still well below the declining 50-day and 200-day moving average lines, but notice the heavy turnover in the middle of the month -- 300 million shares of volume could be considered a "throw in the towel" event. Prices have not rebounded much, but the 12-day momentum study shows a bullish divergence with a higher low in the second half of this month compared to a lower low in price. This bullish divergence is not big but it appears to be working for now.   In this weekly bar chart of GE, above, we can see a steep decline from $30 in April down to $18 this month. This is not a classic 50% retracement, but not all declines pay attention to percentages. Prices are below the declining 40-week moving average line -- maybe too far below. The weekly OBV line remains in a downtrend and the weekly Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is still in a bearish mode.   This updated Point and Figure chart of GE, above, shows a small breakout from a small double top at $18.31. A nearby price target of $19.05 is projected. Bottom line: A few weeks ago, the price action was a remake of Chicken Little, but now there is a glimmer of hope for General Electric.

https://economicsandmoney.com/2017/11/27/what-the-technicals-say-about-general-electric-company-ge-7/

Over the last few days fluctuation in the stock of General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) was the main talking point of investors. Many experts agree that the truth about a stock is best reflected in the way it moves on the chart. For this stock, the chart has a lot to say about future performance. How has the stock performed recently? General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) in the last month has decreased -14.68%. Shares are now up over the past year, outperforming the broad market by -100% and outperformed a peer group of similar companies by 1952%. After the latest session, which saw the stock close at a price of $18.19, GE sits below its 52-week high. General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) has been trading in a bearish manner, based on the relative positions of the stock’s 20 and 200 day moving averages. Momentum indicators 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that GE may be headed in the future. If we want to get a sense of GE’s future performance, we have to look at the speed and size of these price movements. Using what are known as momentum indicators, we can use the stock’s price momentum to get a sense of whether the stock is in the midst of, or nearing the end of, a current trend. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for GE is 28.31%, which suggests that the stock may be primed for a trend reversal or a breakout to the upside. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 17.32%, tells a similar story, and suggests that GE currently trades in oversold territory. What do the trading volumes reveal? Volume patterns can also be useful for predicting future performance. When trading activity is abnormally high, it’s often a sign that the market feels particularly strong in one way or another about the future direction of a stock. General Electric Company (GE) average trading volume of 95,977,695 during the past month is 107.68% above its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been more active than usual in the stock in recent times. What do the analysts think? GE is currently undervalued by -20.91% relative to the average 1-year price target of $23.00 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 2.40, which implies that analysts are generally neutral in their outlook for GE over the next year. How risky is the stock?  In order to put GE’s recent price performance into context, we need to get a sense of how the stock moves in relation to the overall market. Beta, which measures a stock’s price volatility relative to the market, provides the cleanest measure of systematic risk for a stock. General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) has a beta of 1.12, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are more extreme than the market as a whole. GE therefore has a above average level of market risk. During the past couple of weeks, GE average daily volatility was 42.45%, which is -15.65 percentage points higher than the average volatility over the past 100 days.

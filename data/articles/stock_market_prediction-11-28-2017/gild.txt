It has been more than a month since the last earnings report for Gilead Sciences, Inc. GILD. Shares have lost about 7.9% in that time frame, underperforming the market. Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts. Gilead’s HCV Sales Weak, Earnings Beat Gilead reported third quarter 2017 results wherein both earnings and revenues surpassed expectations. The company’s third-quarter earnings (including the impact of stock-based compensation expenses) of $2.27 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.09. However, earnings were below the year-ago quarter figure of $2.75. Moreover, total revenues of $6.5 billion topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.3 billion. However, revenues declined 13.2% year over year. HIV Impresses Yet Again, Harvoni & Sovaldi Plunges Product sales came in at $6.4 billion, down 13.5% year over year. The decline was due to lower hepatitis C virus (HCV) sales, partially offset by higher sales across HIV and other therapeutic areas. Antiviral product sales, which include Gilead's HIV and liver disease portfolio, came in at $5.8 billion in the reported quarter, down 14.7%. HCV product sales, which include Harvoni, Sovaldi, Epclusa and Vosevi, were $2.2 billion, down from $3.3 billion reported in the year-ago quarter. The downside was mainly attributed to lower sales of Harvoni and Sovaldi across all major markets, partially offset by sales of Epclusa (launched in 2016) and sales of Vosevi (approved in the United States and Europe in July 2017). Sales of Harvoni declined 47.7% year over year to $973 million in the reported quarter. Further, Sovaldi sales recorded a steep year-over-year decline of 73.4% to $219 million. Epclusa garnered sales of $882 million in the reported quarter, up from the year-ago figure of $640 million. We note that Epclusa was launched in the U.S. and Europe in June and Jul 2016, respectively. Meanwhile, HIV and HBV product sales came in at $3.6 billion, up 16.1% year over year. The increase was primarily driven by continuous strong uptake of tenofoviral afenamide (TAF)-based products such as Genvoya, which generated sales of $988 million, up from $461 million in the year-ago quarter, Descovy, which recorded sales of $316 million, up from $88 million, and Odefsey, which registered sales of $296 million, up from $105 million. HIV treatments like Stribild and Complera/Eviplera sales declined 63.1% and 42.3% respectively. Viread sales were down at $274 million, down 9.6%. Atripla sales tanked 32.4% to $439 million, while Truvada sales fell 5.5% to $811 million. Other products like Letairis, Ranexa, AmBisome and Zydelig recorded sales of $213 million (down 0.9%), $164 million (down 3.5%), $92 million (up 1.1%) and $40 million (up 2.5%), respectively. Research & development (R&D) expenses declined 24% to $745 million. On the other hand, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 3.3% to $806 million. Adjusted product gross margin was 87.2% compared to 87.6% in the year-ago period. 2017 Guidance Updated Gilead now expects net product sales in the range of $24.5-$25.5 billion, up from $24.0-$25.5 billion provided earlier. Non-HCV product sales are projected between $16 billion and $16.5 billion (earlier projection: $15.5 billion and $16 billion). HCV product sales are projected between $8.5 billion and $9.0 billion (earlier projection: $8.5 billion and $9.5 billion). Adjusted R&D expenses and adjusted SG&A expenses are now projected in the range of $3.3-$3.4 billion and $3.3-$3.4 billion, respectively. Adjusted product gross margin is expected in the range of 86-87%. Earnings per share are now projected around $1.02-$1.17 (earlier projection: 86-93 cents). Kite Acquisition The company recently acquired Kite Pharma. Last week, the company received FDA approval for Yescarta, a CAR-T therapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy. Dividend and Share Repurchase Concurrently, Gilead declared a cash dividend of 52 cents per share of common stock for fourth-quarter 2017. The dividend is payable on Dec 28 to stockholders of record at the close of business on Dec 15. During the quarter, the company paid cash dividends of $682 million and repurchased shares for $153 million. How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then? Following the release and in the last month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There has been one revision lower for the current quarter. Gilead Sciences, Inc.

Quote VGM Scores At this time, Gilead's stock has a poor Growth Score of F, however its Momentum is doing a lot better with a B.

Shares of Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) observed rebound of 12.45% since bottoming out on Jun. 16, 2017. Meanwhile, due to an ongoing pressure which caused a decline of almost -1.02% in the past five days, the stock price is now up 0.13% so far on the year — still in weak territory. In this case, shares are down -16.89% , the 52-week high touched on Sep. 08, 2017, but are collecting gains at -4.96% for the past 12 months.  Brokerage houses, on average, are recommending investors to hold Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD)’s shares projecting a $85.14 target price. Analysts‟ target price forecasts are a prediction of a stock‟s future price, generally over the 12 months following the release date (Asquith et al., 2005). This forecast is a point estimate that provides investors with a benchmark against which to directly compare stock price in the short run.Target prices made by analysts employed by large brokers, who have access to a greater resource pool, are more likely to be met over the 12-month forecast period.  GILD’s revenue has grown at an average annualized rate of about 29.4% during the past five years. However, the company’s most recent quarter decrease of -13.2% looks unattractive. The sales growth rate for a stock is a measure of how the stock’s sales per share (SPS) has grown over a specific period of time. It tells an investor how quickly a company is increasing its revenues. The sales growth rate helps investors determine how strong the overall growth-orientation is for a stock or portfolio.   The best measure of a company is its profitability, for without it, it cannot grow, and if it doesn’t grow, then its stock will trend downward. Increasing profits are the best indication that a company can pay dividends and that the share price will trend upward. Creditors will loan money at a cheaper rate to a profitable company than to an unprofitable one; consequently, profitable companies can use leverage to increase stockholders’ equity even more. Profitability ratios compare different accounts to see how efficiently a business is generating profits. These ratios show how well income is generated through operations, and are important to both creditors and investors. They help determine the company’s ability to continue operating. Currently, Gilead Sciences, Inc. net profit margin for the 12 months is at 42.14%. Comparatively, the peers have a net margin -483.83%, and the sector’s average is 5.28%. In that light, it seems in good position compared to its peers and sector. The profit margin measures the amount of net income earned with each dollar’s worth of revenue. It shows the percentage of sales that remain after all of the company’s expenses have been paid. The higher the ratio, the better.  QEP Resources, Inc. (NYSE:QEP) is another stock that is grabbing investors attention these days. Its shares have trimmed -57.05% since hitting a peak level on Dec. 12, 2016. Thanks to an increase of almost 12.39% in the past one month, the stock price is now with underperforming -50.73% so far on the year — still in weak zone. In this case, shares are 29.2% higher , the worst price in 52 weeks suffered on Aug. 16, 2017, but are collecting gains at -9.39% for the past six months.  The good news is there’s still room for QEP Resources, Inc. (QEP) to grow. At recent closing price of $9.07, QEP has a chance to add $4.73 or 52.15% in 52 weeks, based on mean target price ($13.8) placed by analysts.The analyst consensus opinion of 2 looks like a hold. It has a 36-month beta of 1.71 , so you might be in for a bumpy ride.  For the past 5 years, QEP Resources, Inc.’s EPS growth has been nearly -41.9%. Sure, the percentage is discouraging but better times are ahead as looking out over a next 5-year period, analysts expect the company to see its earnings go up by 18%, annually.  QEP Resources, Inc. (QEP)’s ROE is -0.39%, while industry’s is 6.19%. The average ROE for the sector stands at 15.73%. The return on equity (ROE), also known as return on investment (ROI), is the best measure of the return, since it is the product of the operating performance, asset turnover, and debt-equity management of the firm. If a firm can borrow money and use it to achieve a higher return than the cost of the debt, then the leveraging creates additional revenue that accrues to stockholders as increased equity.  QEP Resources, Inc.’s ROA is -0.2%, while industry’s average is 3.94%. As with any return, the higher this number the better. However, it, too, needs to be taken into the context of a company’s peer group as well as its sector. The average return on assets for companies in the same sector is 9.14. The return on assets (ROA) (aka return on total assets, return on average assets), is one of the most widely used profitability ratios because it is related to both profit margin and asset turnover, and shows the rate of return for both creditors and investors of the company. ROA shows how well a company controls its costs and utilizes its resources.

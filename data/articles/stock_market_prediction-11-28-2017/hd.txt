http://www.criticalhit.net/gaming/retailers-leak-assassins-creed-rogue-hd-re-release/

 If there’s one Assassin’s Creed game that went by underappreciated, it’s Assassin’s creed: Rogue. Sandwiched between the incredible Black Flag and the first exclusively “new gen” outing in the maligned Assassin’s Creed Unity, it didn’t really get the chance to shine. Not only released between the two generations of games, it also fills in the narrative blanks between Assassin’s Creed III and Black Flag, and also between Black Flag and Unity. Here’s what we said, back in 2014: Assassin’s Creed Rogue ties up the America Saga, rounding out what happened between Black Flag and Assassin’s Creed III. The story follows Shay Patrick Cormack as he begins his stabbing journey as an Assassin, working together with the likes of Adewale and Achilles. Shay is a much more cynical character than previous assassins, questioning the value of the brotherhood’s actions and even having personality clashes with some high ranking members. Combining fantastic story telling, intriguing characters and tons to do, Rogue takes Assassin’s Creed to the pinnacle of old generation capabilities. Niggling issues are still present, but the story and characters make the experience seriously worthwhile.  It’s a pity then, that many gave it a miss as they gravitated towards their shiny new Playstation4s and Xbox Ones and played Unity instead. It looks like it’s being given a second chance. Since its release there have been many calls for a new gen release of the game, and it looks like that’s finally happening. A trio of Italian retailers (via Kotaku UK) has apparently leaked the release of an HD remaster of the game coming to PS4 and Xbox One at some point next year. It makes sense, with the renewed interest in the series thanks to the frankly delightful Assassin’s creed Origins, and the success of the rereleased Ezio trilogy. If you missed out on Rogue, it may be worth jumping back in. Last Updated: November 28, 2017 
Editor. I’m old, grumpy and more than just a little cynical. One day, I found myself in possession of a NES, and a copy of Super Mario Bros 3. It was that game that made me realise that games were more than just toys to idly while away time – they were capable of being masterpieces. I’m here now, looking for more of those masterpieces.

I bought it on a steam sale a while back, installed it recently and it is ready to go and be played this holiday. Looking forward to it! It’s a brilliant game. One of my favorites in the series. A brilliant example of taking what works and making it better. Or you can wait for our new blockbuster open world game, ANTHEM Will it have lootboxes and microtransactions? No. It will have opportunities to give you a sense of pride and accomplishment, either through time or investment into your game to make it shorter. Hardest pass of my life. Hardest pass for me was when ate 7 potatoes worth of mash Despite claims that the French media company wanted to close out the deal before the end o…

Shay returns. Assassin’s Creed; Rogue was released on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in 2014 alongside the PS4 and Xbox One release of Unity. The game was set during the Seven Years’ War and sees players step into the boots of an assassin turned Templar who begins to question the beliefs of the assassin’s order. Given that Unity was incredibly buggy upon its launch, Rogue was considered to be the better of the two games and has become quite a favorite among Assassin’s Creed fans for delivering a story that shows the Templar side rather than that of the assassins. Those who never got the chance to play it will be pleased to learn that several Italian retailers have listed an HD release of the game for the PS4 and Xbox One. ePrice, ReluxShop, and Webster are currently listing Assassin’s Creed: Rogue HD with a release date of March 2018.  A PC release of Rogue came out in 2015 so it’s already available to those players. Ubisoft has already re-released the Ezio games on PS4 and Xbox One under the name The Ezio Trilogy, so it seems reasonable that the company would wish to port Rogue. It’s likely this leak is indeed correct as Italian retailers have a history of outing new games before they’re officially released. We’ll see if Ubisoft comments on the situation soon. Assassin’s Creed: Origins, the latest game in the series was released in late October and received strong reviews.

 Italian retailers ePrice, ReluxShop, and Webster are listing an Assassin’s Creed Rogue HD for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One to be released on March 15, 2018.  Assassin’s Creed Rogue was originally released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 day and date with the release of Assassin’s Creed Unity for PlayStation 4, Xbox one, and PC in November 2014. A PC version was released in March 2015. Here’s a brief overview of the game, via PlayStation.com: North America, 18th century. Amid the chaos and violence of the French and Indian War, Shay Patrick Cormac, a fearless young member of the Assassin Brotherhood, undergoes a dark transformation that will forever shape the future of the colonies. After a dangerous mission goes tragically wrong, Shay turns his back on the Assassins who, in response, attempt to end his life. Cast aside by those he once called brothers, Shay sets out on a mission to wipe out all who turned against him and to ultimately become the most feared Assassin hunter in history. Introducing Assassin’s Creed Rogue, the darkest chapter in the Assassin’s Creed franchise yet. As Shay, you will experience the slow transformation from Assassin to Assassin hunter. Follow your own creed and set off on an extraordinary journey through New York City, the wild river valley, and far away to the icy cold waters of the North Atlantic in pursuit of your ultimate goal, to bring down the Assassins.

                                        By VideoGamer.com Staff  •  27 Nov 2017  •  Posted in News In an interesting turn of events, it seems Ubisoft might be gearing up to release a HD version of Assassin's Creed Rogue, if listings spotted on Italian retailers websites are anything to go by. As spotted by Kotaku UK,  there are three separate retailers who all have the game listed as coming for PS4 and Xbox One as a 'HD' release, although none of them can seem to agree on a release date outside of early 2018. Assassin's Creed Rogue is somewhat of an oddity in the series, originally releasing on the older Xbox 360 and PS3 consoles around the time of the first next-gen (now current-gen) only entry in the series Assassin's Creed Unity, with the events taking place between the end of Black Flag and Unity. If true, this would be the first time it's appeared on Xbox One and PlayStation 4. It wouldn't be too surprising as the recent HD release of the The Ezio Trilogy has done pretty well for Ubisoft, and of course there's all the current buzz around the latest game Assassin's Creed Origins starring new best AC protagonist Bayek.

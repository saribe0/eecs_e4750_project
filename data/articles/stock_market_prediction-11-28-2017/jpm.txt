https://simplywall.st/news/2017/11/28/does-jpmorgan-chase-cos-jpm-pe-ratio-warrant-a-buy/

 JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) trades with a trailing P/E of 14x, which is lower than the industry average of 17.8x. While JPM might seem like an attractive stock to buy, it is important to understand the assumptions behind the P/E ratio before you make any investment decisions. Today, I will deconstruct the P/E ratio and highlight what you need to be careful of when using the P/E ratio. View our latest analysis for JPMorgan Chase   A common ratio used for relative valuation is the P/E ratio. It compares a stock’s price per share to the stock’s earnings per share. A more intuitive way of understanding the P/E ratio is to think of it as how much investors are paying for each dollar of the company’s earnings.  Formula Price-Earnings Ratio = Price per share ÷ Earnings per share P/E Calculation for JPM Price per share = $97.93 Earnings per share = $7 ∴ Price-Earnings Ratio = $97.93 ÷ $7 = 14x   Price per share = $97.93 Earnings per share = $7 ∴ Price-Earnings Ratio = $97.93 ÷ $7 = 14x  Price per share = $97.93 Earnings per share = $7 ∴ Price-Earnings Ratio = $97.93 ÷ $7 = 14x  The P/E ratio itself doesn’t tell you a lot; however, it becomes very insightful when you compare it with other similar companies. Ultimately, our goal is to compare the stock’s P/E ratio to the average of companies that have similar attributes to JPM, such as company lifetime and products sold. A common peer group is companies that exist in the same industry, which is what I use below. Since it is expected that similar companies have similar P/E ratios, we can come to some conclusions about the stock if the ratios are different.  Since JPM’s P/E of 14x is lower than its industry peers (17.8x), it means that investors are paying less than they should for each dollar of JPM’s earnings. As such, our analysis shows that JPM represents an under-priced stock.   However, before you rush out to buy JPM, it is important to note that this conclusion is based on two key assumptions. The first is that our peer group actually contains companies that are similar to JPM. If this isn’t the case, the difference in P/E could be due to some other factors. For example, if you are inadvertently comparing lower risk firms with JPM, then JPM’s P/E would naturally be lower than its peers, since investors would value those with lower risk with a higher price. The other possibility is if you were accidentally comparing higher growth firms with JPM. In this case, JPM’s P/E would be lower since investors would also reward its peers’ higher growth with a higher price. The second assumption that must hold true is that the stocks we are comparing JPM to are fairly valued by the market. If this assumption is violated, JPM’s P/E may be lower than its peers because its peers are actually overvalued by investors.   Are you a shareholder? If your personal research into the stock confirms what the P/E ratio is telling you, it might be a good time to add more of JPM to your portfolio. But keep in mind that the usefulness of relative valuation depends on whether you are comfortable with making the assumptions I mentioned above.  Are you a potential investor? If you are considering investing in JPM, basing your decision on the PE metric at one point in time is certainly not sufficient. I recommend you do additional analysis by looking at its intrinsic valuation and using other relative valuation ratios like PEG or EV/EBITDA.  PE is one aspect of your portfolio construction to consider when holding or entering into a stock. But it is certainly not the only factor. Take a look at our most recent infographic report on JPMorgan Chase for a more in-depth analysis of the stock to help you make a well-informed investment decision. Since we know a limitation of PE is it doesn’t properly account for growth, you can use our free platform to see my list of stocks with a high growth potential and see if their PE is still reasonable.

http://www.nasdaq.com/article/jpmorgan-jpm-sanctioned-by-finma-for-money-laundering-cm880015

 Switzerland's financial regulator, FINMA, has sanctioned the Swiss subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM  for money laundering and violating supervision laws.  makeArticleAd();  On Jun 30, 2017, FINMA had ruled JPMorgan for breaking anti-money laundering guidelines and breaching due diligence.    However, FINMA's judgement against JPMorgan, if any, remains undisclosed because the banking giant has been actively trying to prevent the publication of the regulator's decision.      The matter came to light when recently the Federal Administrative Court published its ruling against JPMorgan, which it had issued on Nov 8, 2017.    The court document mentions facts about the initial ruling where JPMorgan's subsidiary was considered guilty of money laundering. However, exact details of the wrongdoing are still shrouded in mystery.    Though, FINMA does not have the authorization to levy fines, it is allowed to confiscate a banking institution's gains that it has realised unlawfully or enforce professional limitations on such institutions.    JPMorgan has not commented on the ruling yet. Nevertheless, a spokeswomen of the company said in a statement, "There is nothing more important to us than the safety and soundness of the global monetary system."    Although JPMorgan has resolved quite a few litigation issues, it still faces investigations from several federal agencies and a few foreign governments for its business conducts in the pre-crisis period. As a result, the company's legal expenses are expected to remain elevated, which might marginally affect its bottom line growth in the near future.

Looking further out we can see that the stock has moved 13.49% over the year to date. Along with these its last twelve month performance is stands at 24.23% while moved 16.72% for the past six months according to Finviz reported data. Analytical Significance of Simple Moving Average The SMA200 of the stock is at 7.35%, SMA20 is -1.32%, while SMA50 is 0.29%. JPM’s relative volume was 1.13. Relative volume is a great indicator to keep a close eye on, but like most indicators it works best in conjunction with other indicators and on different time frames. Higher relative volume you will have more liquidity in the stock which will tighten spreads and allow you to trade with more size without a ton of slippage. JPM’s overall volume in the last trading session was 13,079,063 shares. Important Technical Indicators to keep in Focus:- A statistical measure of the dispersion of returns (volatility) for JPM producing salvation in Investors mouth, it has week volatility of 0.98% and for the month booked as 1.22%. Regardless of which metric you utilize, a firm understanding of the concept of volatility and how it is measured is essential to successful investing. A stock that maintains a relatively stable price has low volatility. When investing in a volatile security, the risk of success is increased just as much as the risk of failure.  JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s beta is 1.21 whilst the stock has an average true range (ATR) of 1.21. Other technical indicators are worth considering in assessing the prospects for EQT. RSI for instance is currently at 46.15. It is common practice for investors to use the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio or price multiple) to determine if a company’s stock price is over or undervalued. Companies with a high P/E ratio are typically growth stocks. However, their relatively high multiples do not necessarily mean their stocks are overpriced and not good buys for the long term. The PEG ratio shows us that, when compare to the beer company, the always-popular tech company doesn’t have the growth rate to justify its higher P/E, and its stock price appears overvalued. JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s currently has a PEG ratio of 1.59 where as its P/E ratio is 14.04. The company P/S (price to Sales) ratio is 5.51, P/B (price to Book) ratio is 1.49, while its P/C (price to Cash) ratio stands at 0.29. Should You Go With High Insider Ownership? Many value investors look for stocks with a high percent of insider ownership, under the theory that when management are shareholders, they will act in its own self interest, and create shareholder value in the long-term. This aligns the interests of shareholders with management, thus benefiting everyone. While this sounds great in theory, high insider ownership can actually lead to the opposite result, a management team that is unaccountable because they can keep their jobs under almost any circumstance. Currently JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM)’s shares owned by insiders are 0.10%, whereas shares owned by institutional owners are 75.90%. November 28, 2017 November 28, 2017 November 28, 2017

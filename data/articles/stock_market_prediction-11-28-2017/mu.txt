 On-Screen Marking System (OSM) service provider MeritTrac Services, under fire for the fiasco at Mumbai University in which results were delayed, blamed the shortage of MU evaluators, lack of co-ordination between stakeholders and MU’s own processing programme for tabulating results after evaluation. Responding to a questionnaire sent by The Hindu, the Bangalore-based service provider, which claims to be the country’s largest private testing and assessment company, said its role in MU was restricted to digitising answer scripts, making them available on the server, enabling evaluation through authorised computers and sharing scores with the university after evaluation. This, it says, is roughly 25% of the work involved in the evaluation process. Nagendran Sundarajan, executive vice-president, MeritTrac, said, “Under ideal conditions, the evaluation process should have lagged the availability of answer scripts in the server by just one week to 10 days. Unfortunately, teachers’ availability hampered the progress of evaluation process. Evaluation for some of the last few programmes were extended by the university till September 2017.”  Mr. Sundarajan added that some of the most critical activities, including tabulation of results, incorporating internal assessment marks, assigning overall weightage were not part of MeritTrac’s scope of work. “This is where most of the delays occurred. The university, through its own result-processing programme, checks for attendance and other rules involved before sending it to its website and processing unit for printing mark sheets.”  ‘We’re totally capable’ Refuting allegations that it was unable to handle a large-scale operation like the one at MU, MeritTrac said its platform is capable of handling up to one lakh evaluations per day, which is beyond MU’s requirement.  It also denied allegations that it was unable to handle supplements taken by students beyond 40 pages in the main answer sheets. A company representative said, “We have no issues in digitising even 1,000 pages, but the supplements will have to be logically tagged to the main answer script through appropriate or unique bar codes, or through a back-end system of unique seat numbers by the university. The scope of printing the blank answer scripts, allocating bar codes series, seat numbers are under the university.”  It also brushed aside allegations that 3,000 answer sheets went missing during the first semester exams in this academic year due to its negligence. “At all points of time, the answer scripts were kept only within the university premises. So, there was no question of MeritTrac losing the answer scripts. MeritTrac team was only given access in to the university premises to do the scanning activity. These premises were always under the supervision of the university security personnel.”  Dr Ashok Yende, director, Mumbai Law Academy at MU, said, “Yes, there was some non-cooperation by evaluators this year due to then-VC Sanjay Deshmukh’s decision to introduce OSM just before the exams. It’s also a fact that evaluators sat through slow downloads, had wrong answer sheets opening on screens and other technical problems. Yes, there is a shortage of evaluators for courses like Law, since most are part-timers. This issue had always been there, and manually evaluated results were faster despite such issues.”  A company official added, “MeritTrac is just one element in the larger ecosystem. The university has to bring entities together, drive the process and manage their internal moving parts. Ensuring speed and timelines of evaluation would ensure faster turnaround time.”

http://www.nasdaq.com/article/why-micron-mu-can-be-an-attractive-investment-right-now-cm882460

  Micron Technology Inc. MU  is firing on all cylinders driven by a surge in DRAM and NAND chip prices. This is primarily due to imbalances between industry demand and supply, which are leading to periodic shortage and temporary price hike.  makeArticleAd();  Micron is benefiting from robust demand for its high-performance chips in rapidly growing markets like Cloud Computing, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Augmented Reality (AR) and varied application of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology.    The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in fiscal 2018 and 2019 earnings has increased significantly over the last 30 days, primarily driven by improving fundamentals and strong growth prospects.    The stock hit a 52 week high of $49.89 on Nov 22. Moreover, Micron shares have returned 126.6% year to date, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's gain of 16.6%.     DRAM Demand Remains Strong    We note that DRAM accounted for 66% of fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 revenues. Cloud sales jumped roughly 50% year over year driven by increasing DRAM content per server.    DRAMeXchange projects that demand for DRAM will jump 20.6% in 2018 from an estimated increase of 19.6% in 2017. The primary driver is expected to be higher storage demand from smartphones and servers.    Smartphones have witnessed an increase of 33.4% in DRAM content this year, to an average of 3.2 GB per device. As smartphone original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) plan to launch devices with higher capacity and more demanding applications like AR and AI, demand for DRAM is expected to grow much faster.    Moreover, server DRAM demand is expected to remain strong as Cloud Data Center customers seek innovative solutions to reduce their workload. The high-density modules based on advanced manufacturing nodes have come to the market, urging server OEMs to overhaul and shift to new technology for better results. This also provides significant growth opportunity for Micron.   Expanding Footprint in SSD Market    Micron has been expanding into the solid-state drive (SSD) storage market that has helped it to offset sluggishness in the PC market. SSDs take less space, which means it is more suitable for mobile, thinner laptops and tablets. In the fourth quarter, storage revenues soared 71%, primarily driven by strong demand for SSD products.    In this regard, Micron's partnership with Seagate Technologies STX  has given a significant boost to its high-value enterprise SSD portfolio. Management projects healthy demand for SSDs, with demand for higher-density SSDs expected to improve in the long haul.    Per TechNavio, the enterprise SSD market is projected to witness a CAGR of 17% over 2016-2020. The strong projection bodes well for Micron.   Zacks Rank & Other Picks    Micron currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Intel Corporation INTC  and NVIDIA Corporation NVDA  are two other stocks worth considering in the broader technology sector. Both carry the same Zacks Rank as that of Micron. You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks   here   .    Long-term earnings growth for Intel and NVIDIA is currently pegged at 8.4% and 11.2%, respectively.   Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?    Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.    With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.    It's not the one you think.

Smartphones have witnessed an increase of 33.4% in DRAM content this year, to an average of 3.2 GB per device. As smartphone original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) plan to launch devices with higher capacity and more demanding applications like AR and AI, demand for DRAM is expected to grow much faster.    Moreover, server DRAM demand is expected to remain strong as Cloud Data Center customers seek innovative solutions to reduce their workload. The high-density modules based on advanced manufacturing nodes have come to the market, urging server OEMs to overhaul and shift to new technology for better results. This also provides significant growth opportunity for Micron.   Expanding Footprint in SSD Market    Micron has been expanding into the solid-state drive (SSD) storage market that has helped it to offset sluggishness in the PC market. SSDs take less space, which means it is more suitable for mobile, thinner laptops and tablets. In the fourth quarter, storage revenues soared 71%, primarily driven by strong demand for SSD products.    In this regard, Micron's partnership with Seagate Technologies STX  has given a significant boost to its high-value enterprise SSD portfolio. Management projects healthy demand for SSDs, with demand for higher-density SSDs expected to improve in the long haul.    Per TechNavio, the enterprise SSD market is projected to witness a CAGR of 17% over 2016-2020. The strong projection bodes well for Micron.   Zacks Rank & Other Picks    Micron currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Intel Corporation INTC  and NVIDIA Corporation NVDA  are two other stocks worth considering in the broader technology sector. Both carry the same Zacks Rank as that of Micron. You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks   here   .    Long-term earnings growth for Intel and NVIDIA is currently pegged at 8.4% and 11.2%, respectively.   Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?    Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.    With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.    It's not the one you think.

U.S. stock futures are trending higher this morning, despite an impending flurry of data set to sweep over the Street. Foremost, Jerome Powell, President Donald Trump’s pick to run the Federal Reserve, is slated to testify before a Senate confirmation panel this morning. Traders will be looking for cues on how Powell will run the central bank. Also from the Fed, a trio of regional presidents are slated to give speeches later today. On the economic front, October advance trade goods data, September home prices and the November consumer confidence index are all slated to hit near the open. Against this crowded backdrop, Dow Jones Industrial Average futures have risen 0.14%, S&P 500 futures have added 0.09% and Nasdaq-100 futures are up 0.09%. On the options front, volume remained relatively light as traders filtered back in from the holiday weekend. Overall, about 16.6 million calls and 12.1 million puts changed hands on Monday. As for the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio ticked lower to 0.61, while the 10-day moving average held at 0.63. Diving into Monday’s options activity, Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) was smacked lower amid heavy volume after Morgan Stanley warned of falling NAND chip prices. Elsewhere, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has seen a surge in both call options activity and short interest in recent weeks, while Square Inc (NASDAQ:SQ) was downgraded to “sell” at BTIG due to bitcoin speculation.  Morgan Stanley downgraded several semiconductor makers yesterday after stating that “now is the time to reduce exposure to NAND (flash memory) and Asian semiconductor names.” The brokerage firm says that they see the pricing power that bolstered NAND producers is reversing soon. While Morgan said that Micron would be fine due to its exposure to DRAM, the damage was already done. MU stock shed more than 3% yesterday, pulling back to its 10-day moving average. This technical support provided courage to MU options traders, as the stock was flooded with calls on Monday. Volume nearly doubled MU’s daily average and topped 281,000 contracts. Calls made up an impressive 72% of this activity. Expectations were already set pretty high for December, however, as the front-month put/call open interest ratio has fallen to a reading of 0.37, with calls nearly tripling puts for the series. That said, peak December call OI still rests at the in-the-money $45 strike, hinting that, despite the enthusiasm, MU options traders are still somewhat tempered in their expectations.

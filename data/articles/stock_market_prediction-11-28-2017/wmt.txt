Consistently, one of the more popular stocks people enter into their stock options watchlist  at Stock Options Channel is Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (Symbol: WMT). So this week we highlight one interesting put contract, and one interesting call contract, from the January 2019 expiration for WMT. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting, is at the $82.50 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $3.15. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 3.8% return against the $82.50 commitment, or a 3.3% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost  ).      Selling a put does not give an investor access to WMT's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. So unless Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. sees its shares decline 14.8% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $79.35 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $3.15 from $82.50), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 3.3% annualized rate of return.  makeArticleAd();  Worth considering, is that the annualized 3.3% figure actually exceeds the 2.1% annualized dividend paid by Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. by 1.2%, based on the current share price of $96.66. And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to fall 14.85% to reach the $82.50 strike price.    Always important when discussing dividends is the fact that, in general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., looking at the dividend history chart for WMT below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 2.1% annualized dividend yield.    Turning to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the January 2019 expiration, for shareholders of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (Symbol: WMT) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 2.1% annualized dividend yield. Selling the covered call at the $110 strike and collecting the premium based on the $3.30 bid, annualizes to an additional 3% rate of return against the current stock price (this is what we at Stock Options Channel refer to as the YieldBoost  ), for a total of 5.1% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $110 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but WMT shares would have to advance 13.5% from current levels for that to occur, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 16.9% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.    The chart below shows the trailing twelve month trading history for Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., highlighting in green where the $82.50 strike is located relative to that history, and highlighting the $110 strike in red:       The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2019 put or call options highlighted in this article deliver a rate of return that represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (considering the last 252 trading day WMT historical stock prices  using closing values, as well as today's price of $96.66) to be 18%.    In mid-afternoon trading on Monday, the put volume among S&P 500 components was 854,085 contracts, with call volume at 1.49M, for a put:call ratio of 0.57 so far for the day. Compared to the long-term median put:call ratio of .65, that represents high call volume relative to puts; in other words, buyers are showing a preference for calls in  options trading  so far today.

WMT – Walmart erased the gap with Amazon in the online retail pricing wars. Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT) has been locked in an online pricing battle with Amazon (AMZN) for the past few years. The retail juggernaut has been aggressively slashing prices on a number of items online, and as Reuters reports, that gap appears to have all but vanished: Prices at Walmart.com are now only 0.3 percent more expensive than Amazon on average, according to the study by retail data analytics firm Market Track, which analyzed prices of 213 products in 11 categories over a period of 700 days ending November 7, 2017. By comparison, Wal-Mart’s online prices were 3 percent higher than Amazon’s on average in the first 350 days ending November 7, 2016, according to the study. In certain areas, like wearables, which include items like Apple Watches and Fitbit fitness trackers, Walmart actually has a sizable advantage. Market Track’s data shows WMT’s wearables prices were 6.4% lower than Amazon’s this year, in sharp contrast to last year, when Walmart’s prices were 12.6% higher. In the sports and outdoor products categories, Walmart is 1.3% lower, versus 3.5% higher in 2016. Consistently low pricing is a big part of Walmart’s new online strategy, and it appears to be working. The idea is to lure online shoppers away from Amazon — if it that means taking a significant profit hit — in order to win market share and hopefully get consumers to spend on other items when they order as well. Wal-Mart Stores Inc shares were unchanged in premarket trading Tuesday. Year-to-date, WMT has gained 42.65%, versus a 18.08% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period. WMT currently has a StockNews.com POWR Rating of A (Strong Buy), and is ranked #1 of 18 stocks in the Grocery/Big Box Retailers category.

Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) is an interesting player in the Services space, with a focus on Discount, Variety Stores. The stock has been active on the tape, currently trading at $96.62, up from yesterday’s close by 0.22%. Given the stock’s recent action, it seemed like a good time to take a closer look at the company’s recent data. Fundamental Analysis This company has been competing with others in the Services space and offers its own combination of interesting factors Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) currently trades with a market capitalization of $288.00 Billion. That value represents a market adjusting for revenues that have been growing by 4.23 % on a quarterly year/year basis as of the company’s last quarterly report. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For WMT, the company currently has $7.03 Billion of cash on the books, which is offset by $9.02 Billion current liabilities. You can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $18.89 Billion over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to fall in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $1.35 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 32.56% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors. Technical Analysis No analysis is ever complete without a thorough survey of a stock’s technical behavior. Looking at the stock’s movement on the chart, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. recorded a 52-week high of $100.13. It is now trading 3.51% off that level. The stock is trading $86.26 its 50-day moving average by -10.36%. The stock carved out a 52-week low down at $65.28. In recent action, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) has made a move of +9.03% over the past month, which has come on weak relative transaction volume. Over the trailing year, the stock is underperforming the S&P 500 by 17.96, and it’s gotten there by action that has been less volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. In terms of the mechanics underlying that movement, traders will want to note that the stock is trading on a float of 3.12% with $1.41 Billion sitting short, betting on future declines. That suggests something of the likelihood of a short squeeze in shares of WMT.

Price Target A price target is the projected price level of a financial security stated by an investment analyst.

This is the price at which the trader or investor wants to exit his existing position so he can realize the most reward. Basically, a price target is an individual analyst’s projection on the future price of a stock. There is no concrete way to calculate a price target. Different analysts and financial institutions use various valuation methods and consider different economic forces when deciding on a price target. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) has been given an average price target of $94.01 from analysts, according to data collected by Finviz. Earnings Forecast Earnings per share (EPS) is the portion of a company’s profit allocated to each outstanding share of common stock. Earnings per share serves as an indicator of a company’s profitability. Consensus earnings estimates are far from perfect, but they are watched by many investors and play an important role in measuring the appropriate valuation for a stock. Investors measure stock performance on the basis of a company’s earnings power. To make a proper assessment, investors seek a sound estimate of this year’s and next year’s earnings per share (EPS), as well as a strong sense of how much the company will earn even farther down the road. Maximum and minimum EPS estimate for the current quarter is projected at $1.36 and $1.23, respectively, according to 31 analysts. Comparatively, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. posted earnings of $0 per share in the same quarter last year. The company is expected to report earnings of $1.34 a share for the next quarter.

It is the “top line” or “gross income” figure from which costs are subtracted to determine net income. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) is expected to post revenue of $131.22 Billion in the current quarter, according to consensus of 23 analysts. The high and low revenue estimates for the current quarter are $133.53 Billion and $130.07 Billion, respectively. The company reported revenue of $0 in the same period last year. Moving Averages A moving average (MA) is a trend-following or lagging indicator because it is based on past prices. The average is taken over a specific period of time, like 10 days, 20 minutes, 30 weeks, or any time period the trader chooses. There are advantages to using a moving average in your trading, as well options on what type of moving average to use. Moving average strategies are also popular and can be tailored to any time frame, suiting both long term investors and short-term traders. A moving average can help cut down the amount of “noise” on a price chart. Look at the direction of the moving average to get a basic idea of which way the price is moving. Angled up and price is moving up (or was recently) overall, angled down and price is moving down overall, moving sideways and the price is likely in a range. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)’s distance from 200 day simple moving average is 23.68 percent, its distance from 50 day simple moving average is 12.45 percent, while its distance from 20 day simple moving average is 5.83 percent.

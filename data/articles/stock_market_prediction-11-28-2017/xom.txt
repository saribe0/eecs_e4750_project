Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) is an interesting player in the Basic Materials space, with a focus on Major Integrated Oil & Gas. The stock has been active on the tape, currently trading at $81.42, up from yesterday’s close by 0.39%. Given the stock’s recent action, it seemed like a good time to take a closer look at the company’s recent data. Fundamental Analysis Money managers are always interested in a company that can find the right recipe of fundamental data because it reflects something important going on underneath the surface. Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) currently trades with a market capitalization of $347.74 Billion. That value represents a market adjusting for revenues that have been growing by 13.47 % on a quarterly year/year basis as of the company’s last quarterly report.

 The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For XOM, the company currently has $4.27 Billion of cash on the books, which is offset by $15.74 Billion current liabilities. You can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $15.26 Billion over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to grow in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $0.96 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 51.78% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors. Technical Analysis Sometimes, we can understand most about a stock by simply looking at how it has been trading. Looking at the stock’s movement on the chart, Exxon Mobil Corporation recorded a 52-week high of $93.21. It is now trading 11.79% off that level. The stock is trading $82.13 its 50-day moving average by 0.70999999999999%. The stock carved out a 52-week low down at $76.05. In recent action, Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) has made a move of -2.46% over the past month, which has come on Strong relative transaction volume. Over the trailing year, the stock is underperforming the S&P 500 by 17.96, and it’s gotten there by action that has been less volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. In terms of the mechanics underlying that movement, traders will want to note that the stock is trading on a float of 0.78% with $4.23 Billion sitting short, betting on future declines. That suggests something of the likelihood of a short squeeze in shares of XOM.

Consistently, one of the more popular stocks people enter into their stock options watchlist  at Stock Options Channel is Exxon Mobil Corp (Symbol: XOM). So this week we highlight one interesting put contract, and one interesting call contract, from the January 2019 expiration for XOM. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting, is at the $67.50 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $1.71. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 2.5% return against the $67.50 commitment, or a 2.2% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost  ).      Selling a put does not give an investor access to XOM's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. So unless Exxon Mobil Corp sees its shares fall 16.8% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $65.79 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $1.71 from $67.50), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 2.2% annualized rate of return. Turning to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the January 2019 expiration, for shareholders of Exxon Mobil Corp (Symbol: XOM) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 3.8% annualized dividend yield. Selling the covered call at the $87.50 strike and collecting the premium based on the $2.42 bid, annualizes to an additional 2.6% rate of return against the current stock price (this is what we at Stock Options Channel refer to as the YieldBoost  ), for a total of 6.4% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $87.50 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but XOM shares would have to advance 7.9% from current levels for that to happen, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 10.9% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.makeArticleAd();    The chart below shows the trailing twelve month trading history for Exxon Mobil Corp, highlighting in green where the $67.50 strike is located relative to that history, and highlighting the $87.50 strike in red:       The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2019 put or call options highlighted in this article deliver a rate of return that represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Exxon Mobil Corp (considering the last 252 trading day XOM historical stock prices  using closing values, as well as today's price of $81.08) to be 12%.    In mid-afternoon trading on Monday, the put volume among S&P 500 components was 854,085 contracts, with call volume at 1.49M, for a put:call ratio of 0.57 so far for the day. Compared to the long-term median put:call ratio of .65, that represents high call volume relative to puts; in other words, buyers are showing a preference for calls in  options trading  so far today.

Consistently, one of the more popular stocks people enter into their stock options watchlist  at Stock Options Channel is McDonald's Corp (Symbol: MCD). So this week we highlight one interesting put contract, and one interesting call contract, from the January 2019 expiration for MCD. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting, is at the $115 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $1.30. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 1.1% return against the $115 commitment, or a 1% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost  ).      Selling a put does not give an investor access to MCD's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. So unless McDonald's Corp sees its shares fall 31.6% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $113.70 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $1.30 from $115), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 1% annualized rate of return. Turning to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the January 2019 expiration, for shareholders of McDonald's Corp (Symbol: MCD) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 2.4% annualized dividend yield. Selling the covered call at the $190 strike and collecting the premium based on the $3.80 bid, annualizes to an additional 2% rate of return against the current stock price (this is what we at Stock Options Channel refer to as the YieldBoost  ), for a total of 4.4% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $190 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but MCD shares would have to advance 12.9% from current levels for that to happen, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 15.2% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.makeArticleAd();    The chart below shows the trailing twelve month trading history for McDonald's Corp, highlighting in green where the $115 strike is located relative to that history, and highlighting the $190 strike in red:       The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2019 put or call options highlighted in this article deliver a rate of return that represents good reward for the risks.

Top Energy Stocks: XOM: -0.1% CVX: +0.01% COP: flat SLB: -0.8% OXY: flat Energy shares were mixed ahead of Tuesday's opening bell, with crude oil futures lower, as traders turned toward Vienna, where petroleum ministers from OPEC nations and major-producer Russia will meet Thursday. OPEC is expected to extend the current cartel-designed production cuts beyond the slated expiration of March 2018. However, there are some pundits who posit Russia, the biggest non-OPEC producer in the agreement, could pull out of an extension, softening markets. Yet Russian oil companies are chafing under the production ceiling, and Saudi Arabia and Russia are not on the same page when it comes to Saudi tensions with Iran. Light, sweet crude oil for January delivery was down 0.7% at $57.68 per barrel. In other energy futures, heating oil was down 0.01% at $1.95 per gallon while natural gas was down 1.9% at $3.08 per 1 million British thermal units. In energy ETFs, the United States Oil Fund ( USO  ) was down 0.6% at $11.52 while the United States Natural Gas ETF ( UNG  ) was up 1.3% at $6.11. In energy sector news, Carrizo Oil & Gas ( CRZO  ) said it plans to redeem about 25%, or $150 million, of its 7.50% senior notes due 2020, on Dec. 28. The oil-and-gas driller, active in the Eagle Ford and Permian Basin fields of the US, said the notes will be redeemed at 101.875% of the principal amount, plus accrued interest. Carrizo OIl & Gas said the funds for the redemption are primarily proceeds from its previously announced divestiture program, including the sale of properties in the Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale. The company said the redemption is consistent with its plan to reduce leverage, and it plans to continue leverage reduction in 2018.

By Ernest Scheyder and Erwin Seba HOUSTON, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp  Chief Executive Darren Woods is reorganizing the company's refining operations, part of a push to boost profits amid volatile oil and natural gas prices, the company said on Monday. The changes at the world's largest publicly traded oil producer are the most sweeping to date by Woods, who became chief executive in January after former chief Rex Tillerson resigned to become U.S. secretary of state. Exxon spokeswoman Charlotte Huffaker confirmed the downstream business overhaul in a statement, adding the company expects it will "improve decision making and enhance performance in the market."    The parts of the business impacted were refining and marketing divisions, said spokesman Scott Silvestri.  Company sources told Reuters Exxon's chemical operation also has been restructured, but Silvestri denied this.  It was not immediately clear if the changes will involve job cuts or executive departures. Exxon's Huffaker said she could not say if there would be any impact on jobs.  The reorganization aims to squeeze more profits from the downstream business as the company works to improve its exploration and production operations, which have struggled since 2014 to adjust to lower oil,  and gas prices. The downstream restructuring, disclosed internally last month, will combine the fuels and lubricants division with the supply and refining divisions. Financial responsibility for the merged operation will rest with country and regional chiefs who report to Exxon's Irving, Texas, headquarters rather than divisional bosses as previously, according to people familiar with the matter. The changes are designed to simplify operations and increase accountability for profitability, the sources said. 
 REFINING STRENGTH Exxon's refining and chemical operations have grown in stature under Woods, delivering steady earnings compared with its oil and gas production. Exxon operates 22 refineries in 14 countries, processing nearly 5 million barrels of oil per day. The firm builds chemical and refining plants in the same location, allowing managers to shift production between fuels or chemicals based on demand. The changes come as Exxon expands the refining division. The company is investing $20 billion through 2022 to expand its chemical and oil refining plants on the U.S. Gulf Coast. The refining and chemicals arms contributed more than $4.2 billion apiece to 2016 earnings, compared with a $196 million profit from exploration and production. Last year's results were affected by sharply lower crude prices. In some quarters, Exxon would not have made any money were it not for its refineries. This year, the company's oil and gas business bounced back to a $5 billion profit during the first nine months on stronger crude prices. Refining earnings were $4.03 billion and chemicals $3.25 billion, respectively, for the first three quarters this year.  Some staff members have raised questions as to whether there is any need to alter a system seen as largely successful, said the sources who declined to be identified. It was unclear if the changes would impact an internal accounting practice known as general interest principle. That rule permits certain transactions to be loss-making for a local division if they are beneficial for the corporation as a whole. Exxon did not comment on any potential accounting changes.

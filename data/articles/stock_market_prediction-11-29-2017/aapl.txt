 HPQ GRPN AAPL ATVI  Per Steven Milunovich, an analyst with UBS, Apple Inc’s (AAPL  -  Free Report)	 iPhone unit sales in 2018 could be lower than expected, given the “flat” buying intent in many countries, reports Investor’s Business Daily. However, revenues are likely to be cushioned by higher average selling price of premium iPhone models (iPhone X). Subsequently, he slashed his iPhone unit sales growth estimate to 10% from 12% projected earlier. However, he has retained the “Buy” rating on the stock. Investor’s Business Daily quoted the analyst saying, “Phone buying intent vs. a year ago for the next 12 months is flat in the U.S. and Japan and down in the U.K., China and Germany. If the survey is correct regarding more muted near-term unit growth, the Apple narrative could shift toward monetizing the large iPhone base." Apple Inc. Revenue (TTM)   Apple Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Apple Inc. Quote There has been tremendous excitement surrounding iPhone X. It is widely considered to be a super cycle. The sale of this edition is expected to be boosted xby features like a glass body, a dual curved edge-to-edge OLED (organic light-emitting diode) display with wireless charging (USB-C), higher storage options and a far superior camera. There are also speculations that robust iPhone X sales will make Apple the first company to touch the $1 trillion valuation mark. Currently, Apple’s market cap is nearly $894 billion. Its shares have increased about 50.3% year over year and hit a 52-week high of $176.24. Shares are currently trading at $174.09. Per a recent report by GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives, as quoted by Investor’s Business Daily, iPhone X cycle could help Apple reach the milestone figure as early as next year. Apart from iPhone X, the analyst adds that the fast booming Services business and the rebound witnessed in China could propel Apple to new highs. A cash pile of $250 billion could help Apple make strategic acquisitions (Netflix, Walt Disney,Tesla and the rumors go on) and carry on with its gigantic shareholder return plan.  iPhone continues to be the mainstay of Apple’s revenues. The revolutionary iPhone, released in June 2007, changed the world forever and catapulted Apple to new highs. The success of iPhone over the last decade is well chronicled. Reportedly, Apple has sold over 1.2 billion iPhones across the globe, earning over $760 billion in revenues. Since the first iPhone release, Apple shares have skyrocketed compared with the industry to which it belongs. Over the last decade, Apple stock has returned 898.6% while the industry witnessed a rally of 424.9%. At present, Apple carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

It’s a well-documented fact that the AAPL stock multiple rises and falls with each iPhone cycle, depending on whether it was weak, strong, or one of those so-called “supercycles” we’ve been hearing so much about this year. Leading up to the iPhone X release, Wall Street was whipped into a frenzy as analysts raved about the “supercycle” that would ensue, but now, the dust is starting to clear. Analysts are trying to get a sense of where AAPL stock will go next, and not all of the projections are good, despite the fact that the all-hallowed iPhone X is now in the hands of some consumers. There’s little doubt that AAPL stock is in for a bumpy ride, but just how rough might things get? Nomura Instinet analyst Jeffrey Kvaal warns that the AAPL stock multiple might contract so much that the shares could plummet to $130 per share. The stock currently trades above $170 per share, and it hasn’t touched $130 since early this year. However, many people may have missed this forecast because it wasn’t mentioned in the first couple of pages. Talk about burying the lede. Kvaal remains as bullish on AAPL stock as ever, despite his warning that the multiple could contract significantly after the iPhone X cycle. He noted that the AAPL stock multiple has run in cycles since 2010, expanding ahead of a major redesign, such as the iPhone 6 in 2014 and the iPhone X and iPhone 8 this year. After expanding before the redesign, the multiple typically contracts the following year. According to Kvaal, the AAPL stock multiple contracted after the iPhone 6 cycle in the 6s cycle the following year due to “lower off-cycle demand and upgrades.” He added that currently, the multiple is around 14.5 times, but over its cycles of expansion and contraction, it has averaged 12.4 times since 2010, with the bottom end of the range at 8 times and the top end at 15 times. In other words, the AAPL stock multiple is currently near its historic top, which can’t bode well for the shares in the near term. The Nomura Instinet analyst believes that the expansion of the AAPL stock multiple is “likely in the later innings,” meaning that the shares could be about to fall off a cliff. Kvaal warned that the contraction in the AAPL stock multiple “could be meaningful,” as the P/E has averaged 9 times after a supercycle. He also added that every point the multiple contracts is equivalent to about $12 or 7% downside in AAPL stock. In this case, he pegs downside in the stock at $130 after the iPhone 8/X cycle, which would be a P/E multiple of 10 times his calendar 2019 earnings per share estimate. Of course, the multiple is only one part of a stock price, with earnings being the other key part of P/E multiples, in this case. Kvaal sees earnings per share upside in the December quarter and into fiscal 2018 and later. He also notes that tax reform and/ or cash repatriation will have an impact, if either event ever happens. His price target on AAPL stock is $185, which is a multiple of 13.1 times his upside estimate for Apple’s fiscal 2019 earnings per share but 15.4 times the consensus earnings estimate for fiscal 2019. Applying the current multiple of 14.5 times to his upside earnings per share estimate would put AAPL stock at $205 per share. For those who see Apple strictly as a long-term investment and not a trading stock, a plunge to $130 might not seem like a big deal because they’re assuming that the shares will recover. However, buying any stock is a gamble, even one like Apple. On the other hand, should the shares fall as low as Kvaal is predicting or even lower, you can bet that there will be plenty of takers just waiting to scoop up more stock on the pullback. Of course, things could look very different a year from now. It all depends on what Apple does next, whether it’s able to monetize its user base more fully, if it enters a new product category, etc. AAPL stock slipped in intraday trading on Tuesday, falling by as much as 0.7% to $172.88.

        A Rosenblatt analyst estimates that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) sold 6M iPhone X units during Black Friday, according to StreetInsider.                Analyst Jun Zhang believes the production rate for the iPhone X increased to 3M units per week and could reach 4M per week next month.                 The firm raises its December quarter iPhone X shipment estimates from between 27M and 28M units to 30M units.                 Zhang expects seasonality to follow the inventory build, which would cause softness in March. Estimates for the March quarter drop from 45M to 40M, but 3M of that difference moved to December.                 Firm reiterates Buy rating and $180 price target.  Apple shares are down 1.1%.   Previously: Apple SVP Srouji sells over $1.8M of shares (Nov. 28) Now read: Apple: Smart iPhone Decision »

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) has long thrived on supercycles — periods of heightened unit sales as consumers upgrade to next-generation products. But some research suggests a dampening of the iPhone cycle as Apple customers retain older models, ultimately forcing review of Apple’s earnings strategy. UBS analyst Steven Milunovich reiterated a Buy rating on Apple with a $190 price target. Despite anticipated deceleration in the U.S. and Europe, iPhone sales should pick up in China and emerging markets in 2018, yielding “not a ‘supercycle’ but a solid year,” Milunovich said. (See Milunovich's track record here.)  UBS forecasts an ever-muted cycle, with Apple's 2018 upside driven primarily by higher average selling price compounded by 10-percent growth, rather than the previously expected 12-percent figure.  “The stock narrative should shift from iPhone cycles to iPhone annuity — how does Apple monetize the installed base through additional products and services?” the analyst said.  At the time of publication, shares were trading marginally lower off the open at $174.64.

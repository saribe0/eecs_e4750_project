The stock has been active on the tape, currently trading at $57.91, up from yesterday’s close by 0.40%. Given the stock’s recent action, it seemed like a good time to take a closer look at the company’s recent data. Fundamental Analysis Does this stock stack up well when compared to its peers in the industry space? Let’s take a look. Applied Materials, Inc.

 The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For AMAT, the company currently has $5.01 Billion of cash on the books. You can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $3.27 Billion over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to grow in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $0.98 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 82.33% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors. Technical Analysis It’s important to check the technicals to get a sense of how AMAT has been acting. Looking at the stock’s movement on the chart, Applied Materials, Inc. recorded a 52-week high of $60.89. It is now trading 2.98% off that level. The stock is trading $53.80 its 50-day moving average by -4.11%. The stock carved out a 52-week low down at $29.85. In recent action, Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT) has made a move of +3.54% over the past month, which has come on weak relative transaction volume. Over the trailing year, the stock is underperforming the S&P 500 by 17.96, and it’s gotten there by action that has been more volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. In terms of the mechanics underlying that movement, traders will want to note that the stock is trading on a float of 1.01% with $1.06 Billion sitting short, betting on future declines. That suggests something of the likelihood of a short squeeze in shares of AMAT.

Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) shares are up more than 79.45% this year and recently increased 0.40% or $0.23 to settle at $57.91. Oclaro, Inc. (NASDAQ:OCLR), on the other hand, is down -21.28% year to date as of 11/24/2017. It currently trades at $7.05 and has returned 10.77% during the past week. Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) and Oclaro, Inc. (NASDAQ:OCLR) are the two most active stocks in the Semiconductor Equipment & Materials industry based on today’s trading volumes. Investors are clearly interested in the two names, but is one a better choice than the other? We will compare the two companies across growth, profitability, risk, valuation, and insider trends to answer this question. Growth One of the key things investors look for in a company is the ability to grow earnings at a high compound rate over time. Analysts expect AMAT to grow earnings at a 16.82% annual rate over the next 5 years. Comparatively, OCLR is expected to grow at a 14.00% annual rate. All else equal, AMAT’s higher growth rate would imply a greater potential for capital appreciation. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Profitability and Returns Growth doesn’t mean much if it comes at the cost of weak profitability. To adjust for differences in capital structure we’ll use EBITDA margin and Return on Investment (ROI) as measures of profitability and return. , compared to an EBITDA margin of 25.14% for Oclaro, Inc. (OCLR). AMAT’s ROI is 24.40% while OCLR has a ROI of 27.80%. The interpretation is that OCLR’s business generates a higher return on investment than AMAT’s. Cash Flow  
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 If there’s one thing investors care more about than earnings, it’s cash flow. AMAT’s free cash flow (“FCF”) per share for the trailing twelve months was +0.43. Comparatively, OCLR’s free cash flow per share was +0.15. On a percent-of-sales basis, AMAT’s free cash flow was 3.15% while OCLR converted 0% of its revenues into cash flow. This means that, for a given level of sales, AMAT is able to generate more free cash flow for investors. Liquidity and Financial Risk Balance sheet risk is one of the biggest factors to consider before investing. AMAT has a current ratio of 2.90 compared to 3.90 for OCLR. This means that OCLR can more easily cover its most immediate liabilities over the next twelve months. AMAT’s debt-to-equity ratio is 0.61 versus a D/E of 0.01 for OCLR. AMAT is therefore the more solvent of the two companies, and has lower financial risk. Valuation AMAT trades at a forward P/E of 13.18, a P/B of 7.11, and a P/S of 4.27, compared to a forward P/E of 11.16, a P/B of 2.18, and a P/S of 1.94 for OCLR. AMAT is the expensive of the two stocks on an earnings, book value and sales basis. Given that earnings are what matter most to investors, analysts tend to place a greater weight on the P/E. Analyst Price Targets and Opinions Just because a stock is cheaper doesn’t mean there’s more value to be had. In order to assess value we need to compare the current price to where it’s likely to trade in the future. AMAT is currently priced at a -15.14% to its one-year price target of 68.24. Comparatively, OCLR is -26.41% relative to its price target of 9.58. This suggests that OCLR is the better investment over the next year. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 1.80 for AMAT and 1.80 for OCLR, which implies that analysts are equally bullish on their outlook for the two stocks. Risk and Volatility Beta is an important measure that gives investors a sense of the market risk associated with a particular stock. A beta above 1 signals above average market risk, while a beta below 1 implies below average volatility. AMAT has a beta of 1.84 and OCLR’s beta is 1.39. OCLR’s shares are therefore the less volatile of the two stocks. Insider Activity and Investor Sentiment Comparing the number of shares sold short to the float is a method analysts often use to get a reading on investor sentiment. AMAT has a short ratio of 1.05 compared to a short interest of 6.91 for OCLR. This implies that the market is currently less bearish on the outlook for AMAT. Summary Oclaro, Inc. (NASDAQ:OCLR) beats Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) on a total of 8 of the 14 factors compared between the two stocks. OCLR is growing fastly, higher liquidity and has lower financial risk. In terms of valuation, OCLR is the cheaper of the two stocks on an earnings, book value and sales basis, OCLR is more undervalued relative to its price target. Finally, KLAC has better sentiment signals based on short interest.

     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that AMAT may be headed in the future. Fortunately, there is way to use the speed and magnitude of these price changes to predict future performance, thanks to what are known as momentum indicators. As momentum slows, it might be a sign that a support or resistance level has been reached, and that a trend is about to reverse. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for AMAT is 60.62%, which suggests that the stock is not particularly expensive or cheap, and not predisposed to a reactive price movement based on this measure. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 48.55%, tells a similar story, and suggests that AMAT currently trades in neutral territory. What do the trading volumes reveal? Analysts use volume trends to assess the level of conviction behind a stock’s price changes. When volumes suddenly increase above normal levels, it can be a sign that investors feel very strongly in one way or the other about the future direction of a stock, or may even have access to inside information. Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT) average trading volume of 9,933,809 during the past month is 0.3% below its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been less active than usual in the stock in recent times. What do the analysts think? AMAT is currently undervalued by -15.14% relative to the average 1-year price target of $68.24 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 1.80, which implies that analysts are generally bullish in their outlook for AMAT over the next year. How risky is the stock?  No study on the valuation of a stock is complete without taking into account risk. When analyzing the systematic risk associated with a stock, analysts look at beta, which measures the stock’s volatility relative to the overall market. Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) has a beta of 1.84, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are more extreme than the market as a whole. AMAT therefore has a above average level of market risk. During the past couple of weeks, AMAT average daily volatility was 28.16%, which is -0.36 percentage points higher than the average volatility over the past 100 days.

Important Technical Indicators to keep in Focus:- A statistical measure of the dispersion of returns (volatility) for AMAT producing salvation in Investors mouth, it has week volatility of 3.24% and for the month booked as 2.39%. Regardless of which metric you utilize, a firm understanding of the concept of volatility and how it is measured is essential to successful investing.

Many value investors look for stocks with a high percent of insider ownership, under the theory that when management are shareholders, they will act in its own self interest, and create shareholder value in the long-term. This aligns the interests of shareholders with management, thus benefiting everyone. While this sounds great in theory, high insider ownership can actually lead to the opposite result, a management team that is unaccountable because they can keep their jobs under almost any circumstance. Currently Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT)’s shares owned by insiders are 0.20%, whereas shares owned by institutional owners are 81.60%.

 Investors in Applied Materials, Inc.AMAT need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Dec 1, 2017 $47.00 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today. What is Implied Volatility? Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy. What do the Analysts Think? Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Applied Materials shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Applied Materials is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in the Semiconductor Equipment - Wafer Fabrication industry that ranks in the Top 2% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, six analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while none have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 91 cents per share to 98 cents in that period. Given the way analysts feel about Applied Materials right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there's a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.

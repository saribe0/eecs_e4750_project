Mario Tama/Getty Images  Shares of Amazon could reach $1,450 in the next 12 months, Goldman Sachs said in a note to clients Tuesday morning. It’s the highest price target on Wall Street, according to Bloomberg.  "We continue to believe Amazon’s pace of innovation, increasing pricing flexibility, and an aging corporate technology base, will drive the ongoing shift of workloads into the cloud,” analyst Heath Terry said. “We remain Buy-rated (CL) and raise our 12-month price target to $1,450 from $1,300."  The bank’s note comes on the first day of Amazon’s re:INVENT conference, hosted by its Web Services unit, one of its fastest-growing businesses.  "On top of its rapid pace of innovation and its penetration into developers, AWS' product breadth also represents a competitive moat, in our view," the bank said. "With nearly 100 products available across regions, companies would need to combine multiple vendors to compile the list of services offered collectively by AWS."  Goldman’s new price target is the most bullish on Wall Street, according to Bloomberg data — 21% above the stock’s opening price of$1,257 on Tuesday.  Amazon Web Services Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy will give a keynote address at the conference on Wednesday, followed by Chief Technology Officer Werner Vogels on Thursday. Goldman expects those talks to have exciting new product announcements that could boost the stock’s price.  Here’s what the unit has announced at previous conferences via Goldman:  Goldman Sachs Despite Goldman's hopes, however, Jassy hinted on Twitter that Werner’s keynote will be a "deep look at the future of data and serverless," rather than a traditional keynote filled with new product releases.  Twitter You can follow Amazon’s stock price in real-time here — and be sure to follow Business Insider's tech team for updates from the event.  Amazon's stock price is up 58.87% so far this year.  Markets Insider NOW WATCH: Billionaire Alibaba CEO Jack Ma is the star of an ultra-popular kung fu film See Also:

U.S. stock futures are rising heading into the open, as Wall Street returns from the Thanksgiving holiday weekend. Retailers remain in focus, as Black Friday numbers roll in amid a fresh influx of shopping on Cyber Monday. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Macy’s Inc (NYSE:M) both continue to grab headlines this morning. At last check, Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were up 0.03%, while S&P 500 futures had gained 0.02% and Nasdaq-100 futures were off 0.07%. On the options front, volume was nearly non-existent on Friday (yes, the market was open). Overall, only about 9.2 million calls and 6.6 million puts changed hands. On the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio rose to 0.62, while the 10-day moving average hit a two-week low of 0.63. Diving into Friday’s options activity, Amazon was front and center amid retailers attracting Black Friday call options activity due to reports that holiday shoppers were on track to spend more this year than in previous shopping seasons. Macy’s was also a subject of options speculation, as analysts projected a strong performance based on a beefed up online shopping platform. Finally, Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) was in focus after reports surfaced that Broadcom Ltd (NASDAQ:AVGO) was considering boosting its takeover bid for the chipmaker.  According to Adobe Analytics, Black Friday sales are expected to have hit a record high $5 billion this year, with another $6.6 billion for online retailers on Cyber Monday. AMZN stock rallied more than 2.5% on Friday following the reports, albeit amid light holiday volume. Still, Amazon stock is still rising this morning, gaining half-a-percent in premarket activity. Amazon has dominated the retail space in recent years, especially on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, due to the convenience of shopping from home in your pajamas — it’s what I did this year, and one of the major reasons I’m bullish long-term on AMZN stock. AMZN options traders rallied behind Amazon’s continued retail dominance on Friday, with volume jumping to over 214,000 contracts, or nearly double the stock’s daily average despite an extremely light trading session. Calls made up 57% of the day’s take, which is above average daily call activity for AMZN stock during the past month. Short-term expectations through December expiration are not quite as bullish, however. The December put/call open interest ratio comes in at 1.35, with puts easily outnumbering calls among front-month options. This negativity is understandable with the shares trading near all-time highs, but these bears may get burned as AMZN rallies through the holiday season.

 The holiday season has started off on a solid note this year. With retailers offering hefty discounts, online sales during Thanksgiving and Black Friday hit all-time highs. Per GBH Insights, the retailer Amazon.com Inc. AMZN  dominated online sales during Black Friday and accounted for 45-50% sales. The company raked in more than $1 billion sales in just 24 hours. Amazon stated that on Thanksgiving day, orders via mobiles increased more than 50% than the year-ago period.   A Look at the Sales Figures  According to Adobe Analytics, U.S. retailers garnered $7.9 billion from Thanksgiving and Black Friday sales, up 17.9% year over year. While Thanksgiving sales increased 18.3% year over year to $2.9 billion, Black Friday sales increased 16.9% to $5 billion. Further, Adobe expects Cyber Monday to be the biggest ever U.S. online shopping day with roughly $6.6 billion of sales. Per commerce marketing firm Criteo, purchases through mobile phones accounted for 40% of sales during Black Friday, up from 29% last year. The figure for Thanksgiving day was 46%, reflecting a 15% year-over-year increase, per Adobe. According to retail analysts and consultants, laptops, toys TVs and gaming consoles, especially PlayStation 4 were among the heavily discounted as well as best-selling products.  makeArticleAd(); Why is Amazon Stealing the Show?  Amazon offers around 480 million products of various brands, categories, genres and prices. Around 50 million products qualify for free two-day shipping to Prime members. Moreover, Prime Air, Trucks, pickup locations and artificial intelligence are all driving efficient logistics at Amazon. Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) is also part of this.  Amazon.com, Inc. Net Income (TTM)         Amazon.com, Inc. Net Income (TTM)    |      Amazon.com, Inc. Quote   Most importantly, the Whole Foods acquisition is helping Amazon to deliver a great omnichannel experience and tap the growing number of online grocery shoppers. Shares of the Zacks Rank 3 (Hold) company have rallied 58.1% year to date, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's 16.7% gain.     You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here  .  Amazon leaves no stone unturned to understand the evolving customer pattern. In this regard, the company has been accumulating data over the years to keep a tab on customers. It is therefore well positioned to cross promote products, drive deals on its platform, sell more Prime subscriptions and increase sales.  Performance of Other Retailers  In anticipation of a decline in footfall at brick-and-mortar stores, traditional retailers have been enhancing their websites, tightening inventories and ramping up delivery options. Interestingly their efforts have paid off well. Kohl's KSS  declared that it had a "record-breaking" Thanksgiving day sales, both offline and online, with more than 126 million visits to kohls.com. On Black Friday, online orders that were picked up in stores, increased 40% year over year. J. C. Penney JCP  also witnessed a double-digit increase in traffic on jcp.com last week. On Thanksgiving Day, it received the largest number of visits. Macy's M  is said to have sold more than 1 million coats, fleece jackets and sweaters by the end of the week. According to retail research firm ShopperTrak, store traffic fell less than 1% on Black Friday, narrower than industry predictions. The National Retail Federation forecasted a strong holiday sale this year and we will have a clearer picture when it releases Thanksgiving, Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales numbers on Nov 28.  What's Driving the Wheel?  Consumers are looking at convenience factors more than ever this year. Lower-priced goods, free shipping and product availability are the primary factors driving online shopping this season. Strong economic indicators like record job data and declining unemployment rate are encouraging shoppers to spend more online. Per the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the domestic economy generated 261,000 new jobs in October, the highest so far in 2017. Also, the unemployment rate of 4.1% in the month is the lowest this year. Impressive third-quarter results and record quarterly GDP numbers reflect the economy's financial strength. Additionally, personal income increased by $66.9 billion or 0.4% in September, while disposable personal income that measures the total amount of money available for use after taxes rose by $73.6 billion, or 2.1%, in the third quarter, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.  Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric   Cars?  Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge. With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.   It's not the one you think.

http://247wallst.com/retail/2017/11/27/cyber-monday-sales-rocket-to-6-6-billion/


By Douglas A. McIntyre November 27, 2017 10:55 pm EST

 Cyber Monday sales, critical to e-commerce revenue for the holiday season, surged 16.8% to $6.59 billion, according to industry research. The data also show that total online sales have topped $1 billion every day in November. According to Adobe Analytics, which tracks activity from 80 of the 100 largest e-commerce sites: Cyber Monday is projected to hit a new record as the largest online sales day in history with $6.59 billion by the end of the day. This marks a 16.8 percent year-over-year (YoY) increase as of 10:00 p.m. ET. In comparison, Black Friday and Thanksgiving Day brought in $5.03 billion and $2.87 billion in revenue respectively. The other notable information from Cyber Monday is the extent to which consumers have used smartphones to access retail sites this holiday season: Overall web traffic to retail sites increased by 11.9 percent on Cyber Monday, with the season average at 5.7 percent. Mobile set a new record representing 47.4 percent of visits (39.9 percent smartphones, 7.6 percent tablets) and 33.1 percent of revenue (24.1 percent smartphones, 9.0 percent tablets). Smartphone traffic specifically grew 22.2 percent YoY while revenue coming from smartphones ($1.12 billion) saw 39.2 percent growth YoY, a new all-time high. This trend should worry already decimated brick-and-mortal retailers. In recent years, consumers have visited stores to look at merchandise only to shop online and buy products from e-commerce sites, particularly Amazon. The practice, known as showrooming, has been difficult to combat. Because they are portable, smartphones allow people to look at merchandise in stores and buy at better prices online, almost instantaneously. Mickey Mericle, Vice President, Marketing and Customer Insights at Adobe, said: Shopping and buying on smartphones is becoming the new norm and can be attributed to continued optimizations in the retail experience on mobile devices and platforms. Consumers are also becoming more savvy and efficient online shoppers. People increasingly know where to find the best deals and what they want to purchase, which results in less price matching behavior typically done on desktops. Millennials were likely another reason for the dramatic growth in mobile, with 75 percent expecting to shop via their smartphone. Toy retailers have another reason to be concerned because of the deep discounts they have to offer. Toys “R” Us recently filed Chapter 11. The Adobe data show just how troubling the toy discount problem has become: Largest price drops heading into Cyber Monday were for toys with an average discount of 18.8 percent, followed by TVs at 21.1 percent and computers at 14.7 percent. Black Friday saw the largest discounts in computers (15.9 percent on average), followed by TVs (21.6 percent) and toys (17.3 percent). On Giving Tuesday, pet products as well as furniture and bedding are expected to see the best deals with 22 and 13 percent respectively The trend is relentlessly negative for traditional retailers. People not only buy online. They also use online shopping to look for discounts while they stand on showroom floors. The brick-and-mortar retailers are left with almost no defense of their century-old business model. By Douglas A. McIntyre

Source: Shutterstock When Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) bought struggling Whole Foods Market, it sent shockwaves through the markets. Everything from grocery stocks to dollar stores temporarily fell, while AMZN stock just keep moving higher. Whole Foods was a strategic move for Amazon in that it created certain synergies with Amazon’s existing and future business plans, and would only benefit AMZN stock. Which raises the question – who’s next? There are several struggling companies out there that Amazon could scoop up with very little expense on its part. The first that comes to mind is Rite Aid Corporation (NYSE:RAD). We already know that Rite Aid sold off almost 2,000 stores. However, it still has some 2,500 stores remaining and a pharmacy benefit management business. There has been speculation that pharmacy benefit management would be the next move for AMZN stock. So many pharmacies and Obamacare plans are on the 90-day maintenance medication model, in which orders are placed online and delivered. This fits right into Amazon’s world. But to do this, Amazon must obtain state pharmacy licenses as well as the infrastructure to sell drugs in a manner approved by the federal government. Why reinvent the wheel when it can be purchased? By purchasing Rite Aid, Amazon would instantly have 19 state licenses, the infrastructure therein, and 2,500 stores in its pocket, along with six distribution centers. There’s even more synergy. Those 2,500 stores could now become Amazon locker locations, as well as a place for returns. Amazon could pay the $6-10 billion for Rite Aid, including debt, from the $24 billion cash hoard it has; draw down more debt to fund it; or buy RAD stock using AMZN stock. Another rumor floating around is that Amazon might buy Macy’s, Inc. (NYSE:M). The general idea is that Macy’s is a retailer, just like Amazon, and it skews toward older people. Thus, Amazon would increase its demographic exposure. Second, Macy’s has hidden value in its real estate and can serve as more warehouse and same-day pickup space.

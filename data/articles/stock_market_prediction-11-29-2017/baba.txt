Occupied West BankÂ - Jabal al-Baba only really reveals itself once you start walking through it. You notice that a depression in the rocky landscape contains a small cluster of wood-and-metal shelters. Further down the unpaved track, another home sits next to a pen of sheep and goats. The village, on a tree-lined hilltop east of Jerusalem, is a legacy of the creation of Israel. Bedouin families displaced from the southern Negev desert ended up here, in what was to become the occupied West Bank. And now they face displacement again. The Israeli military has issued an eviction order for the entire village - an instrument originally designed for use against illegal Israeli settlement outposts. This week, the Palestinian Authority set up a meeting in the village. The head of the PA's commission on settlements and the separation wall vowed to fight for its survival. That's something the villagers themselves have grown used to. Adnan Jahaleen is the owner of the shelter next to the livestock pen. On the fringe of the village, he says his home has been demolished three times since 2014 by Israeli forces who accuse him of trying to expand its territory. "They demolish the house and say if you want to live, live with the rest of them uphill," he tells us. The new eviction notice dispenses with such home-by-home measures - it's a blanket threat to Jaba al-Baba's existence. In a statement to Al Jazeera, the Israeli military said it was merely acting against "the illegal construction phenomenon in the area". For Fouad Halaq, a member of the PLO negotiations department, the aim is clear; to facilitate the expansion of the nearby mega-settlement of Maale Adumim, helping to encircle Jerusalem, and split the occupied West Bank in two. He also notes the timing, as the Trump administration prepares to unveil its proposal for restarting the peace process, early next year: "They create facts on the ground and say, 'This is the situation now, you have to accept it.'" A legal challenge is under way, though. Its author, Netta Amar-Shiff, a lawyer with the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), is optimistic that it will at least delay any demolitions. In the meantime, Jabal al Baba's residents are doing what they do at this time every year - preparing for the cold winter to come.

Alibaba Group Holding Limited BABA) recently announced that it intends to sell U.S. dollar-denominated senior unsecured notes in an underwritten registered public offering. The interest rate, conversion rate and certain other terms of the notes are yet to be determined. The Chinese e-commerce goliath stated that the net proceeds would be used for general corporate purposes. On a year-to-date basis, shares of Alibaba have steadily treaded higher. The stock has returned 117.7% compared with the industry’s gain of 65.6%. Alibaba’s Cash Position As of Sep 30, 2017, the company had cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of almost RMB159.9 (US$24.0 million) billion compared with RMB148.2 (US$21.9 million) in the prior quarter. Also, the company generated RMB30.5 billion (US$4.59 billion) of cash from operations and RMB22.5 billion (US$3.4 billion) of non-GAAP free cash flow. We believe that the company has a strong balance sheet, which will help it in capitalizing on investment opportunities and pursuing strategic acquisitions, further improving its growth prospects. Moreover, the senior notes offering will bring down the company’s cost of capital, thus strengthening its balance sheet and supporting growth. Bottom Line Alibaba Group caters mainly to its native market. We remain positive about the company’s market position, expanding customer base androbust growth in core e-commerce business. Also, its high revenues and strong metrics growth are big positives. We believe that the company is being driven by mobile and international expansion. Alibaba Group Holding Limited Price and Consensus   Alibaba Group Holding Limited Price and Consensus | Alibaba Group Holding Limited Quote Zacks Rank and Stocks to Consider Alibaba currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

  Alibaba Group Holding Limited  's BABA  financial arm Ant Financial has imposed a ban on consumer loans with annual interest rates above 24% from its Alipay platform, with China tightening regulations related to the Internet lending industry. We observe that Alibaba stock has gained 114.2% year to date, substantially outperforming the 65% rally of the industry  it belongs to.    China's government is trying to cut down problems associated with online loans such as abusive collection methods, default risks and diversion of loan funds to real estate market. Ant Financial's move comes on the heels of People's Bank of China and China Banking regulatory commission's decision to impose stricter regulations on Internet micro loans that have been proliferating over the past year taking advantage of weak regulations. The government has asked provincial authorities to suspend issuance of new licenses for online consumer loan companies and stop the non-compliant ones.  What's Behind the Move  Ant Financial said in a statement," Our inspections discovered that products recommended by a few merchants on Lifestyle have problems such as interest rates that exceed the legal limit and inappropriate collection methods." So basically, the move appears to be part of Ant Financial's efforts to impose better monitoring and remove inferior loan offerings from its platform. It has asked all to perform self-checks by Nov 30.  Alibaba Group Holding Limited Revenue (TTM)         Alibaba Group Holding Limited Revenue (TTM)    |      Alibaba Group Holding Limited Quote   Notably, China's Supreme People's Court ruled in 2015 that collection of loans with annual interest rate up to 24% would be enforced by the courts. Interest rates of up to 36% are legally allowed but collection would not be enforced by courts. Lenders have to find their own collection methods in case of default. That being said, the move underscores a conservative approach on Ant Financials' part to preserve its ongoing partnerships under a situation where it is still not clear how regulators will act. We believe that increased government regulations will affect Alibaba and Ant Financial backed Chinese online lender, Qudian. This U.S. listed company offers small cash and merchandise credit products to college students and young workers.  Zacks Rank and Stocks to Consider  Alibaba shares currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Activision Blizzard ATVI  , Applied Materials AMAT  and Twitter TWTR  , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2. You can see   the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy)   stocks here  .  Long-term earnings per share growth rate for Activision, Applied Materials and Twitter is projected to be 13.8%, 13.3% and 21.5%, respectively.

Source: Shutterstock Shares of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA) closed at an all time high Friday at $191.19. This follows an impressive 26% run up from the Aug. 11 lows and an even more impressive 117% gain since the beginning of the year for BABA stock. While Alibaba is unquestionably the dominant player in the Chinese e-commerce space, the stock has come too far, too fast and is due for a period of consolidation. A quick look at valuation levels for BABA stock certainly should give investors pause for concern. Alibaba is definitely not a value stock, sporting a extremely rich current P/E ratio of 53.6. Even the forward P/E of 37.3 is still decidedly in nosebleed territory, far eclipsing the 21.2 forward P/E for the S&P 500. The current price-to-sales ratio of 16.5 borders on the ludicrous, especially given that BABA has a market cap fast approaching half a trillion dollars. Alibaba now has 488 million annual active users, a staggering number indeed. Revenues for last quarter beat at $8.285 billion versus consensus of $7.78 billion. Growth to-date has been torrid, to say the least. Growth going forward, however, will necessarily begin to slow simply due to the law of large numbers. Let’s not forget that BABA is already priced for hyperbolic growth with that extreme 16.5 P/S ratio. A technical look at Alibaba shares also points to a likely slowdown in the most recent rally. BABA stock is now overbought on a five day RSI basis with a reading over 70.

https://www.premiumtimesng.com/entertainment/nollywood/250961-comedian-gbenga-adeyinka-apologises-baba-salas-false-death-post.html

Popular Nigerian comedian, Gbenga Adeyinka, has apologised to Nigerians for posting a false claim that veteran comedian, Moses Adejumo, popularly known as Baba Sala, died. Mr. Adeyinka issued the apology via his Instagram page where he had earlier made the false claim on Tuesday night. “Good evening please DISREGARD the news of Baba Sala’s demise. The source has since recanted. So sorry for the misinformation. “Feeling very stupid that I just took his word for it. Sorry again”, the standup comedian wrote. Adeyinka’s untrue claim was deleted soon after it was posted, but many blogs had published it without verifying from the family of Baba Sala.
When PREMIUM TIMES called Emmanuel Adejumo, one of Baba Sala’s sons on Wednesday morning, he dismissed the story as false. “It is not true that Baba is dead. He is alive .I don’t know where those peddling the death rumour got it from.” When this newspaper informed him of the news as reported by the comedian and asked him to call his father, he said, “How can I call my dad when I am right next to him. Baba is very much alive.Thank you for calling.” This is the second time in less than six months that such rumour would be peddled about the comedian. In August, a similar rumour was published by many blogs, however, it was swiftly debunked by Emmanuel.

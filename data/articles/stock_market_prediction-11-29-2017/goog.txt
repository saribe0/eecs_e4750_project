The U.S. economy is still on a tear, but businesses have stopped taking out loans from banks despite predictions that banks were bound to have a big year from that department. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Snap Inc (NYSE:SNAP) and Time Inc (NYSE:TIME) all made headlines during the weekend by developing a new feature, updating its social media app and agreeing to be bought out respectively. Here’s the skinny of it: Google has been granted a patent for a new feature that can track its user’s faces. Future Alphabet devices may come with the company’s latest technology, which consists of a smart, motorized lid attached to its Pixelbooks, which are laptop-tablet hybrids. The functionality hones in on the device’s user when they are nearby and opens up in the right configuration. It unlocks the device when necessary, while also keeping track of a user’s face as the lid is always aligned to the owner’s face. The patent — which Google filed for in 2013 — may be in a future Pixelbook and it works in a number of ways. It can tell when a user is nearby or when they are leaving the room. Its technology may use a wide-angle rear camera, a proximity sensor, a Bluetooth sensor or multiple of these. Users may also have the option of tapping a special area on the lid to authenticate and open it. The feature may use various techniques to recognize its users, including facial, fingerprint and voice recognition. One may also open the device through an authorized device such as a smartwatch or smartphone. GOOG stock gained 13.6% over the last three months and GOOGL shares rose 13.5% over the same span. Snap has rolled out a new algorithm designed to improve its app. Snapchat is already capable of placing your exact location on a map if you turn on the device’s mapping features, and now the social media company has found new ways to bolster your pictures with filters. The app now looks at what you are taking a picture of and suggests a filter or sticker that would work well with the images, shading, light and borders featured in your image.

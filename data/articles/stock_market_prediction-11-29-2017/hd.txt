Harley-Davidson's 2017 Battle of the Kings custom bike competition was full of amazing entries. Roughly 200 H-D dealerships from around the world built Sportster-based customs this year with an eye on taking home the big prize – and bragging rights – from EICMA 2017. One of the more unique bikes entered isn’t really a bike at all, but a drift-chewing, ice racing snow machine built by Harley-Davidson of Banska Bystrica. Banska Bystrica is an old copper mining town located on the banks of the Hron River in Central Slovakia. Primarily a tourist spot now, the picturesque city gets a fair amount of snow due to its proximity to the Low Tatra, Veľká Fatra, and Kremnica Mountains. It makes a certain amount of sense then that the crew at H-DBB built a snow bike for the competition rather than a road-going bike. To make their radical custom, the H-DBB crew started by stripping down a donor XL 1200 CX. The front wheel and rear swingarm were then removed and tossed into the corner to make room for the snowmobile parts. A single ski conversion was mounted to the forks, and the rear skid-frame system was installed with its own suspension. Since the Roadster's drive belt is on the right side, a conversion was done to move said belt to the left side to accommodate the snowbelt kit. The snowbelt came with its own brakes, so the Roadster's stock brakes – including the ABS – were eighty-sixed to make room. After the mechanical bits were sorted, the crew moved on to the cosmetic work. A new “blue smoke” vinyl wrap was made to cover the tank, forks, side-panels, headlight cowl, tail, and part of the snowbelt kit. A secondary LED light was mounted beneath the aftermarket headlight, and a new intake and skid plate were added. Once that was done, all there was left to do was take their new snowbike out for a rip on some ski slopes. You can check out one of their videos below, and it's definitely worth your while.

2017-11-29T11:41:29.332Z  After much speculation, Capcom confirmed Okami HD in September—a reworked and repolished version of the 2006 original that's due on December 12. It'll support 4K resolution on capable PCs, and now has a trio of new trailers.  The first, named Celestial Brush: Inferno, teases environment manipulation and a majestic pipe-smoking bird: 
 The second, named Celestial Brush: Veil of Mist, appears to portray sacrificial slaughter and nightmarish, spike-studded spiders: And the third, named Demon Introduction No. 5, shows off an arena boss battle with a four-legged, dual-wielding samurai beast: If you're new to Okami know that the above makes marginally more sense in English, but that it's a wonderful game in any event.   Again, Okami HD is due in Europe and the US on December 12, 2017 Thanks, All Games Delta.

In recent trading, shares of JPMorgan Chase & Co (Symbol: JPM) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $100.00, changing hands for $101.36/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.      10 ETFs With Most Upside To Analyst Targets »

JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) trades at $101.36 having a market capitalization of $352.84 billion. JPM stock price climbed 29.42% over the past year, yielding a positive weighted alpha of 25.3 percent. Since an alpha above 1 hints at more gains, investors can predict some further rally scope.  Weighted Alpha is used to calculate how much a share has gone up or down over a certain period, normally a year. In general, more thrust is placed on most recent actions by assigning higher weights to it than those assigned to past movements. This assists to give a return figure that has a stronger focus on the most current period and is thus a better measure for short-term analysis. This technique is highly famous among technical analysts. If the stock is up it will have a positively weighted alpha. If the stock price is unchanged its weighted alpha will be smaller. A stock price loss will yield a negatively weighted alpha.  Support is likely to come between $98.99 a share to $96.61 a share level. However, if the JPM shares go below $96.61 then it would indicate a much weaker market for the company. In that case, its shares would mark a 4.69% decline from the most recent price. The typical day in the last two weeks has seen about a 1.46% volatility. The average volume for JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) has been 11.65 million shares per day over the past 30 days. JPM has a 1-week performance of 2.37%. JPM price is down nearly -1.05% from its 52-week high price of $102.42 a share but is up about 23.03% from its 52-week low price of $78.02 a share.  Lannett Company, Inc. (NYSE:LCI) has accumulated 2.37% over the course of one week. It seems that Lannett Company, Inc. (NYSE:LCI) might see muted action given an ABR of 2.6 or Hold rating. Analysts, on average, seem bearish as they suggest LCI is worth $-0.57 less, giving a target price of $26.08 a share. JPM share have rallied by 17.46% in percentage terms since the start of the year – and retreated -0.4% in the last month. Volume in the last session has decreased compared with JPM’s average trading volume. We think the decreased volume is representative of sellers as it has displayed in many other cases.  LCI’s Stochastic Oscillator (%D) is at 86.61%. Values of %D line that are above 80 indicate that the security is overbought; prices could well fall in the near future. And the values below 20 that it is oversold indicate prices could very well bounce upwards. The Stochastic Oscillator is a powerful technical tool that is somewhat surprisingly easy to understand. In a basic sense, it is used by technicians to measure the speed or momentum of the price movement. It represents the location of the previous close relative to the price range over a set number of periods. This can be more easily understood, however, by pulling apart the two lines on the stochastic oscillator and explaining the simple underlying mathematical formulas. The first line is called the %K line, which analyzes the actual price movements in the shares and can be defined as: %K = (Current Close – Lowest Low)/(Highest High – Lowest Low) * 100. The second line, the %D line is simple a 3-day moving average of the %K line. There are three primary ways to read the Stochastic Oscillator in search of entry points, but traders should follow the %D line closely because that indicates major trends on the chart.  Lannett Company, Inc. (NYSE:LCI)’s latest quote $26.65 $3.43 3.5% will find technical support in $25.83 a share and a breakdown below this region would be a significantly bearish signal for Lannett Company, Inc. traders. Any way you dice it, a dip below $25.02 a share would be very bad news for LCI’s technical picture in the near-term. The $25.02 level represents at least another 6.12% downside for the stock from its current price. If Lannett Company, Inc. (NYSE:LCI) shares can stay above the price resistance around $27.08 a share, that could help propel Lannett Company, Inc. (NYSE:LCI) higher to the next line of resistance at $27.52 a share. The typical day in the last one month has seen about a 6.25% volatility. LCI is down around 44.09% from its 12-month high of $14.9 notched on Aug 15, 2017 but is -284.32% above its highest point the past 12 months of $102.42 a share.

Photographer: Darren Soh/Bloomberg Two former JPMorgan Chase & Co. foreign-exchange option traders will start a quantitative hedge fund in January, using artificial intelligence to trade currency options. Atsuo Ogaki and Damien Loh have established Ensemble Capital Pte Ltd. in Singapore with capital $75 million from high-net worth investors, family offices and institutional investors, Ogaki, who has taken the chief executive officer role, said in an interview.  The fund aims to generate annual returns of 15 percent, Ogaki said. “We want to stick to our original objective as a hedge fund to pursue absolute return and eliminate correlations with traditional asset classes.” A guide to the many flavors of quant funds: QuickTake scorecard Ogaki joined Chase Manhattan Bank, the precursor to JPMorgan, in 1988, where he spent 23 years trading currency options before moving to the foreign-exchange department of Nomura Securities in 2010. Loh had 15 years as a currency options trader at JPMorgan before co-founding Ensemble, where he will be chief investment officer. Ensemble aims to generate returns through machine learning and deep-learning artificial intelligence -- analyzing factors including seasonality, asset relationships and economic data. It will also use AI to forecast currency options, including direction, range, conviction and time period. The hot new hedge fund model is ‘quantamental’: QuickTake Q&A Tests showed the model produced an annualized return of 12.7 percent after fees over the past 10 years, and a Sharpe ratio -- which measures a fund’s performance adjusted for risk -- of 1.34 percent. Ensemble will initially trade options of Group-of-10 and emerging Asian currencies. It plans to expand into interest-rate options, swaps and then commodity and equity indexes, Ogaki said. The fund will start with seven staff, including Ogaki and Loh. “As long as our budget allows, we want to hire as many data scientists as possible as this will be the key to our business,” Ogaki said.

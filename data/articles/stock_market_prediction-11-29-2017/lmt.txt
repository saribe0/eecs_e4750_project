http://www.usacommercedaily.com/2017/11/29/todays-analyst-moves-msg-networks-inc-msgn-lockheed-martin-corporation-lmt/

Shares of MSG Networks Inc. (NYSE:MSGN) observed rebound of 9.29% since bottoming out on Nov. 15, 2017. Thanks to a rise of almost 2.32% in the past five days, the stock price is now down -17.91% so far on the year — still in weak territory. In this case, shares are down -30.24% , the 52-week high touched on Apr. 27, 2017, but are collecting gains at -10.41% for the past 12 months.  Brokerage houses, on average, are recommending investors to hold MSG Networks Inc. (MSGN)’s shares projecting a $23.75 target price. Analysts‟ target price forecasts are a prediction of a stock‟s future price, generally over the 12 months following the release date (Asquith et al., 2005). This forecast is a point estimate that provides investors with a benchmark against which to directly compare stock price in the short run.Target prices made by analysts employed by large brokers, who have access to a greater resource pool, are more likely to be met over the 12-month forecast period.  MSGN’s revenue has declined at an average annualized rate of about -12.1% during the past five years. However, the company’s most recent quarter increase of 2.5% looks unattractive. The sales growth rate for a stock is a measure of how the stock’s sales per share (SPS) has grown over a specific period of time. It tells an investor how quickly a company is increasing its revenues. The sales growth rate helps investors determine how strong the overall growth-orientation is for a stock or portfolio.   The best measure of a company is its profitability, for without it, it cannot grow, and if it doesn’t grow, then its stock will trend downward. Increasing profits are the best indication that a company can pay dividends and that the share price will trend upward. Creditors will loan money at a cheaper rate to a profitable company than to an unprofitable one; consequently, profitable companies can use leverage to increase stockholders’ equity even more. Profitability ratios compare different accounts to see how efficiently a business is generating profits. These ratios show how well income is generated through operations, and are important to both creditors and investors. They help determine the company’s ability to continue operating. Currently, MSG Networks Inc. net profit margin for the 12 months is at 24.77%. Comparatively, the peers have a net margin -3.58%, and the sector’s average is 14.63%. In that light, it seems in good position compared to its peers and sector. The profit margin measures the amount of net income earned with each dollar’s worth of revenue. It shows the percentage of sales that remain after all of the company’s expenses have been paid. The higher the ratio, the better.  Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) is another stock that is grabbing investors attention these days. Its shares have trimmed -0.99% since hitting a peak level on Oct. 13, 2017. Thanks to an increase of almost 3.57% in the past one month, the stock price is now outperforming with 27.63% so far on the year — still in strong zone. In this case, shares are 29.94% higher, the worst price in 52 weeks suffered on Dec. 12, 2016, and are keeping their losses at 13.47% for the past six months.  The good news is there’s still room for Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT) to grow. At recent closing price of $319.01, LMT has a chance to add $9.84 or 3.08% in 52 weeks, based on mean target price ($328.85) placed by analysts.The analyst consensus opinion of 2.3 looks like a hold. It has a 36-month beta of 0.57 , so you might not be in for a bumpy ride.  For the past 5 years, Lockheed Martin Corporation’s EPS growth has been nearly 9.6%. Sure, the percentage is encouraging but better times are ahead as looking out over a next 5-year period, analysts expect the company to see its earnings go up by 4.64%, annually.  Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT)’s ROE is 162.99%, while industry’s is 47.76%. The average ROE for the sector stands at 13.77%. The return on equity (ROE), also known as return on investment (ROI), is the best measure of the return, since it is the product of the operating performance, asset turnover, and debt-equity management of the firm. If a firm can borrow money and use it to achieve a higher return than the cost of the debt, then the leveraging creates additional revenue that accrues to stockholders as increased equity.  Lockheed Martin Corporation’s ROA is 7.38%, while industry’s average is 2.59%. As with any return, the higher this number the better. However, it, too, needs to be taken into the context of a company’s peer group as well as its sector. The average return on assets for companies in the same sector is 5.52. The return on assets (ROA) (aka return on total assets, return on average assets), is one of the most widely used profitability ratios because it is related to both profit margin and asset turnover, and shows the rate of return for both creditors and investors of the company. ROA shows how well a company controls its costs and utilizes its resources.

http://www.nasdaq.com/article/lockheed-martin-lmt-secures-21m-deal-from-us-air-force-cm883724

  Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT  has won a modification contract for the C-130J center wing box replacement program. This contract has been awarded by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Robins Air Force Base, GA.  makeArticleAd(); Contract Details    Per the $21.3 million modification, Lockheed Martin will support the purchase of an additional quantity of five each C-130J center wing boxes, five each component kits and a project management review.    With this modification, the total cumulative face value of the contract reaches $72.7 million.    Work related to the deal will be carried out in Marietta and Atlanta, GA. The contract will use fiscal 2018 aircraft procurement funds to complete the deal by Sep 4, 2021.   A Brief Note on C-130J    C-130J Super Hercules is the latest model in Lockheed Martin's Hercules family. It is a four-engine turboprop military transport aircraft. The C-130J's crew includes only two pilots and one loadmaster because no navigator or flight engineer is required on the aircraft. Among its missions, the C-130J counts capabilities as diverse as special ops, aerial refueling, close air support, search and rescue, and personal recovery.    The J-model is almost similar to the classic Hercules in terms of general appearance. However, it uses updated technology like the new Rolls-Royce AE 2100 D3 turboprops from Rolls-Royce Holdings plc that comes with the Dowty R391 composite scimitar propellers, digital avionics and reduced crew requirements. These improvements have boosted its performance over C-130E/H predecessors. In particular, this latest model comes with 40% greater range, 21% higher speed and 41% reduced take-off distance.   Our View    Lockheed Martin is the largest U.S. defense contractor with a platform-centric focus that guarantees a steady inflow of follow-on orders from a leveraged presence in the Army, Air Force, Navy and IT programs. Its Aeronautics business division is engaged in the production and upgradation of advanced military aircraft including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Notably, C-130J is one of the major Aeronautics programs of the company as well as of the U.S. Air Force.    In 2016, Lockheed Martin delivered 24 C-130J aircraft, five of which were offered to international customers. As of Dec 31, 2016, the company had 88 of these aircraft in its backlog, which is anticipated to increase in the coming days courtesy of the latest won deal.    Moreover, given the recently growing demands from overseas market for this tactical aircraft, (particularly from France and Israel) we can expect the company to secure similar contracts related to C-130J jets in the days ahead.    Interestingly, in its latest quarterly results, the company's Aeronautics division witnessed revenue growth of 14%, with sales volume from C-130J program being one of the driving factors. Going ahead, given the strong demand for C-130J, more similar deals can be expected in coming days, which in turn will make the C-130J program as one of the primary growth drivers for the company.    Furthermore, the fiscal 2018 defense policy has authorized the United States to spend $700 billion on defense. This has enhanced the prospect of increased order flow from Pentagon for major defense contractors like Lockheed Martin, Raytheon Company RTN  , Northrop Grumman Corporation NOC  , The Boeing Company BA  and others.   Price Movement    Lockheed Martin's stock was up about 20% in a year compared with the broader industry  's gain of 36.7%. This underperformance could have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces for its broad portfolio of products and services domestically as well as internationally.     Zacks Rank    Lockheed Martin carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy)   stocks here   .

The contract will use fiscal 2018 aircraft procurement funds to complete the deal by Sep 4, 2021.   A Brief Note on C-130J    C-130J Super Hercules is the latest model in Lockheed Martin's Hercules family. It is a four-engine turboprop military transport aircraft. The C-130J's crew includes only two pilots and one loadmaster because no navigator or flight engineer is required on the aircraft. Among its missions, the C-130J counts capabilities as diverse as special ops, aerial refueling, close air support, search and rescue, and personal recovery.    The J-model is almost similar to the classic Hercules in terms of general appearance. However, it uses updated technology like the new Rolls-Royce AE 2100 D3 turboprops from Rolls-Royce Holdings plc that comes with the Dowty R391 composite scimitar propellers, digital avionics and reduced crew requirements. These improvements have boosted its performance over C-130E/H predecessors. In particular, this latest model comes with 40% greater range, 21% higher speed and 41% reduced take-off distance.   Our View    Lockheed Martin is the largest U.S. defense contractor with a platform-centric focus that guarantees a steady inflow of follow-on orders from a leveraged presence in the Army, Air Force, Navy and IT programs. Its Aeronautics business division is engaged in the production and upgradation of advanced military aircraft including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Notably, C-130J is one of the major Aeronautics programs of the company as well as of the U.S. Air Force.    In 2016, Lockheed Martin delivered 24 C-130J aircraft, five of which were offered to international customers. As of Dec 31, 2016, the company had 88 of these aircraft in its backlog, which is anticipated to increase in the coming days courtesy of the latest won deal.    Moreover, given the recently growing demands from overseas market for this tactical aircraft, (particularly from France and Israel) we can expect the company to secure similar contracts related to C-130J jets in the days ahead.    Interestingly, in its latest quarterly results, the company's Aeronautics division witnessed revenue growth of 14%, with sales volume from C-130J program being one of the driving factors. Going ahead, given the strong demand for C-130J, more similar deals can be expected in coming days, which in turn will make the C-130J program as one of the primary growth drivers for the company.    Furthermore, the fiscal 2018 defense policy has authorized the United States to spend $700 billion on defense. This has enhanced the prospect of increased order flow from Pentagon for major defense contractors like Lockheed Martin, Raytheon Company RTN  , Northrop Grumman Corporation NOC  , The Boeing Company BA  and others.   Price Movement    Lockheed Martin's stock was up about 20% in a year compared with the broader industry  's gain of 36.7%. This underperformance could have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces for its broad portfolio of products and services domestically as well as internationally.

IZEA Founder Ted Murphy doesn't just own Bitcoins - he mines them. Murphy weighs in on the future for the virtual currency One of the biggest stories of 2017 has been the surge in the price of bitcoin, the cryptocurrency touted as an alternative  to gold and other investments. For years, many have wondered who the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of bitcoin, is, to no avail. One person it's not? Elon Musk. In a tweet on Monday night, Musk denied being the creator of the cryptocurrency after a blog post by a former SpaceX intern claimed that the Tesla and SpaceX chief may be the creator of Bitcoin. Not true. A friend sent me part of a BTC a few years, but I don’t know where it is. NORTH KOREAN HACKERS TARGETING BITCOINS TO FUND KIM JONG UN, REPORT SAYS "Not true," Musk wrote. "A friend sent me part of a BTC [bitcoin] a few years, but I don’t know where it is." The blog post noted that the source code for the cryptocurrency was written in C++, a computer programming language, a knowledge which Musk has.  Musk did however acknowledge knowing C++ in a subsequent tweet. int main(){} Who is the creator? For years, the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto has been speculated upon. In 2016, Australian entrepreneur Craig Wright told the BBC that he was the creator.  Wright also wrote a subsequent blog post further detailing his role in creating bitcoin.  "Be assured, just as you have worked, I have not been idle during these many years," Wright wrote in the post. "Since those early days, after distancing myself from the public persona that was Satoshi, I have poured every measure of myself into research. I have been silent, but I have not been absent. I have been engaged with an exceptional group and look forward to sharing our remarkable work when they are ready." The blog post has since been taken down, though others, including early bitcoin programmer Gavin Andresen, believe Wright is the creator. In 2014, Newsweek wrote a story that it had identified Nakamoto as a then 64-year-old Japanese-American named Dorian Prentice Satoshi Nakamoto. After the story ran, there was a message posted on the P2P website by a person identifying themselves as Satoshi Nakamoto claiming that he was not Dorian Nakamoto. Newsweek later issued a statement after it received hefty amounts of criticism surrounding its story, saying it stood by the reporter and the story.  Bitcoin's worth According to the 2016 BBC report, Satoshi Nakamoto was estimated to have amassed one million Bitcoins (there are only 21 million in total). At today's prices, that would be roughly $10 billion in worth. There are approximately 16.4 million Bitcoins already in circulation, of which an estimated 3.7 million may be lost forever, worth an estimated $30 billion, according to a recent report in Digital Trends.  Follow Chris Ciaccia on Twitter @Chris_Ciaccia This story has been updated to reflect the price of one Bitcoin has surpassed $10,000.

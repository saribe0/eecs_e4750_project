After a two-month slumber, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) shares are finally perking up. And the timing of its awakening was spot on. Technical patterns suggested a pop was imminent and the holiday season is giving NFLX all the reason needed to begin a year-end run. Since launching higher in early October amid positive earnings from the tech sector, NFLX has been consolidating in a triangle pattern. Compression has been the name of the game as the stock has traded in an ever-tightening range. Chartists view this formation as a coiled spring — one with pent-up energy just waiting for a reason to release. Today was that release. And NFLX shares are shooting to the moon to make up for lost time. Today’s pop really couldn’t have come at a better time. The triangle’s apex was fast approaching, and any further dithering would have threatened to take NFLX below its 50-day moving average. In sizing up potential targets, $205 should be the first stop. That marks the top of the triangle as well as the current high water mark for Netflix shares. If buyers really press their advantage, look for the stock to move into $210 and beyond. To fully capitalize on continued strength into year-end, not to mention an increase in volatility, buy a Jan $200/$210 bull call spread for $4.15. The long vertical consists of buying to open the Jan $200 call while selling to open the $210 call. The initial cost represents the max loss and will be forfeited if Netflix sits below $200 at expiration. The max gain is $5.85 and will be captured if we rise above $210. By risking $415 to make $585, the potential return on investment is a mouth-watering 141%. As of this writing, Tyler Craig held bullish options positions in NFLX. Want more education on how to trade?

 The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For NFLX, the company currently has $1.75 Billion of cash on the books. You can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $-2.07 Billion over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to grow in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $0.41 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 86.66% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors.

Recent price movements in the stock of Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) have caught the attention of the investment community. Many experts agree that the truth about a stock is best reflected in the way it moves on the chart. For this stock, the chart has a lot to say about future performance. How has the stock performed recently? Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in the last month has increased +0.28%. Shares are now up over the past year, outperforming the broad market by -100% and outperformed a peer group of similar companies by 127%. After the latest session, which saw the stock close at a price of $195.75, NFLX sits below its 52-week high. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has been trading in a bullish manner, based on the relative positions of the stock’s 20 and 200 day moving averages. Momentum indicators 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that NFLX may be headed in the future. To forecast a stock’s future performance, analysts use momentum indicators, which take into account the size and speed of these price movements. As momentum begins to slow, it may be a sign that a recent trend is about to reverse. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for NFLX is 53.51%, which suggests that the stock is not particularly expensive or cheap, and not predisposed to a reactive price movement based on this measure. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 51.08%, tells a similar story, and suggests that NFLX currently trades in neutral territory. What do the trading volumes reveal? Price isn’t the only tool analysts use to forecast future performance. Volume patterns can also reveal some important insights. If, for instance, a stock’s volumes suddenly increase by a significant amount, it’s usually a sign that the level of conviction behind the trade is high. Investors may feel very strongly about the future direction of the stock in question. Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) average trading volume of 4,952,917 during the past month is 23.19% below its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been less active than usual in the stock in recent times. What do the analysts think? NFLX is currently undervalued by -8.46% relative to the average 1-year price target of $213.84 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 2.20, which implies that analysts are generally neutral in their outlook for NFLX over the next year. How risky is the stock?  Absolute price performance isn’t the only thing analysts consider when predicting future performance: volatility matters as well. Beta, which measures the stock’s volatility relative to the overall market, is a simple but effective metric for assessing risk. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has a beta of 1.40, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are more extreme than the market as a whole. NFLX therefore has a above average level of market risk. During the past couple of weeks, NFLX average daily volatility was 18.46%, which is 6.32 percentage points lower than the average volatility over the past 100 days.

Shares of NVIDIA Corporation NVDA have been up more than 100% this year. This is a very good ride when, you, as an investor, intend to cash in on the gain. However, we would suggest you to think twice, as the stock has plenty of potential to ride higher and generate more solid returns over the next few months.Given the recent optimism surrounding the stock, we believe it is just a matter of some months that the stock will breach the $250 mark.In fact, the company, between its Q2 and Q3 earnings results (Oct 10 to Nov 9), gained approximately 25%. Therefore, given its splendid Q3 results, the $250 mark is still a conservative view, as this only represents a 15% upside from Friday’s closing price of $216.96.Shares of NVIDIA have gained a whopping 103.3% year to date (YTD). If you still haven’t taken advantage of this appreciation yet, this is the right time to add the stock to your portfolio. Notably, NVIDIA has substantially outperformed the industry to which it belongs to, which has gained 47.2% YTD.   Bullish Analysts’ View to Aid the UpsideMajority of analysts have been optimistic about NVIDIA’s performance since the beginning of 2017 and raising their target prices quarter after quarter. The latest to join this group is Mitch Steves of RBC Capital Markets, which raised its target price to $250 from $240.Mitch noted that the recent upgrade in target price is in the wake of NVIDIA’s recently reported overwhelming third-quarter fiscal 2018 results. He believes the stock is poised to carry this bullish momentum ahead, in turn boosting the company’s share price. Mitch in his note, which was covered by Marketwatch, wrote, "Overall, after a single quarter of out-performance the 2020 upside case increases by 10%."Moreover, Mitch stated that increasing use of cryptocurrencies is driving demand for NVIDIA’s GPUs, as it helps create digital currencies like Ethereum, Monero, Cash and bitcoin gold. He believes the company will continue to witness demand for its GPUs from miners.Other investment firms, which also raised their target price recently, include B. Riley and Mizuho. While B. Riley increased its target price to $270 from $250, Mizuho raised it to $225 from $220.Most analysts believe NVIDIA will dominate the Artificial Intelligence (AI) chip market in the near future, similar to its performance in the gaming and data center markets. A few months back, Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s analyst, Vivek Arya, and Evercore ISI’s analyst — C.J. Muse — noted that NVIDIA is well poised to dominate the AI market.Arya, in a note written to clients, had mentioned, “Similar to other large successful tech industries, we expect the $30bn AI chip market to also feature one dominant supplier – we think NVDA.” On the other hand, Muse noted that the company is well poised to get the “first-mover advantage” and will continue maintaining its sturdy presence in the AI training system.Bottom LineNVIDIA remains one of the best performers in the semiconductor space. Given the accelerated momentum in AI, gaming, datacenter and automotive technology, we believe this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, with long-term EPS growth estimate of 11.2%, will continue to rally in the near term. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Many might argue that NVIDIA, with its hefty forward P/E valuation of 52.6x, compared with the industry average of 20.3x, is a risky bet. Nevertheless, we beg to differ as high valuations and increasing share prices do not necessarily indicate that the stock does not have much upside potential left.NVIDIA has grabbed attention with striking performances on the back of impressive earnings results and strong growth projections.Furthermore, with its continued efforts toward attaining robust position in several emerging industries such as AI, deep learning and driverless cars industry, NVIDIA has outpaced other competitors in the space, including Advanced Micro Devices AMD, Intel Corp. INTC and STMicroelectronics STM, in terms of growth.Therefore, we believe investing in this stock will yield promising returns for your portfolio in the short term.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) is an interesting player in the Technology space, with a focus on Semiconductor – Specialized. The stock has been active on the tape, currently trading at $214.14, down from yesterday’s close by -1.30%. Given the stock’s recent action, it seemed like a good time to take a closer look at the company’s recent data. Fundamental Analysis It’s important to get a feel for how any stock is actually valued on the market based on its core numbers. NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) currently trades with a market capitalization of $128.55 Billion. That value represents a market adjusting for revenues that have been growing by 31.54 % on a quarterly year/year basis as of the company’s last quarterly report. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For NVDA, the company currently has $2.8 Billion of cash on the books, which is offset by $28 Million current liabilities. You can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $2.64 Billion over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to fall in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $1.15 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 66.94% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors. Technical Analysis Sometimes, we can understand most about a stock by simply looking at how it has been trading. Looking at the stock’s movement on the chart, NVIDIA Corporation recorded a 52-week high of $218.67. It is now trading 4.53% off that level. The stock is trading $196.82 its 50-day moving average by -17.32%. The stock carved out a 52-week low down at $84.77. In recent action, NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) has made a move of +6.08% over the past month, which has come on weak relative transaction volume. Over the trailing year, the stock is underperforming the S&P 500 by 18.2, and it’s gotten there by action that has been more volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. In terms of the mechanics underlying that movement, traders will want to note that the stock is trading on a float of 2.21% with $578.75 Million sitting short, betting on future declines. That suggests something of the likelihood of a short squeeze in shares of NVDA.

Also, the equity price jumped 27.94% % in three months, taking the six-month increase to 45.97% as of recent close. With that said, researchers took a deep dive into the hotly debated question: is it too late to buy NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).  Analyst research firms are expressing bullish stance on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s near-term growth potential. They anticipate the NVDA stock will hit $211.43 on a short term (12 month) basis.

Valued currently at $210.71, the vast majority of Wall Street analysts continue to say it’s a hold. Mean recommendation is rated on a 1 to 5 scale. 1 is equivalent to a buy rating, 3 a hold rating, and 5 a sell rating.

From another technical standpoint, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) has reached 56.2, putting it inside a neutral zone. If the RSI is traveling up and it is between 40 and 80, it is probably an indication of an uptrend. If it moves beyond 70 but cannot hold this ground and instead falls below 70, it could be an indication that the market is overbought and prone to become bearish, at least in the short term. Conversely, if the RSI is traveling down and it is between 60 and 20, it is probably an indication of a downtrend. If it moves below 30 and fails to remain below, it could be an indication that the market is oversold and poised to become bullish, at least in the short term.  Technical analysts also use volume to predict trends. The current trading volume of 12.79 sits 12.04% lower than the past 3 month’s readings, indicating near-term traders have been less active toward NVDA than usual of late. The company trades on average around 1433000 shares per market session. Major moves in volume can signal unusual activity, such as insider trading. Unusual volume can be a major signal that investment gurus and momentum traders are piling into a stock ahead of a catalyst. These types of traders like to get in well ahead of a large spike, so it’s always a smart move to monitor unusual volume. In terms of relative volume, these shares are trading at 1.12x their normal volume.

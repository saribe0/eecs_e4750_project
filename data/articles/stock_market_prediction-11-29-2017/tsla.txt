A week after its unveiling, Tesla (TSLA) finally revealed the price of its all-electric driverless semi trucks, effectively signaling what some believe is the beginning of the end for trucks operating on gas and diesel. The company announced that the 500-mile range electric semi will start at $180,000, while the 300-mile range version will be set for $150,000. There’s also a premium Founders series which the company has priced at $200,000. Production is expected to begin in 2019, for which the company is charging a base reservation price of $20,000, broken down as a $5,000 deposit and $15,000 wire transfer upon order. But as an unabashed cheerleader of Tesla’s breakthrough battery technology and a shareholder, I question how effective this pricing strategy will be, especially given the struggles the company has already experienced with producing the Model 3? I believe Tesla is undercutting its own battery technology breakthrough. As it stands, six major transportation companies have announced plans to be among the first try out the new big rig, according to Transport Topics News. Among those, retail giant Wal-Mart (WMT) and transportation company J.B. Hunt (JBHT) have already committed to a specific number of trucks. Wal-Mart, which said that it wants to learn how the trucks will fit into its supply chain, told CNBC that fifteen trucks were being ordered, five for its U.S.-based operation and ten for Canada. The company also said that it wants to lean how the trucks “could help us meet some of our long-term sustainability goals, such as lowering emissions.” Meanwhile, J.B. Hunt CEO John Roberts, who plans to purchase several trucks, said that “Tesla trucks marks an important step in our efforts to implement industry-changing technology.” Loblaw, Canada's food and pharmacy leader, plans to order 25 trucks for its Canada operations. Meijer, a family-owned grocery chain, said it plans to tests the trucks before making a decision to purchase. The demand is apparent. And while the all-electric semi might seem pricey when compared to the a typical diesel truck that starts around $120,000, I believe Tesla can and should charge more for the trucks, given their exceptional cost-saving features when compared to their gas and diesel competitors. Tesla said the new trucks will operate at a savings of 25 cents per mile over a comparable diesel truck. While calling it “economic suicide” to continue using diesel trucks, CEO Elon Musk last week pointed out that the trucks will cost companies 20% less per mile to operate. “You’re earning 50% more per mile than in a diesel truck,” he said. This means assuming companies opt for the $150K 300-mile range model, companies can easily recoup the extra $30K in up-front costs of the 500-mile range electric semi within the first couple of years, assuming 25-cents per mile savings is accurate. As such, Tesla, which has been criticized for its high rate of cash burn, might be leaving some money on the table — money that it can use to benefit production of the Model 3 car, which is ultimately the key to its success.

Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) is an interesting player in the Consumer Goods space, with a focus on Auto Manufacturers – Major. The stock has been active on the tape, currently trading at $316.81, up from yesterday’s close by 0.40%. Given the stock’s recent action, it seemed like a good time to take a closer look at the company’s recent data. Fundamental Analysis No amount of research is complete without a bird’s eye view of the financial data. Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) currently trades with a market capitalization of $52.75 Billion. That value represents a market adjusting for revenues that have been growing by 29.86 % on a quarterly year/year basis as of the company’s last quarterly report.

For TSLA, the company currently has $3.67 Billion of cash on the books, which is offset by $441.72 Million current liabilities. You can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $-4.88 Billion over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to grow in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $-3.07 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 58.99% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors. Technical Analysis As most professionals know, technical analysis can offer critical insights into what smart money and insiders think about a stock’s prospects going forward. Looking at the stock’s movement on the chart, Tesla, Inc. recorded a 52-week high of $389.61. It is now trading 72.8% off that level. The stock is trading $334.53 its 50-day moving average by 17.72%. The stock carved out a 52-week low down at $180.00. In recent action, Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) has made a move of -1.27% over the past month, which has come on Strong relative transaction volume. Over the trailing year, the stock is underperforming the S&P 500 by 18.2, and it’s gotten there by action that has been less volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. In terms of the mechanics underlying that movement, traders will want to note that the stock is trading on a float of 22.41% with $125.33 Million sitting short, betting on future declines. That suggests something of the likelihood of a short squeeze in shares of TSLA.

The construction was completed within 55 days from Sep 29, when the grid connection deal was signed.  makeArticleAd();  In July, the company won a bid to construct 129 megawatt hour battery for Australia's most wind-energy dependent state i.e. South Australia. The company's CEO Elon Musk had pledged to install the battery within 100 days of signing the grid connection agreement. Otherwise the same would be given to the state for free.    At the time of signing the deal, Tesla had already installed half the battery packs.  Tesla Inc. Price and Consensus       Tesla Inc. Price and Consensus    |      Tesla Inc. Quote    Tesla Inc. Price and Consensus    |      Tesla Inc. Quote  The company's powerpacks have been installed at a wind farm in France's Neoen and are undergoing testing to offer grid security services. Per South Australia Energy Minister, the battery will be operational from Dec 1.    Of the total $390-million plan the state has sanctioned for diesel-fired generators to deal with frequent power cuts, it is yet to determine the amount to be paid to Tesla for the battery.    The country's energy sector already notified that the power supply will be tight, mainly in South Australia and the neighboring state of Victoria, as one of the biggest coal power plants was shut down in March.    Demand for lithium-ion batteries is expected to rise in the near future and the batteries are anticipated to be widely used in consumer electronic products as well as in electric cars to curb pollution.   Price Performance    In the last three months, shares of the company have underperformed the industry  it belongs to. The stock has lost 8.7% against the industry's 7.7% gain during the period.     Zacks Rank & Key Picks    Tesla carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).    Better-ranked stocks in the auto space include Cummins Inc. CMI  , BMW AG BAMXF  and BorgWarner Inc. BWA  . While Cummins sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), BMW and BorgWarner carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks   here   .    Cummins has an expected long-term growth rate of 12.2%. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings per share being revised 2.4% upward over the last 30 days.    BMW has an expected long-term growth rate of 4.2%. Over a year, shares of the company have been up 18.8%.    BorgWarner has an expected long-term growth rate of 9.1%. Its shares have been up 29.1% in the last six months.   Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?    Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.    With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.    It's not the one you think.

Recharging Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) new electric semi truck will need the same energy required to power as many as 4,000 homes, Financial Times reports, citing a study from Aurora Energy Research, one of Europe's leading energy consultancies. Aurora CEO John Feddersen says his firm estimates the power required for the megacharger to fill a battery in TSLA's new electric semi truck in as little as 30 minutes would total 1,600 KW, or the equivalent to providing 3K-4K "average" homes with energy - 10x as powerful as TSLA’s current network of “superchargers” for its electric cars. “The fastest chargers today can support up to around 450 KW charging, so it’s not clear yet how Tesla will achieve their desired charging speeds,” according to Colin McKerracher, head of advanced transport at Bloomberg New Energy Finance.

 @FredericLambert Tesla’s stock (TSLA) fell back roughly 20 percentage points since hitting a new all-time high in September. Despite a series of major news about the company over the last few weeks, the stock has mostly been trading sideways as analysts and the market don’t seem to have a good grasp on the situation.

(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, one of the most popular analysts following Tesla, even released a note today predicting a roller-coaster ride for investors next year: “We expect Tesla shares to be extremely volatile in 2018, divided into two stages: (1) The alleviation of production bottlenecks with strong cash inflow, and (2) mounting concerns over the sustainability of the competitive moat. Tesla 2018: $400 then $200?” Basically saying that it could go either way, which is generally seen as a cop-out for analysts. In the short-term, Tesla’s success is still highly dependent on the Model 3 production ramp up. They invested billions at the Fremont factory and Gigafactory 1 in Nevada for the vehicle program. In order to start seeing returns on those investments, they need to start delivering the vehicle in volume. We have recently seen increasing evidence of continued deliveries from Tesla over the last few weeks, but nothing that would suggest a significant increase in production capacity. In his note to clients today, Jonas says that he expects Tesla to fix its battery module production issues, which is apparently the biggest production bottleneck at this point, “in the coming weeks.” Some are saying that Tesla’s event last week was a distraction from the Model 3 program, which could explain why the market didn’t go crazy, as some expected, following the event even though Tesla unveiled two new product lines. Electrek’s Take I personally don’t believe that the Tesla event last week was a distraction tactic. Those vehicle programs were in the works for a long time and way before Tesla had any idea what kind of issue would arise regarding Model 3 production. They even delayed the event last month officially to “focus on Model 3 production” among other things. I think they unveiled those products because the prototypes were ready and now they want to gauge the interests for those vehicles. With $5,000 deposits for the trucks and $50,000/$250,000 deposits for the new Roadster, those reservations will mean a lot in terms of interest and if they turn out to be popular again even following the Model 3 delays, it would be a giant confidence boost for Tesla. A few companies have already confirmed truck reservations and Tesla started taking Roadster reservations at the event. Even though the specs and design were impressive for almost everyone, it can still be difficult to understand just how significant those products can become. We would expect the company to potentially start releasing some of those reservation numbers as early as by the end of the week, which could definitely paint a clearer idea of the situation. Tesla is a transportation and energy company. It sells vehicles under its 'Tesla Motors' division and stationary battery pack for home, commercial and utility-scale projects under its 'Tesla Energy' division.

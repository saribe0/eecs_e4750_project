ANCHORAGE, Alaska (KTUU) - Dimond High School’s Jahnna Hajdukovich on Monday held the ceremonial signing of her National Letter of Intent to play women's basketball at UAA. Basketball is the name of the game in the Hajdukovich family-- her father Jim Hajdukovich played for the Seawolves men’s team from 1995 to 1999. “My dad is in the hall of fame there (UAA), and has some records I'm hoping to break,” said Jahnna Monday. “That's the goal anyways, but that's not the only reason I went there.” It’s easy to see why the Dimond senior would want to join a program that is currently ranked second in the nation for NCAA Div. II women’s basketball, and just won its seventh Great Alaska Shootout title. "It's definitely intimidating, but I can't wait to jump into it,” said Hajdukovich. “I can't wait to contribute, and be a part of the program.” It’s also simple to see why UAA showed interest in Hajdukovich as well.   Her prep hoops resume includes being named to the all-state tournament team twice, and averaging 12.3 points per game at state.  The senior guard has just one thing missing from her resume: “I really want to be a state champ, that is my ultimate goal, and I think that me signing really gives me individual focus to help the team (Dimond).”

 The UAA volleyball team will enter the West Region tournament Thursday with one of the best liberos in the region.  Libero Keala Kaio-Perez landed on the All-West Region second team when the honors were announced Tuesday.  The Seawolves (19-10) will face Western Washington (25-3) for the third time this season at 1:30 p.m. AST Thursday at the West Region tournament in Riverside, California. UAA made the West Region tournament for the fifth straight season.  The seventh-seeded Seawolves are 0-2 this season against the second-seeded Vikings, who own a 18-match winning streak and are ranked No. 5 in NCAA Division II.  "We are playing a very familiar team and we know what they do each rotation," UAA coach Chris Green said at a weekly press conference. "We know what they're gonna do, we're just gonna do our best to try to stop it."  Heading into the match, Kaio-Perez, a senior from Waimanalo, Hawaii, leads the Great Northwest Athletic Conference with 0.48 aces per set and ranks second overall in digs with 5.30 per set, including four matches with 30 or more digs. She has 625 digs on the season.  Junior right side hitter Leah Swiss, an All-American last year, failed to make the All-West Region team.  Last week, Swiss and Kaio-Perez were first-team All-GNAC honorees.  After earning Great Alaska Shootout MVP honors and leading the UAA women's basketball team to a final Shootout title last week, forward Shelby Cloninger was named the GNAC's player of the week in women's basketball.  The 6-foot senior from Kamiah, Idaho, averaged 16 points and seven rebounds per game, shooting 9 of 18 from the field, 7 of 13 from three-point range and 7 of 7 from the free throw line in UAA's two wins over Division I Tulsa and Maryland-Eastern Shore.  The No. 2 Seawolves (6-0) open GNAC play against Central Washington at 5:15 p.m. Thursday at the Alaska Airlines Center.  UAA's Caroline Kurgat last week was honored as the national athlete of the year in NCAA Division II cross country after winning the Division II national title earlier this month.  The senior from Eldoret, Kenya, was undefeated this season against Division II competition and won the national championship in Indiana by nearly 20 seconds in 20 minutes, 32.3 seconds.

FAIRBANKS — The University of Alaska Fairbanks men’s and women’s Nordic ski team fell to in-state rival Alaska Anchorage in the 14th annual Nordic Cup on Sunday afternoon at Hatcher’s Pass.  UAA finished the two-day event in 4 hours, 49 minutes and 49.4 seconds, while UAF posted a total time of 4:56:10.5. On Sunday, the Seawolves’ mixed gender relay team of Marte Hakenstad-Braten, Hailey Swirbull, Tracen Knopp and Toomas Kollo won the 4x5-kilometer relay in 1:04:42.8 at the independence Mine Trails. The Nanooks’ mixed gender relay team consisting of Anna Darnell, Ann-Cathrin Uhl, Jan Cech and Arnaud Guyon took second, finishing the event in 1:04:59.5 Alaska Anchorage also finished third in 1:06:21.0, though Alaska’s second relay team, which features Anja Maijala, Hannah Dueling, Seiji Takagi and Max Donaldson, took fourth in 1:06:28.7.

ANCHORAGE, Alaska (KTUU) - Closing out their portion of a 40-year Anchorage Thanksgiving tradition, the UAA Seawolves' women's basketball team came back from a deficit in the final minute of the game Thursday to win the women's championship of the final Great Alaska Shootout. A last-minute layup set the Seawolves' 59-53 win over Tulsa. The Seawolves tipped off against the Tulsa Golden Hurricane Thursday afternoon, after defeating Maryland Eastern Shore on Tuesday. [40 Years of the Great Alaska Shootout] 

https://www.adn.com/sports/uaa-athletics/2017/11/22/at-the-shootout-the-game-within-the-game-keeps-fans-dancing-dabbing-and-drumming/

 In his four years in Anchorage, Travis Fuller has learned something interesting about the people who live here.  Hockey fans like rock 'n' roll.  Basketball and volleyball fans go for hip-hop.  As UAA's Fan Experience & Community Relations Engagement Manager, Fuller's job is to know such things.  He's the man who keeps things interesting during breaks in the action when UAA is playing at the Alaska Airlines Center and Sullivan Arena.  He's the man who decides if it's time for the dance cam, the Lion King cam, the bongo cam, the air guitar cam or any of the other high-energy interludes that get fans out of their seats when there's a break in the action.  Most university and pro teams have someone like Fuller running the show inside the show. As part of his requirements for a masters degree in sports administration from Canisius College, Fuller worked with the Atlanta Hawks, where he was part of a staff of 70 charged with game operations.  "That's when I learned to write the scripts," he said.  For every UAA game — and this week, for each of the 16 Shootout games — Fuller puts together a script that details everything from when to start playing warmup music and when the announcer should tell fans about the Shootout's Snapchat filter to when the players are introduced. And that's just in the 24 minutes before tipoff (which is also in the script).  For Wednesday's 8 p.m. men's game between UAA and Cal State-Riverside, Fuller followed an 11-page script. It chronicled every announcement and promotion that occurred during the game, beginning with the playing of UAA's school song when the Seawolves took the court and ending with the announcer saying, "Please drive home safely" at the end of the game.  The script is a grid that, for games that are at the Alaska Airlines Center, shows what should appear, and when, on the giant videoboard that hangs at midcourt and on the arena's ribbons — the multiple horizontal display screens on the courtside scoring tables and in front of the balcony rail.  Fuller, 28, wears a headset during the game so he can communicate with arena employees who sit in seats high above the court and run the video cameras.  "I'm kind of the quarterback down here on a headset the entire time communicating with the video dudes," he said.  The video dudes are the ones who aim cameras at dancing, dabbing and drumming fans and show their antics on the videoboard.  Most of those moments aren't scripted, because you never know when timeouts will happen. So for those occasions, Fuller's scripts includes a page with a "cam list" and another with "extra timeout options."  The cams are what get fans going. There are nine of them, including the Lion King cam, which plays the theme song from the movie while parents lift their babies or toddlers high above their heads, Simba-style; the dab cam, which invites people to do their best Cam Newton impersonation; and the Carlton dance cam, which entices them to mimic the geeky dance moves of the Carlton character from the Fresh Prince of Bel Air.  New this year is the kiss cam — no explanation needed. Gone is the awkward-dad cam, which asked men of a certain age to show off intentionally gawky moves, but it was borderline embarrassing.  "We didn't want to make anyone feel uncomfortable," Fuller said.  A couple of the cams have sponsors — Lithia sponsors the air guitar and flex cams, and Avis sponsors the dance cam, dab cam and disco cam.  Some of the cams, like the kiss cam, are used at numerous stadiums and arenas around the country. The dab cam is a UAA original, Fuller said, the result of a  conversation between him and the video dudes.  "We tested that out and kids loved it," he said. "We have a couple songs exclusively for the dab cam."  Knowing the demographics of a crowd is key to Fuller's job. By assessing the makeup of a crowd, he decides which music and which cams to use.  That's why  you're more likely to see the dab cam, which appeals to a younger crowd, at a volleyball match than a hockey game.  "Volleyball is by far our youngest crowd," Fuller said. "Hockey is almost always an older demographic. That's why rock 'n' roll works.  "… Basketball and volleyball is more pop and hip-hop, and hockey is more rock-and-roll and electronic dance music."  Fuller's favorite is the bongo cam. The videoboard displays a picture of bongo drums at the bottom of the screen, and the rest of the screen shows fans as they "drum" on the bongos to the beat of the music.  "It's easy to do, it gets the most people involved and it's fun to look around the arena and see people flailing their arms in the air," Fuller said.  Tim McDiffett, UAA's interim athletic director, said Fuller's job is to make sure fans have a good time so they keep coming back. The fact that many of the promotions engage young kids is no accident.  "The middle school kids and high school kids respond more than old folks like me — we're not going to stand up and dance and do those crazy things," McDiffett said.  He views the job performed by Fuller and the video dudes as an investment in UAA's future.  "Our goal more than anything is to entertain those school-age kids," McDiffett said. "We see that as the future of our university. They're our future fans — our future students and fans."

Polk ANCHORAGE, Alaska — Alaska-Anchorage outscored Tulsa 14-2 in the final 4 minutes, 10 seconds Thursday to pull out a 59-53 victory over the Golden Hurricane in the 40th annual Great Alaska Shootout at the Alaska Airlines Center. Crystal Polk led TU (3-3) with 12 points, Kendrian Elliott added 11, and Shug Dickson had 10 points and a team-best nine rebounds and four assists. Dickson and Polk were named to the all-tournament team. The Hurricane still led by one, 51-50, when Dickson scored but was called for an offensive foul. Coach Matilda Mossman said that was the turning point in the game. “It came down to the charge call at the 1:26 mark,” Mossman said. “We had a one-point lead, Shug (Dickson) makes a basket but is called for the foul, and Alaska-Anchorage finishes with a 9-2 run. “I am proud of the way we weathered the storm when we were down 11, but UAA played really hard and played with urgency in the end.” There were eight lead change and seven ties. Alaska-Anchorage (7-0), ranked No. 2 in NCAA Division II, was led by Hannah Wandersee with 14 points. Tulsa will return to action at 7 p.m. Wednesday against Oral Roberts in the Mayor’s Cup game at the Donald W. Reynolds Center.

ANCHORAGE, Alaska (KTUU) The final buzzer has blown on the Great Alaska Shootout, with Central Michigan taking home the men’s tournament title in a nail-biting game. Chippewas winning 75 to 72 over Bakersfield, and are the 40th and final shootout champions.  Earlier in the day, UAA head coach Rusty Osborne took part in his 81st and final shootout game. The Seawolves men falling to College of Charleston 55 to 46. Jacob Lampkin had another impressive performance for the green and gold scoring 13 points and grabbing eight rebounds. Dimond High School alumni Eric Jenkins scoring his first college points of the season on a breakaway dunk to pull UAA within in one point in the second half. But the momentum seemed to take a turn after a Kylan Osborne's technical foul. Charleston would soon pull away with a big game from Joe Chealey. After the game coach Osborne shared his final thoughts on his last shootout. "We'll look back fondly on memories, and move on to the next phase of Seawolve basketball at Thanksgiving,” Osborne said. “People will appreciate it even more when it's gone, and will understand just because Duke and Kentucky aren't here, it’s still great basketball." In the third place game, Idaho takes down Cal Poly 75-66, Victor Sanders tallying 24 points in that game.  Sam Houston State also winning over Santa Clara 73-59 for seventh place.

Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) are both Services companies that recently hit new highs. Naturally, this has caught the attention of the investment community. But which is the better investment? To answer this question, we will compare the two companies across various metrics including growth, profitability, risk, return, dividends, and valuation. Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) operates in the Discount, Variety Stores segment of the Services sector. The company has grown sales at a -0.10% annual rate over the past five years, putting it in the low growth category. TGT has a net profit margin of 3.80% and is more profitable than the average company in the Discount, Variety Stores industry. In terms of efficiency, TGT has an asset turnover ratio of 1.83. This figure represents the amount of revenue a company generates per dollar of assets. TGT’s financial leverage ratio is 2.66, which indicates that the company’s asset base is primarily funded by debt. Company’s return on equity, which is really just the product of the company’s profit margin, asset turnover, and financial leverage ratios, is 24.00%, which is better than the Discount, Variety Stores industry average ROE. Target Corporation (TGT) pays out an annual dividend of 2.48 per share. At the current valuation, this equates to a dividend yield of 4.44%. The company has a payout ratio of 50.40%. TGT’s current dividend therefore should be sustainable. Stock’s free cash flow yield, which represents the amount of cash available to investors before dividends, expressed as a percentage of the stock price, is 1.25. All else equal, companies with higher FCF yields are viewed as cheaper. Company trades at a P/E ratio of 11.72 , and is less expensive than the average stock in the Discount, Variety Stores industry. The average investment recommendation for TGT, taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts, is 3.00, or a hold. Over the past three months, Target Corporation insiders have been net sellers, acquiring a net of 5,651 shares. This implies that insiders have been feeling relatively bullish about the outlook for TGT. Insider activity and sentiment signals are important to monitor because they can shed light on how “risky” a stock is perceived to be at it’s current valuation. Knowing this, it makes sense to look at beta, a measure of market risk. TGT has a beta of 0.62 and therefore an below average level of market volatility.

The existing P/E value will allow investors to easily determine whether the company’s stock price is cheap or expensive. Corporations that acquires a higher P/E ratio are usually growth stocks.

Return on investments is normally expressed as a percentage and is used for personal financial decisions.

https://www.schaeffersresearch.com/content/options/2017/11/27/options-traders-cheer-post-black-friday-gains-from-amazon-and-wal-mart-stocks

The 20 stocks listed in the table below have attracted the highest total weekly options volume during the past 10 trading days. Stocks highlighted in yellow are new entries to the list. Data is courtesy of Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White. Two names to note coming off Black Friday are Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT), as retail stocks carry the major indexes to record highs. Below we'll break down recent options trading activity on AMZN and WMT.   During the past two weeks at the International Securities Exchange (ISE), Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), and NASDAQ OMX PHLX (PHLX), options traders have bought to open 1.17 AMZN call options for every put, putting this ratio in the high 82nd annual percentile. In other words, it would seem Amazon options traders have been more bullish than normal lately.  Digging deeper, the December 1,200 call saw one of the largest increases in open interest during this time frame among contracts yet to expire. For those who bought to open options here, the goal was for AMZN stock to rise above $1,200 before front-month options expire at the close on Friday, Dec. 15.  Well, these calls have already moved into the money, as the FAANG stock earlier topped out at a record peak of $1,213.41, and was last seen trading at $1,203.12. The shares have already risen 25% this quarter, but options traders could again be betting on more upside, since calls today are trading at two times the expected rate.  It's still a good time to target short-term Amazon options, based on its Schaeffer's Volatility Index (SVI) of 19%, which ranks in the low 22nd annual percentile. This means volatility expectations for near-term contracts are unusually low at the moment.   
Call buyers have also been active on Wal-Mart, as the security has a 10-day call/put volume ratio of 2.16 at the ISE, CBOE, and PHLX, which ranks in the 88th annual percentile. Seeing the largest increase in open interest by far during this time was the December 100 call, where nearly 29,000 positions were added. Data from the major exchanges points to mostly buy-to-open activity here, so these bulls are betting on WMT stock to top $100 in the coming weeks.  Elsewhere, the December 97.50 and January 100 calls also saw notable buy-to-open activity during this time. More near-term traders, meanwhile, targeted the weekly 12/1 97-strike call. As it stands now, call open interest on Wal-Mart ranks in the 99th percentile of its annual range.  Shares of the retailer are slightly higher today at $96.67, as they consolidate just below their Nov. 17 record high of $100.10. Year-to-date, WMT is up an impressive 40%, and even more upside could be coming, if more analysts start to come around. That is, just 10 of the 23 brokerage firms covering the retailer say it's worthy of a "buy" rating, so upgrades seem overdue.  Plus, the blue chip has an inviting SVI, like its retail rival. Specifically, its SVI of 18% ranks in just the 27th annual percentile.

Consistently, one of the more popular stocks people enter into their stock options watchlist  at Stock Options Channel is Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (Symbol: WMT). So this week we highlight one interesting put contract, and one interesting call contract, from the January 2019 expiration for WMT. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting, is at the $82.50 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $3.15. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 3.8% return against the $82.50 commitment, or a 3.3% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost  ).      Selling a put does not give an investor access to WMT's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. So unless Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. sees its shares decline 14.8% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $79.35 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $3.15 from $82.50), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 3.3% annualized rate of return.  makeArticleAd();  Worth considering, is that the annualized 3.3% figure actually exceeds the 2.1% annualized dividend paid by Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. by 1.2%, based on the current share price of $96.66. And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to fall 14.85% to reach the $82.50 strike price.    Always important when discussing dividends is the fact that, in general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., looking at the dividend history chart for WMT below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 2.1% annualized dividend yield.    Turning to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the January 2019 expiration, for shareholders of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (Symbol: WMT) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 2.1% annualized dividend yield. Selling the covered call at the $110 strike and collecting the premium based on the $3.30 bid, annualizes to an additional 3% rate of return against the current stock price (this is what we at Stock Options Channel refer to as the YieldBoost  ), for a total of 5.1% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $110 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but WMT shares would have to advance 13.5% from current levels for that to occur, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 16.9% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.    The chart below shows the trailing twelve month trading history for Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., highlighting in green where the $82.50 strike is located relative to that history, and highlighting the $110 strike in red:       The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2019 put or call options highlighted in this article deliver a rate of return that represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (considering the last 252 trading day WMT historical stock prices  using closing values, as well as today's price of $96.66) to be 18%.    In mid-afternoon trading on Monday, the put volume among S&P 500 components was 854,085 contracts, with call volume at 1.49M, for a put:call ratio of 0.57 so far for the day. Compared to the long-term median put:call ratio of .65, that represents high call volume relative to puts; in other words, buyers are showing a preference for calls in  options trading  so far today.

Consistently, one of the more popular stocks people enter into their stock options watchlist  at Stock Options Channel is McDonald's Corp (Symbol: MCD). So this week we highlight one interesting put contract, and one interesting call contract, from the January 2019 expiration for MCD. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting, is at the $115 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $1.30. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 1.1% return against the $115 commitment, or a 1% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost  ).      Selling a put does not give an investor access to MCD's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. So unless McDonald's Corp sees its shares fall 31.6% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $113.70 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $1.30 from $115), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 1% annualized rate of return. Turning to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the January 2019 expiration, for shareholders of McDonald's Corp (Symbol: MCD) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 2.4% annualized dividend yield. Selling the covered call at the $190 strike and collecting the premium based on the $3.80 bid, annualizes to an additional 2% rate of return against the current stock price (this is what we at Stock Options Channel refer to as the YieldBoost  ), for a total of 4.4% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $190 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but MCD shares would have to advance 12.9% from current levels for that to happen, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 15.2% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.makeArticleAd();    The chart below shows the trailing twelve month trading history for McDonald's Corp, highlighting in green where the $115 strike is located relative to that history, and highlighting the $190 strike in red:       The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2019 put or call options highlighted in this article deliver a rate of return that represents good reward for the risks.

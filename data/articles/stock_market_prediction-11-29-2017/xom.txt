Most of the investors recently have been curious over the performance of Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stock. It is widely believed that a stock’s future performance can best be predicted by analyzing prior trends and patterns in price. In the case of XOM, the chart has some interesting things to say about where the stock might be headed in the future. How has the stock performed recently? Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) in the last month has decreased -2.46%. Shares are now up over the past year, outperforming the broad market by -100% and underperformed a peer group of similar companies by -118%. After the latest session, which saw the stock close at a price of $81.42, XOM sits below its 52-week high.

     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that XOM may be headed in the future. To forecast a stock’s future performance, analysts use momentum indicators, which take into account the size and speed of these price movements. As momentum begins to slow, it may be a sign that a recent trend is about to reverse. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for XOM is 46.24%, which suggests that the stock is not particularly expensive or cheap, and not predisposed to a reactive price movement based on this measure. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 28.29%, tells a different story, and suggests that XOM currently trades in oversold territory. What do the trading volumes reveal? Price isn’t the only tool analysts use to forecast future performance. Volume patterns can also reveal some important insights. If, for instance, a stock’s volumes suddenly increase by a significant amount, it’s usually a sign that the level of conviction behind the trade is high. Investors may feel very strongly about the future direction of the stock in question. Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) average trading volume of 8,850,079 during the past month is 17.42% below its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been less active than usual in the stock in recent times. What do the analysts think? XOM is currently undervalued by -3.49% relative to the average 1-year price target of $84.36 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 2.90, which implies that analysts are generally neutral in their outlook for XOM over the next year. How risky is the stock?  Absolute price performance isn’t the only thing analysts consider when predicting future performance: volatility matters as well. Beta, which measures the stock’s volatility relative to the overall market, is a simple but effective metric for assessing risk. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has a beta of 0.82, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are less extreme than the market as a whole. XOM therefore has a below average level of market risk. During the past couple of weeks, XOM average daily volatility was 10.03%, which is -0.71 percentage points higher than the average volatility over the past 100 days.

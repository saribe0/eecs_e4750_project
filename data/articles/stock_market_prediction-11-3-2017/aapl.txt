 @benlovejoy Following strong fiscal Q4 earnings and guidance for a record-breaking holiday quarter, AAPL shares have hit an all-time record high of $173.25 in pre-market trading (at the time of writing), up 3% on yesterday’s close of $168.11. The current share price values the company at around $900B, taking it a significant step closer to becoming the first ever trillion-dollar company …

NordVPN The graph shows a temporary sharp drop when the price hit $174, possibly caused by automatic sales programmed for profit-taking at that price. The stock quickly rebounded. Apple’s Q4 (calendar Q3) earnings exceeded analyst expectations, suggesting that the iPhone 8 has proven more popular than expected despite those waiting for the iPhone X, and the company gave extremely strong guidance for the holiday quarter, predicting record-breaking sales. The good news didn’t end with iPhones, sales of Macs, iPads, other products and services all showing substantial growth. Investors may also be encouraged by Republican tax proposals which would make it cheaper for Apple to repatriate its overseas cash. Apple has forecast sales in the $84-87B range, against analyst expectations of $85B. This suggests confidence in both demand for the iPhone X, and ability to boost supplies. Given that Tim Cook was unable to say when supply might balance demand, it also points to a likely strong follow-up quarter in the new year. The Street reports that ripple effects from Apple’s results could contribute to the Dow hitting a record high. Check out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:  Breaking news from Cupertino.

AAPL



 released fiscal fourth-quarter earnings after the market closed Thursday, a dayÂ before actual sales of the new iPhone X begins.Â An earnings beat and forecast for record revenue in the holiday shopping quarter sent Apple shares to record levels in late trading and toward a $900 billion market cap.Â MarketWatch tech editor Jeremy C. Owens (@jowens510) and reporter Max A. Cherney (@chernandburn) live-blogged the release of the results and subsequent conference call with executives. See also:

Apple stock hits records after iPhone X reviews say its a glimpse of the future
Apple’s Tim Cook warns of divisive effect of fake news, pushes for tax reform Welcome to our Apple earnings live blog, everyone! Apple usually doesn’t post results till about 1:30 Pacific time, so we have some time to talk expectations and other interesting stuff. iPhone X really is the star of this report, even though sales don’t begin until tomorrow. Apple began selling iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus late in the fiscal fourth quarter, but most analysts think those sales will not be huge because Apple’s diehard fansÂ were waiting for the iPhone X, the 10th anniversary smartphone that starts at $1,000. The danger of that is that Apple could end its fiscal year with little or no revenue and iPhone sales growth for a second straight year, afterÂ sales declined in the 2016 fiscal year for the first time since the iPhone was introduced. I broke down this and other issues in a full preview that you can read here. Analysts on average think Apple will report $50.69 billion in revenue for the quarter, which would mean a $12 billion gain overall for the fiscal year. While $12 billion is a big number, Appleâs revenue total is so large that it would be about a 5.5% gain. Apple’s forecast called for sales of $49 billion to $52 billion, so analysts’ average is right at the midpoint of that guidance. Analysts on Estimize, which crowdsources from a variety of places, think the total will be higher. Average there is at $51.44 billion. Apple stock closed up about 0.7% at $168.11. That’s the second highest closing price in Apple history (adjusted forÂ splits and such), after the company hit a record close of $169.04 on Halloween. That makes Apple’s leading market cap $868.9 billion, according to FactSet; by my math, Apple would need to add about 3.6% to get to a $900 billion market cap for the first time. Beyond iPhones, I’m interested to see how Macs and iPads did in the back-to-school-shopping quarter. Apple has made a big push for the education market after Chromebooks managed to find a lot of customers there, so it will be interesting to see if that paid off in more sales. Last quarter, iPads enjoyed a surprising boost in sales, but early third-party analyses said Macs wereÂ not huge gainers in back-to-school shopping.Â  Expectations for iPad and Mac sales:iPad: 10 million units for $4.36 billionMac: 5 million units for $6.23 billion Analysts expectÂ Apple sold 46 million iPhones for a total of $29.8 billion in the quarter, so you get a sense of why the iPhone is the most important product in Apple’s lineup. Apple’s second largest segment behind iPhone is actually software and services, which includes Apple Music and other Apple offerings as well as the cut Apple takes from apps and subscription purchased through the App Store. Analysts expect that segment brought in $7.56 billion – it has racked up revenue of $7B+ in the first three quarters of the year. The most important number Apple will share today for investors is the forecast for the fiscal first quarter. Analysts currently expect Apple to record revenue of $85.8 billion in the holiday shopping quarter, which would easily be a record – Apple has never had as much as $80 billion in quarterly revenue before. If Apple comes in around that number, the presumption is that it believes it can satisfy demand for the iPhone X, which was already seeing delivery delays of more than a month when preorders began last week. if the forecast is appreciably lower, it will be taken as a sign that Apple will still be working to get the iPhone X to consumers whenÂ 2017 comes to a close. While a short forecast could affect Apple stock in the short term, it’s doubtful that it will be a long-term issue because analysts and investors believe that Apple will eventually sell enough $1,000-plus smartphones to make TONS of money. The only question is if it will be mostly in the current quarter or more spread out. We’re about 5 minutes away from the report. If you have any questions or anything you would like to see us address, please comment at the bottom of the page and we will attempt to address. Plenty of earnings reports have already dropped this afternoon – Starbucks is down 5% after a revenue miss, and the coffee company is selling its Tazo tea brand to Unilever. Pandora and Activision are also falling after earnings. The key financial numbers we’re looking for, and analyst estimates:Net income: $9.72 billion, or $1.87 a share.Revenue: $50.69 billion As always, I’ll be looking at cash on hand and reminding everyone freaking out about it being more than a quarter of a trillion dollars that it is only that high because Apple keeps wracking up debt to avoid baying taxes on overseas profit. We have the numbers Apple up 2% Forecast: $84B-$87B – that’s good. Sales beat expectations at $52.6 billion, aboveÂ the forecast range. Net income of $10.71 billion blows away expectations.Â  Shares now up 2.8%, getting close to that magical number that would mean a $900 billion market cap. Unit sales: 46.7M iPhones10.3M iPads5.4M Macs All of those are just a bit better than expected, but add up to that big beat. Software and services is $8.5 billion, a big beat and I believe a record. So these would be record prices for Apple stock if they stick around into tomorrow morning’s trading session. Gains are now at 3.2%, getting closer … Tim Cook’s statement about earnings: We’re happy to report a very strong finish to a great fiscal 2017, with record fourth quarter revenue, year-over-year growth for all our product categories, and our best quarter ever for Services.Â With fantastic new products including iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, Apple Watch Series 3, and Apple TV 4K joining our product lineup, we’re looking forward to a great holiday season, and with the launch of iPhone X getting underway right now, we couldn’t be more excited as we begin to deliver our vision for the future with this stunning deviceÂ  Here is Apple’s full forecast: That is strong. Getting reaaaaaaaal close to $900 billion – stock up 3.5% Apple has cash on hand of $268.9 billion. Again, that is the number you will see all over the place, butÂ Apple sold more debt in the quarter and now has $97.2 billion in long-term debt. Their net cash position is more like $170 billion. Nothing to sneeze at, but not $268.9 billion. Cook gave an interview to The Wall Street Journal ahead of the release, and addressed reports of production issues with iPhone X: âThe ramp, especially considering how advanced the product is, is going well,â Cook said in an interview. âObviously, if it wasnât, we wouldnât be able to guideâ for record revenue for the current quarter. One of the most important beats in this earnings report full of them involves China – the company recorded sales of $9.8 billion in Greater China, beating expectations of $8.97 billion. Apple has struggled for growth in China, but that total is up both sequentially and year-over-year. Apple sales grew in all geographies both sequentially and year-over-year except in Japan, which declined from the same quarter a year ago. All product categories gained year-over-year and sequentially except for iPad, which fell 10% in unit sales and 3% in revenue from that big surprise in the third quarter. The stronger performance in revenue than units probably means a mix that trended toward the iPad Pro, which has a higher price. Macs did really well in the back to school quarter, with revenue up 25% year-over-year and unit sales up 10%. That’s really big after the same quarter a year ago was rather disappointing for Mac sales. Biggest growth for Apple continues to be in Software and Services, which was up 34% from a year ago, and “Other products,” which includes the Apple Watch, accessories like Beats headphones and iPods. That category gained 36% year over year, which could have been fueled by the new Apple Watch Series 3, which allows for a cellular connection without a nearby tethered iPhone.Â  Apple does not break out Apple Watch sales individually, so we will have to wait for the conference call to get any information executives choose to share about the launch of the new smartwatch. Apple stock seems to have settled at gains around 3.2% – not enough for a $900 billion market cap, but plenty for record high prices. ex-share based compensation to Apple employees, the company’s operating expenses are: - research and development: $2.42 billion (stock to employees developing new products, etc.) - selling, general and administrative: $3.42 billion (this would include CEO Tim Cook’s stock options, and likely other top executives) - cost of sales: $32.4 billion For reference on my point about Mac sales – last year in the back to school quarter, Mac unit sales declined 14%Â and Mac revenue dropped 17%. so strong gains are a definite relief for Apple and shows it has made some gains in the education market. Without the help of the $1,000 iPhone X, the average sales price for iPhones in Q4 was $618 Less than 5 minutes away from the call, I’m dialing in and choking down a shwarma wrap for the energy I need to snark … Average sales price for iPads was $468, and for Mac it was $1331 OK, Max and I have dialed in and we’re ready to hear from CEO Tim Cook and CFO Luca Maestri We are beginning. Apple got another bump as call started, up 3.5%. Soooo close to $900 billion. Cook running down the numbers at the moment. Revenue doubled in India year over year Cook now breaking down revenue by country, which can be seen in the financials here. Oops, I may not have mentioned the earnings per share – it was $2.07, 20 cents above expectations. Cook says iPhone 8 is the most popular new iPhone to date. And now he’s talking up the new features in the iPhone X. “Orders have already been very strong,” Cook said. Cook calls iPhone X orders “very strong” after spending a couple minutes basically advertising for it. Apple was pretty silent on iPads for a while, but now that sales are rising again, Cook is talking about them again. Notes second straight quarter of double-digit percentage gains in unit sales year over year Cook says iOS is the largest OS for augmented reality in the world. “AR is going to change the way we will use technology forever,” Cook says. Cook now discussing more iOS 11 features for developers and others. Mac had its best year ever, Cook says. Best quarter ever due to new notebooks launched in June and a robust back to school season, he says. There is one factoid on Apple Watch sales: “Unit growth of over 50% for the third consecutive quarter.” That growth was despite Apple Watch Series 3 only providing six weeks of sales. Now Cook is talking about all the new features in the Series 3 watch, no financial information or sales numbers. Cook Mentions new Apple TV, but gives no sales info. Apple TV is also in the “Other products” bucket of revenue. Cook says wearables revenue is that of a fortune 400 company. Does not give a number. Â  Â  Cook says holiday quarter expected to be the largest ever. GBH Insights’ Daniel Ives checks in with this analysis of the quarter: this SeptemberÂ quarter is the popcorn for the real feature movie in Cupertino which is watching theÂ iPhone X super cycle product release take hold over the next year and potentiallyÂ helping AAPL shares reach the elusive trillion dollar market cap club. CFO Luca Maestri now reading the numbers in detail. Also got a quick reax note from RBC’s Amit Daryanani: We think the better revenue guide coupled with comments that they dont know when supply/demand for iPhone X will be in balance and relatively better gross-margin guide should be incrementally positive for AAPL. Overall,Â strong sales print/guide, better gross margins and higher China revenue performance should positively impact AAPL sentiment. Maestri says app store generates twice the revenue of Alphabet’s Google Play store. Â  Â  On Ives’ call for a trillion-dollar market cap – Apple shares will have to hit $193.60 at its currentÂ share count to hit that number. Shares are currently selling at around $173 in after hours action; they will have to hit $174.24 for $900 billion. Maestri says iCloud growth saw double digit growth.Â  Maestri running through the Mac sales, says that Macbook Pro revenue drove the growth in sales. Analysis from Moor Insights and Strategy’s Patrick Moorhead: “Apple crushed it in Q4 and provided signals they could meet most of the demand next quarter for iPhone X. The biggest standouts for me were that every single product and service line was up, including iPads, which had been challenged.” Maestri says iPad sales grew across the world, specifically calls outÂ 24% growth in China, and 39% growth in India. SoÂ that iPad boost appears to be coming from Asia. Interesting. Mizuho analyst Abhey Lamba: “While we are encouraged by accelerating growth in the services business, we note that at about 10-12% of total revenue, the segment remains too small to move the needle for Apple.” Random fact about Apple stock: it will have taken at least 9,305 trading days for Apple to reach a $900 billion market cap if Apple closes above $174.23. $104 billion in term debt – that’s more than is on the balance sheet, so $7 billion in debt that Apple issued must have come too late to make it on there.Â  Maestri says $166 billion in share repurchases. that makes net cash position closer to $165 billion – again, this is the more accurate number for Apple’s cash position than the $268.9 billion number most commonly cited. 94% of Apple’s cash is overseas, Maestri disclosed. Would like to know how much of that is invested in U.S. debt … analyst: asks when you expect with iPhone demand — probably not going to be in Dec., will it be in March? Cook says ramp for iPhone X is going well — “happy to increase week by week” and we’re going to get as many of them as possible to customers as soon as possible. Can’t predict when balance will happen.” No guidance beyond current quarter. So Cook didn’t really answer question about how long the production ramp would be, said he couldn’t really know right now, which is probably an honest answer. Cook now talking about Q4 in China. Increased market share for iPhone, Mac, and iPad.Â Hit all time revenue records for services; very strong iPad revenue growth. Double digit unit growth in iPhone. Both upgraders and Android switchers were up on a year-over-year basis, Cook says. Decline experience in Hong Kong has moderated. Apple has been blaming Hong Kong for its difficulties in China, now says that decline has moderated a bit and is reaching easier year-ago comparisons. analyst: asking about iPhone X pre-orders vs. iPhone 8 pre-orders. Cook says we never go through mix. iPhone X orders are strong for direct customers and channel partners, such as carriers around the world. As of a few minutes ago the first sales started in Australia. We had several hundred people waiting in store in Sydney. If Apple actually manages to reinvigorate the launch-day iPhone parties that had been evaporating the last couple years, that’s some valuable free marketing. Cook giving his philosophy on augmented reality. He thinks it should be a help for humanity, not an isolation thing. Cook says augmented reality features/tech is coming in from all over the place, many, many different applications and uses across industries. Cook says that Apple is the only company that could have brought this because it requires hardware and software integration. Cook has made a big bet on augmented reality â he stayed away from virtual reality and openly said he though AR was going to be bigger, and the iPhone X is the first device really geared toward AR. That could end up being a big legacy for him, if heâs right (I think he is). analyst: asking Cook about the iPhone lineup… how is he thinking about what went into the Dec. quarter guidance? Strong demand at low end or benefit from iPhone X? In Q4, Cook says had good success through range of iPhones. Tried to have an “affordable” iPhone for people with a “limited budget” and have some expensive phones — the three new iPhones. Cook pointing out that its the first time the company has three top phones, and a staggered launch — “we’re going to see what happens. We’re bullish.” Cook is basically talking around the belief that iPhone 7Â may have sold better than the new iPhone 8s – ASPs were down a tick despite a higher price tag for iPhone 8 than previous new versions, which suggests consumers were going for the cheaper iPhone 7 instead.Â Third-party analyses also claimed that iPhone 7 was more popular than iPhone 8 and 8 Plus since launch. Maestri now answering a question about Services revenue. He says growing at 24%, and there was a one time charge in the quarter. Apple Music subscriptions up 75% year over year. analyst: please comment on the iPhone sales mix — which phones are selling more, basically. Cook says not talking about it. Says the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus became the top two selling products “instantly.” The Plus got off to the fastest start of any Plus model. Execs were surprised, a positive surprise, Cook says. That was a definitive Cook answer on the question about 7 vs. 8. Those statements, along with the revenue and iPhone unit sales beat, should put to rest concerns about iPhone 8 sales. Cook says, in terms of price elasticity, a large number of people pay by the phone every month. Says you can buy an iPhone X for $33 a month; that’s less than a coffee a day, “at one of these nice coffee places.” Cook also says that it’s important to understand pricing in terms of how people actually buy the phone. “We price in terms of the value we are pricing.” Also says they’re not charging the highest price they can. Says some stuff about how amazing it is. Cookâs comments were in response to a question about why Apple charged $1,000 for the iPhone X, a level no other popular phone had ever breached. Cook says he views AR as profound… not today, but in the future, in terms of what it can be, after asked about the company’s leadership in that area. Apple typically does not “lead” with new tech, not first to market. analyst: why should/shouldn’t we expect gross margins to improve this cycle vs. previous ones? Maestri taking the question: cost structure of new products tend to be higher than previous ones, b/c of new tech, etc. Says Apple has a good track record of bringing those costs down over the life of a product. analyst asking about first 24 hour orders, and when Apple expects to reach supply/demand balance. Basically want to know about early orders and supply. Cook says the truth is they don’t know. “Best estimate is in the guidance. We’re really bullish, and feel really great about the product lineup.” Says they just sold the first units a few minutes ago. And says that until all the phones are out there any iPhone mix discussion isn’t fruitful. Says again that the company has never done this before. Again, Cook says Apple has no idea when it can catch up with demand on the iPhone X. Again, that seems like an honest answer – demand is unknowable for certain, and supply is a work in progress. Analyst now asking how the company could be more successful in India? A second question about sales mix. Cook says growing a market in India is like the many years that the company has put into China; building stores, marketing, channel partners, the right product lineup. Cook says the company is making good progress in India, but still has a long way to go. Sees it about an opportunity vs. a problem. Cook says last quarter majority of iPhone SEs sold in India last quarter were made in India. So Apple is manufacturing iPhone SEs in India and selling a good bit there. When it launched, I assumed the iPhone SE was more aimed at children (a replacement for the iPod Touch), but makes sense for emerging markets as well. On monetizing augmented reality/virtual reality Cook says customer experience is first, and revenues and profits will come from that. “We’re very much focused on experience right now.” A question about Services and why it’s growing so fast from an analyst. Maestri says that customer behavior is one factor, people spend more money over time. Also that there are some changes to the App Store and people spend more time and download more apps. Points out Music and iCloud are growing rapidly as well. analyst asking about iPhone 8 and 8 Plus in mainland China, and pre-orders of iPhone X. Cook says (again) that he won’t disclose product mix. analyst asking about iPhone 8 and 8 Plus in mainland China, and pre-orders of iPhone X. Cook says (again) that he won’t disclose product mix. This entire call has been analysts coming up with different ways of asking “How many preorders for iPhone X did you get and how many iPhone 8/8 Plus phones did you sell,” and Cook continuously saying “We don’t disclose sales mix.” analyst asks about growth quarer-by-quuarter, Cook says that emerging market growth was very strong, calls out basically every product and says it’s been a good quarter. “This is going to be the best holiday season yet.” Looks like that’s it. Analyst got cut off asking a follow up. Thanks for reading everyone! CFRA analyst Angelo Zino: “We are optimistic about iPhone prospects over the next year and believe concerns about supply constraints were likely overdone.” And that’s a wrap! Apple stock fell back a bit during the call, but is still up about 2% at $171.40, which would be a record price in regular trading. Thanks for joining us, everyone, check back with MarketWatch later this evening and tomorrow morning for more on Apple earnings.

One day before Apple once again welcomes long lines for the latest iPhone at its stores across the world, the company recorded yet another massive quarter, even without any new phones making a difference on its bottom line. Apple announced its fourth-quarter earnings on Nov. 2—its fiscal year ends in September—and they crushed Wall Street’s estimates. Analysts had expected the company to generate $50.7 billion in revenue, but it actually posted $52.58 billion, up 12% from the same quarter last year. Profits were up 19% to $10.7 billion in the fourth quarter. The company’s stock spiked in after-hours trading, both on the strong quarter and Apple’s guidance for next quarter, which will include the holiday season and its release of new iPhones. The company said in a release that it expects to generate between $84 billion and $87 billion next quarter; even the low end of that projection would be a 7% increase over Apple’s record-breaking first quarter last year. At the time of publishing, Apple’s stock price was $174.30, up about 3% from when the market closed. After a mixed 2016, which saw Apple post its first profit and revenue declines in over a decade, it seems the company is on the upswing again. The new iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, as well as the Apple Watch Series 3, were released about a week before the end of the fourth quarter. But Apple saw strong sales of iPhones—which still account for over 50% of its total revenue—even with new versions on the horizon. The company sold 46.6 million iPhones this quarter, up more than 1 million from the number it sold in the same quarter last year. The iPhone X, Apple’s $1,000-and-up new flagship device, hits stores Nov. 3. That likely accounts for part of Apple’s strong first-quarter guidance—even if the company sells the same number of iPhones as it did in the first quarter of 2017, it’ll likely rake in far more cash. The average sale price of an iPhone is currently about $618; it’ll be worth keeping an eye on just how much that figure spikes when Apple reports the first tranche of iPhone X sales. Of course, Apple’s success extends far beyond its smartphones. The company’s services business, which includes sales of apps, games, music, AppleCare, and subscriptions to iCloud and Apple Music, generated $8.5 billion in the fourth quarter, up about 34%. Over the fiscal year, Services has generated just shy of $30 billion for Apple, making it the size of a Fortune 100 company in its own right. Even when Apple doesn’t have new devices to lure customers, services offerings still seem to keep them inside its walled garden. This was also a strong quarter for Apple’s computer business. The company unveiled new MacBook Pro laptops and iMac desktops earlier this year, and they appear to have been the devices of choice for students this fall. Apple CEO Tim Cook said this quarter was the strongest quarter ever for the Mac, which generated $7.17 billion in revenue, a 25% increase over the same quarter last year. The new iPad Pro released over the summer, which Apple has tried to market as a computer perfect for students, does not seem to have resonated quite as strongly with consumers. It generated $4.83 billion in the back-to-school quarter, which is an increase of 13% over the same quarter last year but a sequential drop from the $4.97 billion it generated last quarter, when the device was released. Cook said that the Apple Watch had “unit growth of over 50%” for the third consecutive quarter, but the company still refuses to break out how many watches it has sold. Instead, watch sales are lumped into Apple’s “Other Products” bucket, which also includes Beats headphones, iPods, other accessories, and its AirPods wireless headphones (which may also be contributing to the uptick in sales for this bucket). Other Products generated $3.23 billion for the fourth quarter, up 36% over last year. Apple also saw positive gains in two markets that it has set its sights on for future growth. Chief financial officer Luca Maestri said that the company’s revenues in China were up 12% year-over-year, to $9.8 billion. Revenue also doubled, to $2.81 billion, in India, which is included in Apple’s “Rest of Asia” bucket. Apple now has nearly $269 billion in cash on hand. But it’s still not clear what it plans to do with that all cash (other than petition to bring it back to the US, or possibly build a car), if anything.

Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) unveiled its latest quarterly earnings results after hours today. The company continued the streak of tech companies beating expectations as it sold 46.7 million units in iPhone sales during its fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, topping the 46 million that analysts polled by FactSet had projected. The company’s revenue totals also impressed as Apple brought in $52.6 billion, compared to analysts’ expectations of $50.7 billion, according to data compiled by Thomson Reuters. A year ago, the tech company posted sales of $46.9 billion. In its first quarter, Apple sees its revenue as being in the range of $84 billion to $87 billion compared to the Thomson Reuters estimate of $84.9 billion. The launch of the new iPhone has been a hit for the company as the release of both the iPhone and the iPhone 8 Plus saw both phones become the highest-selling phones at the moment for Apple. It’s no secret that the tech giant has been investing heavily in China recently, where sales tallied up to $9.8 billion, a 12% increase compared to the year-ago mark. Sales of iPads were particularly good in Asia as the tablets’ sales grew 39% year-over-year in India. AAPL stock gained 1.8% after the bell Thursday.

 @benlovejoy Following strong fiscal Q4 earnings and guidance for a record-breaking holiday quarter, AAPL shares have hit an all-time record high of $173.25 in pre-market trading (at the time of writing), up 3% on yesterday’s close of $168.11. The current share price values the company at around $900B, taking it a significant step closer to becoming the first ever trillion-dollar company … 

(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
NordVPN The graph shows a temporary sharp drop when the price hit $174, possibly caused by automatic sales programmed for profit-taking at that price. The stock quickly rebounded. Apple’s Q4 (calendar Q3) earnings exceeded analyst expectations, suggesting that the iPhone 8 has proven more popular than expected despite those waiting for the iPhone X, and the company gave extremely strong guidance for the holiday quarter, predicting record-breaking sales. The good news didn’t end with iPhones, sales of Macs, iPads, other products and services all showing substantial growth. Investors may also be encouraged by Republican tax proposals which would make it cheaper for Apple to repatriate its overseas cash. Apple has forecast sales in the $84-87B range, against analyst expectations of $85B. This suggests confidence in both demand for the iPhone X, and ability to boost supplies. Given that Tim Cook was unable to say when supply might balance demand, it also points to a likely strong follow-up quarter in the new year. The Street reports that ripple effects from Apple’s results could contribute to the Dow hitting a record high. Check out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:  Breaking news from Cupertino.

 @benlovejoy After-hours trading in AAPL stock already values the company at $900B, but target prices from almost half the analyst reports seen following yesterday’s bumper earnings report and record-breaking guidance would value the company at more than a trillion dollars …

NordVPN Business Insider had a roundup of 15 analyst ratings, with seven of them setting a target price for the stock above the magic $193 which would see the company hit a market capitalization of a trillion dollars. Most rate the stock a buy/overweight, with only Barclays and Deutsche Bank instead rating it a hold. Deutsche Bank gave no particular reason for its position beyond stating that it had a ‘more conservative long-term view.’ Barclays said that big questions have been left unanswered. In our view, three big questions were not addressed: 1) Why doesn’t Apple disclose a pre-order IPX units number? 2) Are IPX wait times due to really strong demand or bigger-than-usual supply challenges? 3) Will price elasticity be in effect after the early adopters fade in coming quarters? But most analysts were optimistic, expecting the iPhone X to unlock pent-up demand for a new iPhone design, especially in China. Macquarie summarised most of the reasons given by other analysts. The bottom line is that Apple is dominating high-end smartphones and associated Services. Our bullish view of X is driven by the fact it is the most innovative iPhone in years, and that the more limited innovation of iPhone 7 still led to 215mm phone sales. Services growth, while still driven by broader app sales, also has more drivers, including Music, iCloud, Search, Apple Pay and more. Finally the new disclosure that Wearables is the size of a Fortune 400 company, and that Apple Watch sales grew over 50% 3 qtrs in row, highlights another category that is adding to overall growth.

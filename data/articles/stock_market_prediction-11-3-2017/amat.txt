 The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For AMAT, the company currently has $5.28 Billion of cash on the books. You can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $3.4 Billion over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to hold steady in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $0.91 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 81.91% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors. Technical Analysis It’s important to check the technicals to get a sense of how AMAT has been acting. Looking at the stock’s movement on the chart, Applied Materials, Inc. recorded a 52-week high of $56.82. It is now trading 1.11% off that level. The stock is trading $49.96 its 50-day moving average by -5.75%. The stock carved out a 52-week low down at $28.02. In recent action, Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT) has made a move of +7.97% over the past month, which has come on weak relative transaction volume. Over the trailing year, the stock is underperforming the S&P 500 by 23.3, and it’s gotten there by action that has been more volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. In terms of the mechanics underlying that movement, traders will want to note that the stock is trading on a float of 1.44% with $1.06 Billion sitting short, betting on future declines. That suggests something of the likelihood of a short squeeze in shares of AMAT.

After staying quite for a long time Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) shares have recently been behaving interestingly to keep investors awake. Many analysts use price trends and patterns to predict future performance, and we can glean some important insights about AMAT by examining the chart. How has the stock performed recently? Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) in the last month has increased +8.85%. Shares are now up over the past year, outperforming the broad market by -100% and outperformed a peer group of similar companies by 141%. After the latest session, which saw the stock close at a price of $56.43, AMAT sits below its 52-week high. Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) has been trading in a bullish manner, based on the relative positions of the stock’s 20 and 200 day moving averages. Momentum indicators 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that AMAT may be headed in the future. If we want to get a sense of AMAT’s future performance, we have to look at the speed and size of these price movements. Using what are known as momentum indicators, we can use the stock’s price momentum to get a sense of whether the stock is in the midst of, or nearing the end of, a current trend. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for AMAT is 69.53%, which suggests that the stock is not particularly expensive or cheap, and not predisposed to a reactive price movement based on this measure. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 92.07%, tells a different story, and suggests that AMAT currently trades in overbought territory. What do the trading volumes reveal? In addition to price, analysts use volume trends to predict future performance. The level of trading activity in a stock is often a good proxy for the level of interest and enthusiasm for the name within the investment community. A sudden increase in activity can be a sign that investors are trading in anticipation of a catalyst. Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT) average trading volume of 9,402,280 during the past month is 4.93% below its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been less active than usual in the stock in recent times. What do the analysts think? AMAT is currently undervalued by -5.79% relative to the average 1-year price target of $59.90 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 1.80, which implies that analysts are generally bullish in their outlook for AMAT over the next year. How risky is the stock?  Absolute price performance isn’t the only thing analysts consider when predicting future performance: volatility matters as well. Beta, which measures the stock’s volatility relative to the overall market, is a simple but effective metric for assessing risk. Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) has a beta of 1.83, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are more extreme than the market as a whole. AMAT therefore has a above average level of market risk. During the past couple of weeks, AMAT average daily volatility was 16.23%, which is 12.11 percentage points lower than the average volatility over the past 100 days.

https://stocknewsgazette.com/2017/10/30/dissecting-the-numbers-for-applied-materials-inc-amat-and-teradyne-inc-ter/

Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) shares are up more than 75.67% this year and recently increased 1.36% or $0.76 to settle at $56.69. Teradyne, Inc. (NYSE:TER), on the other hand, is up 68.27% year to date as of 10/27/2017. It currently trades at $42.74 and has returned 9.28% during the past week. Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) and Teradyne, Inc. (NYSE:TER) are the two most active stocks in the Semiconductor Equipment & Materials industry based on today’s trading volumes. The market is clearly enthusiastic about both these stocks, but which is the better investment? To answer this, we will compare the two companies based on the strength of their growth, profitability, risk, returns, valuation, analyst recommendations, and insider trends. Growth Companies that can consistently grow earnings at a high compound rate usually have the greatest potential to create value for shareholders in the long-run. Analysts expect AMAT to grow earnings at a 28.63% annual rate over the next 5 years. Comparatively, TER is expected to grow at a 21.80% annual rate. All else equal, AMAT’s higher growth rate would imply a greater potential for capital appreciation. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Profitability and Returns Growth isn’t very attractive to investors if companies are sacrificing profitability and shareholder returns to achieve that growth. We will use EBITDA margin and Return on Investment (ROI), which control for differences in capital structure between the two companies, to measure profitability and return., compared to an EBITDA margin of 27.58% for Teradyne, Inc. (TER). AMAT’s ROI is 17.30% while TER has a ROI of -2.20%. The interpretation is that AMAT’s business generates a higher return on investment than TER’s. Cash Flow  
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Cash is king when it comes to investing. AMAT’s free cash flow (“FCF”) per share for the trailing twelve months was +1.09. Comparatively, TER’s free cash flow per share was +1.34. On a percent-of-sales basis, AMAT’s free cash flow was 10.74% while TER converted 15.12% of its revenues into cash flow. This means that, for a given level of sales, TER is able to generate more free cash flow for investors. Liquidity and Financial Risk Balance sheet risk is one of the biggest factors to consider before investing. AMAT has a current ratio of 2.90 compared to 4.70 for TER. This means that TER can more easily cover its most immediate liabilities over the next twelve months. AMAT’s debt-to-equity ratio is 0.61 versus a D/E of 0.18 for TER. AMAT is therefore the more solvent of the two companies, and has lower financial risk. Valuation AMAT trades at a forward P/E of 15.51, a P/B of 6.96, and a P/S of 4.38, compared to a forward P/E of 19.19, a P/B of 4.15, and a P/S of 4.17 for TER. AMAT is the cheaper of the two stocks on an earnings basis but is expensive in terms of P/B and P/S ratio.

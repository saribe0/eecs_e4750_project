Amazon has never particularly cared about hitting short-term earnings expectations. But when it does, investors go crazy. Shares of Amazon surged 8% in after-hours trading today (Oct. 26) after the company beat third-quarter expectations. Amazon reported $256 million in profit, roughly comparable to net income in the same quarter a year earlier. It generated $43.7 billion in sales, up 34% year over year and comfortably above the $42 billion in revenue that analysts were expecting. The results mean that Amazon’s sales growth has now accelerated for four straight quarters, a good sign for the company as sales growth in its crucial Amazon Web Services unit has stagnated. AWS, Amazon’s cloud services business and a reliable revenue-generator, contributed $4.6 billion in revenue in the most recent quarter, up 42% from the third quarter of 2017. That’s about the same rate that AWS grew at in the second quarter of this year, and slower than any other quarter in recent years. The main event of Amazon’s third quarter was, of course, the $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods that it completed in August. Amazon said Whole Foods contributed $1.3 billion in sales this past quarter, which ended Sept. 30. Whole Foods reported $3.7 billion in sales in its quarter ended July 2, its last one as an independent public company.

Amazon earnings (Shutterstock photo) Retail giant Amazon (AMZN) is set to report third quarter fiscal 2017 earnings results after the closing bell Thursday. In the three months that ended September, the Seattle-based company is expected to earn 3 cents per share on revenue of $42.05 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when the company earned 52 cents per share on $32.71 billion in revenue. For the full year, ending December, EPS is expected to be $3.63 per share, down from $4.90 per share a year ago, while full year revenue of $174.65 billion would rise 28.4% year over year. Clearly, the e-commerce giant is still projected to put up impressive growth numbers. Notably, this is even though Amazon — now valued at close to $500 billion — is almost twice the size of Wal-Mart (WMT). That said, the company did miss its second quarter earnings estimates and signaled increased capital spending, which spooked investors into selling AMZN stock. The shares took a massive haircut as a result, falling from its all-time high of $1,083 to around $936. While the shares have rebounded somewhat, the stock is still down 7% in three months, suggesting investors are anxious whether CEO Jeff Bezos — as he’s known to do — will decide if it’s time to mash the profit accelerator or continue to building out his vision, which ultimately means higher spending. As such, on Thursday, analysts will also focus on the company’s profit margins, looking for any hint into Bezos’ thinking and whether the stock deserves its consensus price target of $1163, which calls for 20% rise from current levels. Amazon continues to invest in ways to strengthen its logistics, while also expanding internationally. The company’s plans for Whole Foods acquisition will also be a hot topic. Amazon, which immediately cut prices of some selected grocery products, has wasted no time dictating food prices. The acquisition is a way for Amazon to broaden its Prime shopper base. How much of a contribution has Whole Foods made? Piper Jaffray analysts are modeling for $1.4 billion. Beyond the top and bottom line numbers and the impact of Whole Foods, the Street will want to see how the company’s AWS (Amazon Web Services) cloud platform performs, which will dictate how much of a focus should be placed on the company’s capital spending. AWS boats more than half of Fortune 500 companies on the platform to run their businesses. It’s still the clear-cut leader in cloud market share and accounts for more than half of Amazon's operating profits in 2016, up ten percentage points than 2015. At the same time, however, competing cloud platforms from Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) are gaining traction. In the second quarter, AWS revenue rose 42% year over year to $4.1 billion, showing that it is still growing impressively. To the extent AWS, which grew 55% in the year-ago quarter, can grow at 40%-plus Thursday the Street will be pleased. This is because despite the growth deceleration, AWS is still growing twice as faster the retail segment, while producing operating margins that are ten times higher. In other words, AWS carries tons of muscle. And if Amazon can flex more of it Thursday the stock should fly towards all-time highs, and in the process assuaging investor fears about any increased sending the company may wish to adopt to maintain its competitive edge.

Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) posted its third-quarter results Thursday afternoon. The company reported its earnings after the market closed, which saw AMZN shares soar on the e-commerce retailer’s impressive results. Earnings came in at 52 cents per share, which was in line with the year-ago mark. Revenue was a strong point for Amazon, coming in at $43.7 billion, ahead of the $42.19 billion that analysts were calling for, and ahead of the year-ago mark by 34%. One of the most important elements of the period was the acquisition of Whole Foods, which saw the retailer take over a segment of the grocery industry. Prime Day was important for the company as it helped retail growth to increase, especially in international markets, according to the company’s CFO. Amazon Web Services is the strongest segment of the retailer, growing 42% year-over-year and amounting to 11% of the company’s total revenue. The cloud computing unit is also growing at a fast rate for the retailer, surging to $4.6 billion in the period, ahead of the $3.2 billion from a year ago. Amazon predicts that it will rake in between $56 billion and $60.5 billion in sales during its fourth quarter, which marks a growth of between 28% and 38% for the period. The forecast is fueled by the Whole Foods acquisition, as well as a favorable foreign exchange rate. Operating income is slated to be between $300 million and $1.65 billion, compared with $1.3 billion in the year-ago quarter. AMZN shares soared 7.6% after the bell.

Source: Shutterstock Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has released a barrage of new hardware in the past few months, including new Echo smart speakers and the Cloud Cam home security camera. They all contribute to AMZN stock by adding to revenue, and getting Alexa — the company’s personal assistant — out there, getting smarter with each use and helping owners to buy more stuff online. Now the company is launching a feature that lets you see what these products will look like in your home. Amazon’s new AR View is a capability within its Amazon App for iOS that uses Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) ARKit augmented reality framework. That’s right, the new Amazon shopping app is leveraging Apple’s technology to convince people to buy more things and boost AMZN revenue. Amazon announced AR View in a press release about its Black Friday Deals Store. What is AR View? Here’s Amazon’s pitch: “Customers can shop when they want, where they want with the Amazon App, which now includes a brand new augmented reality feature, AR view, for customers to see how thousands of items look in their space before they buy.” In other words, this is augmented reality capability for the Amazon shopping app, which makes good use of Apple’s new ARKit framework. Select a product on Amazon.com in the app, choose the AR View feature, click the iPhone’s camera button and the app places a photorealistic 3D model of he object within the customer’s home. They can move the product around within the field of view, rotate it and generally get a very good idea of what something like a new Echo Show might look like in their home. Products supported at launch include small appliances, electronics and toys. The feature can be used on the iPhone 6s and up. If AR View sounds familiar, it should. The new feature in the Amazon shopping app is almost identical to one Ikea released in the early days of ARKit. Early days being the summer — technology moves fast. From an investment perspective, AR View itself does nothing directly for AMZN stock. Customers aren’t paying for the feature. What it does is make the Amazon shopping app more appealing to use. That makes it more likely shoppers may click the button to add an item to their cart. And because AR View lets them get a pretty realistic view of what the item would look like in their home, it’s possible that AR View may help to reduce return rates on some merchandise.

https://seekingalpha.com/news/3307136-amazons-cryptocurrency-domain-names

Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has registered three new domain names related to cryptocurrency, sparking speculation that the e-commerce giant may accept it as payments or even move into the space. They include: amazonethereum.com, amazoncryptocurrency.com and amazoncryptocurrencies.com. Amazon already signed up for the domain "amazonbitcoin.com" three years ago and the address takes you straight to Amazon.com. Now read: Amazon: Paging All Activists » 

http://mashable.com/2017/11/02/amazon-cryptocurrency-domain-names/

Amazon is not-so quietly shaping the future around its ever-expanding business, so it makes sense they'd want to get in on cryptocurrency, too.  The company wants to build a fleet of package-delivering drones. They maybe want to build giant drone hives in a city near you. They've got grocery stores and devices you can ask to set a timer or play a song. Now, according to Whois data, an Amazon subsidiary registered amazoncryptocurrencies.com, amazoncryptocurrency.com, and amazonethereum.com on Oct. 31.  SEE ALSO: Not everyone's desperate for Amazon's second headquarters The news was first reported by DomainNameWire, and, as they wrote, Amazon might just be buying up the names so nobody else can profit off a feigned association with their brand. Coindesk pointed out that Amazon registered amazonbitcoin.com four years ago, and that just redirects to the company's regular homepage.  Or maybe Jeff Bezos recently spent some time reading about how Bitcoin is doing better than ever, and decided to jump into the cryptocurrency pool.  We reached out to Amazon for more information, but didn't immediately hear back.

Amazon (Shutterstock photo) Two days ago, after UPS (UPS) beat earnings expectations, I wrote an article that suggested buying Amazon (AMZN) ahead of earnings. I was pleased to see the massive beat that they reported yesterday, but when that is combined with some other news from yesterday, it is clear that you should hang on to at least some of that stock for the long term. Earnings dominated yesterday’s news, with well over three hundred public companies reporting their results for the third quarter. There can be no doubt as to the big winners in earnings yesterday. Two other giant U.S. tech companies, Alphabet (GOOG: GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) joined Amazon in beating expectations by wide margins, but there were plenty of other stories to consider. We heard that CVS (CVS) is trying to buy health insurer Aetna (AET) in a reportedly $66 billion deal, and department store JC Penney (JCP) released yet another gloomy outlook. There was a flood of seemingly unrelated news from multiple sources, but those stories can all be connected through Amazon. The most obvious connection is that between Amazon and the two companies whose main business is retail, CVS and JCP. There is a common narrative that says that Amazon is destroying traditional retail right now, but that is not strictly accurate. They are dominant in e-commerce for sure, but still only account for a small percentage of total U.S. retail sales, and are significantly smaller in that regard than somebody like Wal-Mart (WMT). What is really causing ructions is not Amazon’s current market share, but fear of what is to come. The move by CVS, for example, could be just another example of consolidation by vertical integration that has become all the rage in the healthcare market rather than as having anything to do with Amazon. The healthcare system in the U.S. leads the world by far in terms of costs and yet is way down the list in terms of outcomes, and that has been the case for decades, so something has to change. Consolidation is, according to the companies involved, a way of improving efficiency and the patient experience, although more cynical minds may look at it as an attempt to become too big to fail before the finger of blame points in their direction. Merging CVS, who started as a retail company but is already involved in service delivery (Minute Clinics) and pharmacy benefit management, with an insurer makes sense on several levels not related to Amazon. However, it cannot be a coincidence that the idea is floated as it becomes increasingly clear that Bezos et al are about to get into the retail pharmacy business. What is driving things here is not Amazon’s current presence or market share, but fear of what they may and could do to profitability. That fear is justified. What Amazon has shown in the past is that they are quite prepared to operate on razor-thin margins to fund growth, and that the market is quite happy with that situation. The operating margin of under 1% that Amazon “achieved” this quarter would sink many other stocks, even in growth-oriented companies, but Amazon is, rightfully, given a pass on that by investors. I have pointed out before that what many miss when they talk about the so called “Amazon model,” where profits don’t matter and growth is pursued constantly, is that Amazon has shown in the past that they can turn on the profit tap, seemingly at will. From 2007-2010, as the recession hit retail hard, they more than doubled their profits before going back to massive investment and often losses in the following years. That ability makes growth at Amazon even more valuable. I cannot say that their impressive report came as a surprise, as is obvious from the above referenced article.  What did, though, was the extent to which nearly every corporate news story that broke yesterday is connected to Amazon’s performance and growth. Some might argue that ultimately that will not prove to be healthy, but what it says right now is that AMZN still has a lot more upside, and that yesterday’s jump in the stock is just the beginning.

Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) reminded Wall Street last night that it is still a growth powerhouse … at least on the revenue side of things. But then, sales growth has never really been a problem for Amazon. The company has seen revenue rise by more than 20% annually for the past five years. Amazon’s problem has always been spending, and regardless of today’s AMZN stock rally, you can the results clearly in the company’s earnings. Prior to last quarter, Amazon had posted net income growth for eight straight quarters. That winning streak ended in July, as Amazon increased spending on content for Amazon Prime Video and shelled out $13.7 billion for Whole Foods. Still, third-quarter earnings results were better than expected — including spending. Amazon said it earned 52 cents per share, and, while not a gain, results were flat with the same quarter last year. Analysts were expecting heavier spending, with earnings forecasts looking for a profit in a range of 2 cents to 7 cents per share, depending on who you ask. While spending will remain a concern heading into 2018, it looks like Amazon has things under control for the time being. And that’s a major boon heading into the holiday shopping season … and for AMZN stock options traders. Sentiment is only growing stronger on Amazon stock. The brokerage community emerged this morning to flood the shares with AMZN stock price target increases: What’s more, Amazon has also scored at least a pair of ratings upgrades from Raymond James (to outperform from market perform) and Monness Crespi Hardt (to buy from neutral). Overall, Thomson/First Call reports that 39 of the 44 analysts following AMZN stock have given it a “buy” or better. 
Click to Enlarge That’s a lot of bullish sentiment that would give any contrarian cause for concern. But AMZN stock technicals are still backing the bullish line. The shares opened more than 9% higher this morning, putting Amazon stock above former resistance at $1,050. Given the shares’ momentum, $1,100 could be well within AMZN’s reach by the end of the year — if not the end of next month.

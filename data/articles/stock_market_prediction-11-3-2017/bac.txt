Shares of Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) are now higher by more than 25% year-to-date and looking strong. Helped by a spike in interest rates — as a result of a marginally more hawkish Federal Reserve and other G4 central banks — BAC stock has staged a technically sound breakout that could move higher. Like I always say in this here column, without the proper perspective on the markets any given trader or investor over time will likely stand to give back a large chunk of his or her gains. As such, the current shift in central bank posturing is crucial for investors and trades focusing on banking and other financial stocks. Over the past days, weeks and even months we have heard from a multitude of important central banks that they are slowly shifting to a more hawkish tone, if only moderately so. On the multi-year weekly chart, we see that BAC stock (top part of the chart) dropped sharply along with the rest of financial companies and indeed the broader market during the 2008/2009 financial crisis. After years of “basing,” BofA blasted higher following the U.S. election, and by so doing scored a technical breakout. Upside momentum however quickly again began to wane and the stock didn’t do much for bullish investors from early March until this past September. After a prolonged period of rest BAC stock in September finally took the next leg higher, which now looks to have further upside. 
Click to Enlarge Moving averages legend: red – 200 week, blue – 100 week, yellow – 50 week At the bottom of the chart, in blue, I plotted a ratio chart of the Financial Select SPDR (NYSEARCA:XLF) versus the S&P 500’s SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY). On this chart we see that the relative strength of financial stocks as a group has improved versus the broader large-cap market and indeed now looks giddy to break higher. In other words, BAC stock could be in for a period of not only absolute but also relative strength in the broader picture. 
Click to Enlarge Moving averages legend: red – 200 day, blue – 100 day, yellow – 50 day Moving on to the daily chart we see that as a result of the September breakout of the multi-quarter consolidation phase (black lines), the BAC stock’s intermediate-term moving averages have all begun to curl up again, which is constructive for the time being and should all else being equal offer a layer of technical support. After the September breakout got overheated BAC stock in the second half of October started to rest again. While the stock remains in this near-term resting period, odds look favorable that ultimately a continuation-move higher sets in toward year-end. Active investors and traders could look to buy BAC around current levels in the mid to high $27s for a next upside target at $29, followed by possibly $30 — although I do not expect this move to take place in a straight line.

Bank of America Corporation (BAC) is an interesting player in the Financial space, with a focus on Money Center Banks. The stock has been active on the tape, currently trading at $27.39, down from yesterday’s close by -0.76%. Given the stock’s recent action, it seemed like a good time to take a closer look at the company’s recent data. Fundamental Analysis Money managers are always interested in a company that can find the right recipe of fundamental data because it reflects something important going on underneath the surface. Bank of America Corporation (BAC) currently trades with a market capitalization of $288.36 Billion. That value represents a market adjusting for revenues that have been growing by 16.23 % on a quarterly year/year basis as of the company’s last quarterly report. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For BAC, you can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $-13.11 Billion over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to fall in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $0.48 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 69.34% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors. Technical Analysis It’s important to check the technicals to get a sense of how BAC has been acting. Looking at the stock’s movement on the chart, Bank of America Corporation recorded a 52-week high of $27.98. It is now trading 0.59% off that level. The stock is trading $25.24 its 50-day moving average by -2.15%. The stock carved out a 52-week low down at $16.28. In recent action, Bank of America Corporation (BAC) has made a move of +5.92% over the past month, which has come on weak relative transaction volume. Over the trailing year, the stock is underperforming the S&P 500 by 22.64, and it’s gotten there by action that has been more volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. In terms of the mechanics underlying that movement, traders will want to note that the stock is trading on a float of 1.09% with $10.45 Billion sitting short, betting on future declines. That suggests something of the likelihood of a short squeeze in shares of BAC.

Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) fell by -0.76% in Wednesday’s trading session from $27.60 to $27.39 and has now fallen 3 consecutive sessions. The stock price went upward in 6 of the last 10 days and has generated 4.54% during the last two weeks. There was a decrease in both volume and price. This is usually interpreted as a good sign as traders widely believe falling stock should see declining volume. Traded activity experienced a fall of -1.08 million shares and in total 50.10 M shares exchanged hands for about $1 372.26 million. Inside BAC’s Recent Trend Bank of America Corporation (BAC) lies in the middle of a wide and strong rising trend in the short term and issued considerable signs about additional rally. Short-term traders are predicted to see a rally of 14.36% over the course of a quarter and, with 90% chance the price will be floating in the range of $28.53 and $32.43 in this timeframe. Bank of America Corporation Technical Signals 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 BAC has witnessed its short term MA triggering a sell signal. Meanwhile, however, the long-term average has generated a buy signal. When the short-run moving average rises above its longer-term trend, a buy signal is created. This is because a short-run moving average that crosses its long-run moving average counterpart is seen as the initiation of an upward trend. On additional rally, the share price will meet short term resistance at around $27.57. On a drop, the stock is likely to find some support over the long run, which begins at $25.93. A buy signal will be generated if it crosses above the short term moving average. Meanwhile, however, a price crossing below the long term moving average will generate a sell signal. Some other technical concerns emerged as well, putting in risk the future growth of the stock in the next couple of days. Its pivot point high generated sell signal on Friday October 27, 2017, which calls for additional declines until the stock forms a new pivot point low, as this could be a buying opportunity. The downbeat movement of both volume and price during the recent session is interpreted as a good sign because traders usually believe falling stock should see declining volume. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) Support And Resistance Levels In case of pullback, the next support the price will capture from accumulated volume will not be far away from current price at $25.83 and $25.45. In case of gains, the next resistance from accumulated volume will not be far away from today’s level at $27.63, $27.68 and $27.80. 
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 It is important to note, however, that the stock needs to make its way through natural risk while testing a key support level. Once this support is broken, another support level will be to be established at a lower level. Turning back to this stock, Bank of America Corporation approaches the first support point just current price at $25.83. In case of a break, the next support we will see from accumulated volume is going to be at $25.45 and $23.31. Accumulated volume is going to prevent the price from rising further at $27.63 and this action will lead the price to take a temporary pause or stay muted for a few days. Bank of America Corporation (BAC) Risk Assessment The number of shares changed hands in the stock is good, indicating the interest and low risk associated with it. In the most recent session, the stock price hovered around $0.38 (1.39%) between intraday high and intraday low. Each day in the past 1 week, the average volatility remained at 1.38%.

http://variety.com/2017/film/global/bac-films-gets-lured-by-paolo-virzis-magical-nights-exclusive-1202605629/

Bac Films is set to re-team with Paolo Virzi for “Magical Nights,” a black comedy set in 1990s Rome that marks the Italian helmer’s follow-up to the Helen Mirren-Donald Sutherland starrer “The Leisure Seeker.” Bac Films has taken French distribution and international sales rights. The Paris-based outfit previously collaborated with Virzi on “The Leisure Seeker,” “Like Crazy” and “Human Capital.” Mixing film noir and satirical comedy, “Magical Nights” explores the golden age of Italian cinema in Rome through the tale of three promising screenwriters who turn out to be the main suspects for the murder of a famous producer. The film takes place in the 1990s, after the producer is found dead in the Tiber river on the night of soccer’s World Cup Finale.  While they are being questioned by the police about their relationship with the producer, the three writers reminisce about the splendors and miseries of Italian cinema’s Golden Age all the way through its twilight years. 






 “Magical Nights” stars Italian newcomers Mauro Lamantia, Giovanni Toscano and Irene Vetere, who will play the screenwriters; the cast is completed by Giancarlo Giannini, Roberto Herlitzka, Paolo Bonacelli and Ornella Muti. “Magical Nights” is being produced by Marco Belardi for Lotus Production, a company owned by the Leone Film Group. Rai Cinema is co-producing, with 01 Distribution handling the theatrical release in Italy. The movie, penned by Francesca Archibugi and Francesco Piccolo, is currently shooting in Rome and is expected to be delivered during the second quarter of 2018. “The Leisure Seeker” will be released in the U.S. by Sony Pictures Classics in January.

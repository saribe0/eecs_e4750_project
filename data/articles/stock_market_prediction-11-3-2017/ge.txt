Third-quarter earnings at General Electric Company (NYSE: GE) were basically a disaster -- with CEO John Flannery calling the company's performance "unacceptable." It's no wonder the shares plunged after the report. But is it time for investors to run for the hills or an opportunity to invest in this industrial giant? There are definitely risks today, but if you have the stomach for turnarounds, they may be worth taking on.    General Electric sports more than a 4% dividend yield today. That's very enticing when an S&P 500 Index fund will get you only around 2%. Before the third-quarter earnings report, I believed that the dividend was on solid ground, but now I'm not so sure. If the only reason you're interested in GE is the yield, you should probably be looking somewhere else at this point. Put simply, the risk of a cut is large. Image source: Getty Images. My concern stems from the fact that Flannery highlighted during the third-quarter conference call his awareness of how important the dividend is to shareholders. However, he went on to explain that the company needed to balance its growth plans against the dividend.    My guess is that the dividend gets trimmed now so that the CEO, who only took the helm a few months ago, can get all of the bad news out of the way. It's the kitchen-sink approach, which will help to make the rest of his tenure look better. That said, it looks as if General Electric's problems are really near-term in nature today. But it's understandable if investors are a little skittish. During the 2007-to-2009 recession, GE's entire future was put in peril by its oversized financial arm. The troubles at that business even led to a government bailout for the company.    But the CEO at the time, Jeffery Immelt, went to work streamlining the industrial giant back to its core. He sold off assets that didn't fit, like a television network, and jettisoned financial businesses that didn't directly support GE's industrial business, like insurance operations. Immelt left his successor with a much more focused company. The big-picture view of the GE's tough third quarter. Image source: General Electric Company.  The work, however, isn't done yet. And Flannery plans to use his first days as the head of GE to cut costs, selling off the corporate jets and killing a free-car program for managers, and to continue the streamlining process, including completing the sale of the water business and getting out of consumer lighting. But this is a vastly different job from what Immelt was left to deal with when Jack Welch handed him a company that had, in hindsight, veered off course by venturing too far into the finance business.    I'm not wearing rose-colored glasses. GE's third-quarter results stank, missing analyst earnings expectations by a massive 40%. There was plenty of bad news, with operating profit in the energy business down 50%, oil and gas off by 35%, and transportation operating profits falling 11%. Although some of its business did OK, the negatives pushed industrial segment profits down by 10%. Another problem was shrinking margins, hence the cost-cutting effort.    General Electric is clearly not hitting on all cylinders today. But it still has an iconic brand name, dominant positions in the industries it serves, and a reputation for quality. Moreover, some of the key markets it serves are weak today, notably oil and gas, but that won't last forever. When typically cyclical industries like that pick up again, some big headwinds will become tailwinds.  GE data by YCharts The company's finances, meanwhile, are pretty solid, though at first blush you might be tempted to think otherwise. Long-term debt makes up around two-thirds of the company's capital structure. But if you add in the massive $78 billion in cash and marketable securities on the balance sheet, that number drops to around 30%. Despite the falling stock price, there's little reason to believe GE is going to go out of business today. It just needs to get its business heading in the right direction.    GE's shares have vastly underperformed its industrial peers for a very good reason: Things aren't going well today. And with a new CEO, it's likely the next year or so will continue to be tough as he moves quickly to get as much bad news behind him as possible. That increasingly looks as if it will mean a dividend cut. But this isn't a life-or-death situation. It's more like resetting investor expectations. And once this "tough love" period is over, GE will likely start to look a lot more interesting. But at this point, you'll need a thick skin to stick around because the headlines are likely to be negative for at least another 12 months or so. Just remember that the risks today aren't the same as the ones GE was dealing with back during the financial meltdown.

At this point, investing in General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) feels like catching a falling knife. GE stock has lost almost 16% this month. What happened? GE on Oct. 20 reported its first profit miss in two-and-a-half years. It cut its full-year earnings guide and indicated that a dividend cut may be coming soon. GE stock proceeded to fall 13% over the following week. That was the stock’s worst five-day period since March 2009, when the S&P 500 was touching Great Recession lows.  It is moments like these when Warren Buffet’s wisdom shines brightest. Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful. GE stock isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. This is a company that has been around for 125 years and played a critical role in shaping the modern world. The company has hit some tough times recently due to weakness in its Power and Oil and Gas businesses, but management is appropriately diversifying where they need to, cutting fat where they need to, and investing where they need to. A turnaround isn’t a matter of “if”. Its a matter of “when”. I think “when” to buy GE stock is now or at least very soon. Right now, everyone is worried about the 4.7%-yielding dividend getting cut at the November investor meeting. That will likely happen. But GE stock has sold off in a manner that indicates that the stock price is now baked with expectations for a cut. Risks related to a dividend reduction seem mitigated, while rewards related to no cut seem high. The dividend issue seems to be a microcosm for the whole GE issue. There is a lot negativity priced into this name right now, so much so that the risk-reward profile on GE stock is starting to skew considerably towards the upside. General Electric’s Power and Oil and Gas businesses are getting killed. Revenue is falling and profits are falling even more. General Electric has long been known as a power and oil and gas company. So when those three business segments fail, GE stock does not work. But even with those businesses struggling mightily, GE still only saw organic revenue decline 1% last quarter. Operating profit slipped 7%, and earnings were off by 9%. If that’s as bad as it gets for General Electric, then the company must be doing a bunch of other things right. Indeed, General Electric is executing on other fronts. Excluding power and oil and gas, organic revenues rose 2%. Aviation and Healthcare posted strong quarterly profit gains. In fact, all segments excluding power and oil and gas expanded profit margins last quarter. Meanwhile, GE is flirting with potentially super-charged growth in the Internet of Things (IoT) segment. For each big industrial device  General Electric sells, the company can add a little sensor to it. That essentially makes the industrial equipment smart. This smart equipment harvests loads of data and sends it to GE, where its analyzed and then presented to the buyer in a logical, actionable manner.

Photographer: Simon Dawson/Bloomberg It must be feeling an awful lot like 2009 for General Electric Co. shareholders. That’s not a good thing. The stock fell Thursday for the ninth straight daily loss, the longest in eight years. During the latest streak, GE also suffered the worst single-week decline since March 2009 and closed its biggest monthly drop since February of that year. The recession-era slump has become a frequent point of comparison as the industrial giant struggles with a raft of problems, from poor cash flow to weak power and oil markets. New Chief Executive Officer John Flannery has said he’ll consider all options to revitalize GE, which is the worst performer by far on the Dow Jones Industrial Average this year. The shares fell 0.4 percent to close at $19.94 Thursday in New York. GE has dropped 37 percent this year, wiping out more than $100 billion in market value, even as broader indexes have risen. JPMorgan Chase & Co. on Wednesday cut its price target for GE to $17 a share from $19, with analyst Stephen Tusa citing weak revenue and profit in the power-generation business. Jeff Sprague, an analyst with Vertical Research Partners, warned that a rebound may be underwhelming. “Once the bottom is in, GE will still have a challenging growth outlook,” Sprague said in a note. “While there could be a short-term technical pop, the fundamental recovery will take time.” Investors and analysts are also bracing for a possible dividend cut, particularly after the Boston-based company last month slashed its cash-flow forecast for 2017. Flannery, who took the top post in August, hasn’t ruled out such a move. If the payout is reduced, it would be the first time since -- you guessed it -- 2009.

 The bizarre case of General Electric’s use of a second corporate jet to follow its former chief executive, Jeff Immelt, as he hopscotched around the globe seems such an outlandish waste of money that many reacted with disbelief after The Wall Street Journal reported it on Oct. 18. “I literally felt sick to my stomach,” Scott Davis, an analyst and founding partner of Melius Research who has covered G.E. for years, told me this week. “I immediately called the company and asked if this could possibly be true.” Mr. Davis said G.E. had told him that the issue had been “blown all out of proportion.” Publicly, the company said that the two-plane arrangement was used only on “limited occasions” and had been halted by Mr. Immelt in 2014. That response prompted The Journal to report this week that the second jet — known in aviation circles as a “chase plane” — had followed Mr. Immelt’s aircraft as recently as March, when two G.E. jets flew to Anchorage after taking off from Boston within minutes of each other. The second plane stayed in Alaska for five days while Mr. Immelt went on to South Korea and China. After he returned to Anchorage, the plane followed him back to Boston. Advertisement The Journal documented multiple additional instances of two jets being used after the practice had supposedly stopped. Advertisement Mr. Immelt told The Journal he wasn’t aware of the practice and wouldn’t have allowed it. When I inquired about it this week, he acknowledged, through a spokesman, that he first became aware that it was happening in 2014, after a whistle-blower complained about it and the board’s audit committee ordered it stopped. He said he didn’t know the practice had continued after that. Mr. Immelt elaborated in a letter he sent this week to John J. Brennan, the chairman and chief executive of Vanguard and currently G.E.’s lead director. A copy of the letter was made available to The New York Times. 
                “Given my responsibilities as C.E.O. of a 300,000-employee global company, I just did not have time to personally direct the day-to-day operations of the corporate air team,” he wrote.             “Given my responsibilities as C.E.O. of a 300,000-employee global company, I just did not have time to personally direct the day-to-day operations of the corporate air team,” Mr. Immelt wrote. “I had every right to expect that it was professionally run. Other than to say ‘Hello,’ I never spoke to the leader of corporate air in 16 years.” He continued: “They decided to deploy a ‘backup’ plane when I traveled on complicated, multi-stop trips or when we were traveling to areas with security concerns. This practice was brought to my attention and stopped three years ago. Let me reiterate, when I was in China or Pakistan or Turkey or Angola, the administration of our planes was never something I thought about, talked about or considered in any way.” A G.E. spokeswoman told The Journal that the use of the chase plane had drawn “understandable” criticism but did not fairly reflect Mr. Immelt’s “dedicated service” over 30 years. (In his letter, Mr. Immelt said he “worked 100-hour weeks with more than 60 percent of my time on the road.”) Mr. Davis of Melius Research sharply disagreed, saying Mr. Immelt “was the imperial C.E.O.’’ “Not even heads of state get that kind of treatment,’’ Mr. Davis said. “You hear about this and you have to wonder what else they were spending money on. You really you have to question the financial oversight and controls and internal audit. You have to question the entire organization.” Charles Elson, a professor and director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware, agreed. “This isn’t a minor issue,’’ he said. “This may be why G.E. is in such trouble these days. It’s representative of an old-style C.E.O. culture that hasn’t helped G.E.” Professor Elson added, “My students were discussing this in class today.” Advertisement That G.E. is in trouble is beyond question. The company’s shares have taken a beating as the impact of Mr. Immelt’s long tenure as C.E.O. have come into sharper focus since G.E. announced in June that he would depart as chief executive. Even with the stock market in record territory, G.E. shares have dropped more than 36 percent this year, earning the company the dubious distinction of having the worst-performing stock in the Dow Jones industrial average. This week G.E. shares were barely trading above $20. The chase-plane affair, and the company’s handling of it, has hardly inspired investor confidence. G.E. “was a great American company and now its reputation is tarnished and the brand is damaged,” Mr. Davis said. It also hasn’t helped, Professor Elson said, that G.E.’s “explanations have only given rise to more questions,” starting with how much the practice cost shareholders. Start with the ostensible reason for the second plane: to provide additional security and to have a spare in case of a breakdown, according to G.E. No one I spoke to in the field of corporate security said that made any sense, especially in the instance when the second plane stayed in Anchorage while Mr. Immelt traveled to Asia. There are plenty of planes there that could be chartered in case of emergency, not to mention commercial flights with first-class cabins and ample security. Robert Strang, a corporate security expert and the chief executive of the Investigative Management Group, told me he has been conducting security audits for chief executives for 29 years and could think of no similar example. “If a destination is so dangerous that it requires a backup plane, then a C.E.O. shouldn’t be going in the first place,” he said. And it’s not as if Mr. Immelt was traveling to war-torn Syria or Afghanistan.  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

Mr. Strang said that dispatching a second plane in case of mechanical breakdown would seem excessive, given that airplanes in other places could be used in case of emergency. “I don’t understand the logic of a second airplane,” he said. G.E. has acknowledged that the use of a chase plane was the subject of a whistle-blower complaint that led to a board-level review and directive to end the practice in 2014. The company’s corporate-travel department, which oversaw the two-plane arrangement, reported to John Lynch, the human resources leader, until 2013, when Susan Peters succeeded him. G.E. said that Ms. Peters and the general counsel at the time, Brackett Denniston, participated in the audit committee review that resulted in the directive to stop using the chase plane. A G.E. spokeswoman said that Ms. Peters was not available for comment. Mr. Denniston declined to comment, and Mr. Lynch could not be reached for comment. Advertisement G.E. has declined to say, who, exactly, in the corporate-travel department came up with the chase-plane idea or acted on it; who kept it going after the audit committee ordered it stopped; or whether anyone was disciplined as a consequence. Mr. Immelt wrote in his letter: “I am aware, that in the course of the last 10 years, we have had four managers of corporate air. For a time, it was clear that G.E. had a difficult time keeping its planes flying,” even though the company is a supplier of jet engines to the world’s major plane manufacturers. That Mr. Immelt didn’t know about the use of the chase plane, and failed to stop it after he learned about it, raises more questions and concerns, Professor Elson said. “If something of that significance wasn’t brought to his attention, then that’s a serious reporting and management failure,” he said. (Professor Elson said he was a longtime G.E. shareholder.) A G.E. spokeswoman, Jennifer Erickson, declined to comment beyond the company’s previous statements. The company’s new chief executive, John L. Flannery, has grounded the planes and plans to sell G.E.’s corporate fleet to cut costs (company executives will now fly on commercial flights or charter jets). He is under mounting pressure to restore investor confidence and stop the stock slide. An activist investor, Nelson Peltz’s Trian Fund Management, got a seat on G.E.’s board last month. Investors are especially concerned about the fate of the company’s rich dividend; the stock currently yields well over 4 percent. G.E. is scheduled to hold an investor conference on Nov. 13, where Mr. Flannery is expected to unveil the results of a strategic review, which includes his restructuring plans and revised financial targets. That may be his best chance to turn a new leaf on Mr. Immelt’s troubled tenure. But until G.E. makes a clean breast of the chase jet affair, Mr. Flannery may be dogged by the many still-unanswered questions about it. “Flannery is saying the right things,” Mr. Davis said. But, he added, “there needs to be a formal investigation and full disclosure.” After so many years covering industrial companies, he said, “I thought I’d seen it all, until this. Millions of dollars were recklessly wasted, and shareholders deserve an accounting and assurance this won’t happen again.” We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.

Source: Shutterstock Since John Flannery became CEO of General Electric Co. (NYSE:GE) in June, the shares have lost nearly one-third of their value. The company missed badly on earnings for the September quarter. Flannery has signaled a major shake-up to be detailed November 13. Cash flow cratered as predecessor Jeff Immelt remade GE into an energy company, under the guise of industrial technology leadership. The 24-cents-per-share dividend, which now yields almost 5% but costs over $2 billion each quarter to maintain, is now threatened.  Some analysts doubt the company, which has been part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average since it began in 1896, can survive in its present form. But Immelt still has his supporters, spouting some dangerous spin about his fall and corporate democracy. Steve Blank of the Harvard Business Review recently blamed Immelt’s fall on “activist investors,” Ed Garden, chief investment officer of activist hedge fund Trian Partners, was recently added to the GE board.  To this, a former GE stockholder can only say, “Thank God.” Blank calls Trian a “corporate raider” interested only in short-term profit at the expense of investment. But what Flannery has found is that Immelt’s claims of progress were just that — claims. Even Blank admits to “poor execution in its traditional businesses.” Execution is the CEO’s job. While GE stock may be headed for the teens as it sells over $20 billion in assets to pay down $136 billion in debt, it can be saved. The same is not true for Under Armour Inc. (NYSE:UAA). That’s because founder Kevin Plank engineered a 2016 “stock split” creating a new class of shares, one designed to maintain his hold on the company. As with Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Twenty-First Century Fox Inc. (NASDAQ:FOXA), Plank has broken with corporate democracy. No activist can buy up Under Armour shares and threaten him, because his “Class C” shares control the company.

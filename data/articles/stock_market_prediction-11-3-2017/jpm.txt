Fortune Live Media via flickr    Wall Street stock analysts are about to find themselves on the chopping block, and only the best will survive.  That was the hard truth Mary Erdoes had for a room full of analysts Thursday at the BancAnalysts Association of Boston Conference. Erdoes, the head of JPMorgan Chase's $1.9 trillion asset and wealth management business, was asked about impacts from MiFID II — Europe's sweeping financial regulatory changes that will be implemented in 2018 — and painted a future in which asset mangers chop their budgets and only pay for research from top-tier analysts. "On the buy side, the larger firms will absorb the costs and figure out how that cascades its way through," Erdoes said. "It probably means they'll tighten up a lot on what they spend on sell-side research, which is why the two go hand in hand." Firms are planning to make cuts because MiFID II requires asset managers pay for research separately from commissions for trading execution, whereas it previously often came bundled with other products.  Most of the largest asset managers, including JPMorgan, are absorbing the multi-million dollar costs and funding the research internally, rather than passing the costs on to their customers. This is bad news for stock analysts, as it could result in a 50% "compression" in research budgets, according to Credit Suisse. That means less money to go around. Erdoes plainly laid out what happens next: "I was dealing with 10 of you; I don't want 10 of you anymore, I only want the five best of you." She noted that the sell-side research industry had already contracted massively in recent years, with investment banks spending "50% of what they used to spend." "So you're the precious few. The rest of them are not here. Maybe this room was five-times bigger before, I don't know," Erdoes told the audience of analysts, many of whom would presumably not be there the following year given the looming cuts. The upside? The research quality will improve as the fat is trimmed.  "It'll just make the industry better," Erdoes said. "It will constantly get you to excellence and get rid of the less than excellence." That's the cold hard truth sell-side stock analysts are facing: If you're not in the top-tier, the Mary Erdoes's of the world won't have much use for you anymore.  Some who get edged out, however, will likely find work within buy-side asset managers, she added.  Erdoes also anticipates the number of sell-side research providers will shrink, as the smaller firms will have to price competitively with the larger firms while still paying for top talent.  "It's going to be very difficult for the the bespoke, research-driven firms to be able to do that on the sell side," Erdoes said.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) fell by -0.79% in Tuesday’s trading session from $101.41 to $100.61 and has now fallen 3 consecutive sessions.. The stock price went upward in 7 of the last 10 days and has generated 3.06% during the last two weeks. There was a decrease in both volume and price. This is usually interpreted as a good sign as traders widely believe falling stock should see declining volume. Traded activity experienced a fall of -0.21 million shares and in total 8.63 M shares exchanged hands for about $868.19 million. Inside JPM’s Recent Trend JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) lies in the upper part of a strong rising trend in the short term, and this will normally pose a very good selling opportunity for the short-term trader as reaction back towards the lower part of the trend can be expected. A break-up at the top trend line at $102.06 will firstly indicate a stronger raising rate. Short-term traders are predicted to see a rally of 10.1% over the course of a quarter and, with 90% chance the price will be floating in the range of $103.31 and $112.37 in this timeframe. JPMorgan Chase & Co. Technical Signals 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 JPM has witnessed its short term MA triggering a sell signal. Meanwhile, however, the long-term average has generated a buy signal. When the short-run moving average rises above its longer-term trend, a buy signal is created. This is because a short-run moving average that crosses its long-run moving average counterpart is seen as the initiation of an upward trend. On additional rally, the share price will meet short term resistance at around $100.97. On a drop, the stock is likely to find some support over the long run, which begins at $96.68. A buy signal will be generated if it crosses above the short term moving average. Meanwhile, however, a price crossing below the long term moving average will generate a sell signal. Some other technical concerns emerged as well, putting in risk the future growth of the stock in the next couple of days. Its pivot point high generated sell signal on Friday October 27, 2017, which calls for additional declines until the stock forms a new pivot point low, as this could be a buying opportunity. The downbeat movement of both volume and price during the recent session is interpreted as a good sign because traders usually believe falling stock should see declining volume. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) Support And Resistance Levels JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) recorded volume accumulation so there will probably be a surplus of buyers at $96.84. In case of gains, the next resistance from accumulated volume will not be far away from today’s level at $100.92, $101.02 and $101.74. 
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Accumulated volume is going to prevent the price from rising further at $100.92 and this action will lead the price to take a temporary pause or stay muted for a few days. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) Risk Assessment The number of shares changed hands in the stock is good, indicating the interest and low risk associated with it. In the most recent session, the stock price hovered around $1.13 (1.12%) between intraday high and intraday low. Each day in the past 1 week, the average volatility remained at 1.14%.

JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) has been a major beneficiary of the stock market rally following the 2016 election. Since this time last year, shares of the New York City-based bank are up 44%. That's more than twice the S&P 500. It also comes in ahead of other large-cap banks, with the KBW Bank Index returning 38% over the same stretch. Given this performance, it's reasonable for investors to ask this question: Is JPMorgan Chase's stock cheap or expensive? Image source: Getty Images. A common way to measure a bank stock's valuation is to use the price-to-book value ratio, which is calculated by dividing a bank's share price by its book value per share. This tells you how much investors think a bank is worth relative to how much the bank purports to be worth on its balance sheet. A bank with a ratio above 1.0 is said to trade for a premium to book value. The implication is that investors think the bank will create value beyond its current net worth. Conversely, a bank that trades for less than book value per share is said to trade at a discount to book value. This implies that investors expect the bank's value to erode -- perhaps as a result of excess unrecognized loan losses. Data source: YCharts.com. Chart by author. In the case of JPMorgan Chase, its stock trades for 1.49 times its book value per share. That equates to a 49% premium to book value. Despite this, compared to other bank stocks, JPMorgan Chase stock doesn't come across as expensive. The median valuation on the KBW Bank Index is 1.41 times book value, or only eight basis points less than JPMorgan Chase. Data source: YCharts.com. Chart by author. A second way to measure a bank's valuation is to use the price-to-earnings ratio, or P/E ratio. You calculate this by dividing a bank's share price by its earnings per share. The P/E ratio reflects how much it costs an investor to buy $1 worth of a company's earnings. If the P/E ratio is 20, then it costs $20. If the ratio is 9, it costs $9. There is no general industry benchmark in terms of what constitutes a high or low P/E ratio for a bank stock. That said, one can compare a bank stock's P/E ratio to stocks that are both within the bank industry and outside of it; this is a key benefit of the P/E ratio over the price-to-book value ratio. *The median was used for the KBW Bank Index and the S&P 500. Data source: YCharts.com, The Wall Street Journal. Chart by author. In JPMorgan Chase's case, its stock trades for 14.2 times its earnings over the trailing 12 months. That compares to a median P/E ratio on the S&P 500, an index of large-cap stocks, of 23.2. The median on the KBW Bank Index is 16.8. By this measure, then, JPMorgan Chase's stock seems cheap, at least on a relative basis. While bank stocks like JPMorgan Chase may not have rich valuations right now, that doesn't mean they can't drop by a large margin; they can. One could make the argument, in fact, that stocks more broadly are in jeopardy of a correction right now, given the multiyear bull market in equities since the financial crisis. But holding all else equal, if you're going to buy a bank stock in this environment, it doesn't hurt to buy one like JPMorgan Chase, which has a reputation for being superbly managed and which trades at a reasonable valuation.

Investors have been carefully witnessing the recent activity of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) stock. Many experts agree that the truth about a stock is best reflected in the way it moves on the chart. For this stock, the chart has a lot to say about future performance. How has the stock performed recently? JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) in the last month has increased +6.67%. Shares are now up over the past year, outperforming the broad market by -100% and outperformed a peer group of similar companies by 59%. After the latest session, which saw the stock close at a price of $101.74, JPM sits below its 52-week high. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) has been trading in a bullish manner, based on the relative positions of the stock’s 20 and 200 day moving averages. Momentum indicators 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that JPM may be headed in the future. In order to predict this, technical analysts look at momentum indicators, which measure the speed and magnitude of these price movements. The idea is that as momentum slows, it may signal the approach of key support or resistance levels and a reversal of recent trends. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for JPM is 72.41%, which suggests that the stock may be primed for a trend reversal or a corrective pullback in price. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 93.41%, tells a similar story, and suggests that JPM currently trades in overbought territory. What do the trading volumes reveal? In addition to price, analysts use volume trends to predict future performance.

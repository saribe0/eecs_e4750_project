Investors in Lockheed Martin Corp (Symbol: LMT) saw new options begin trading today, for the December 22nd expiration. At Stock Options Channel , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the LMT options chain for the new December 22nd contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.  Because the $305.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 56%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.67% return on the cash commitment, or 12.20% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost .     Considering the fact that the $310.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

On our website under the contract detail page for this contract , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

Bargain hunters are wise to pay careful attention to insider buying, because although there are many various reasons for an insider to sell a stock, presumably the only reason they would use their hard-earned dollars to make a purchase, is that they expect to make money. Today we look at two noteworthy recent insider buys.      On Wednesday, Lockheed Martin ( LMT  )'s Director, Daniel F. Akerson, made a $780,059 buy of LMT, purchasing 2,500 shares at a cost of $312.02 each. Investors are able to buy LMT at a price even lower than Akerson did, with shares changing hands as low as $307.82 at last check today -- that's 1.3% under Akerson's purchase price. Lockheed Martin is trading up about 0.6% on the day Monday. This buy marks the first one filed by Akerson in the past twelve months.  makeArticleAd();    And at Mid-America Apartment Communities ( MAA  ), there was insider buying on Friday, by Director William Reid Sanders who bought 7,000 shares for a cost of $100.11 each, for a trade totaling $700,798.

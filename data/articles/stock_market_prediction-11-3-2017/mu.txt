https://www.healthdatamanagement.com/news/six-senators-co-sponsor-bill-to-give-providers-mu-flexibility

Six senators who are members of the Senate Health IT Working Group late Thursday reintroduced legislation intended to give providers some flexibility and relief from requirements of the Electronic Health Record Meaningful Use Program. The legislators have brought back the Electronic Health Record (EHR) Regulatory Relief Act (S. 2059); similar legislation was introduced in Congress last year to reduce compliance burdens faced by EHR users participating in the MU incentive program. Those backing the bill include Senators John Thune (R-S.D.), Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), Mike Enzi (R-Wy.), Pat Roberts (R-Kans.), Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Bill Cassidy (R-La.). The proposed legislation would ease requirements that currently are challenging for healthcare organizations to meet and annually the source of much industry pushback. Provisions include: Additionally, as implementation of the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System continues, the legislation would direct the Department of Health and Human Services to consider forthcoming recommendations from the Government Accountability Office to ensure flexibility in assessing physician performance. “Health information technology, especially the advancements in electronic health records, is an integral part of the future of America’s health care delivery system,” said Thune. “Our bill ensures that unnecessary regulatory burdens do not continue to negatively affect providers’ ability to leverage technology to improve patient care. With such strong and continued support for this legislation, I’m hopeful it will lead to swift and meaningful action in the Senate.” “This legislation will help reduce the regulatory burden doctors and hospitals have faced under the Meaningful Use program so they can instead focus on treating patients,” Alexander added. “I encourage the Senate to pass this bill to take a step towards getting our electronic health records system out of the ditch.” The College of Healthcare Information Management Executives, holding its Fall CIO Forum in San Antonio, Texas, was quick to offer support for the proposed legislation. “The policies proposed in this legislation have been on CHIME’s wish list to make the Meaningful Use program more reasonable for providers,” said Liz Johnson, Chair of CHIME Board of Trustees. “While the Meaningful Use program was instrumental in digitizing our industry, there is widespread recognition among the provider community that additional flexibilities are imperative to give providers the best chance at success as the program progresses. We appreciate the REBOOT group’s continued efforts to reduce the burden of the Meaningful Use program.”

Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) is an interesting player in the Technology space, with a focus on Semiconductor- Memory Chips. The stock has been active on the tape, currently trading at $44.38, up from yesterday’s close by 0.16%. Given the stock’s recent action, it seemed like a good time to take a closer look at the company’s recent data. Fundamental Analysis This company has been competing with others in the Technology space and offers its own combination of interesting factors Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) currently trades with a market capitalization of $50.24 Billion. That value represents a market adjusting for revenues that have been growing by 90.80 % on a quarterly year/year basis as of the company’s last quarterly report. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For MU, the company currently has $4.63 Billion of cash on the books, which is offset by $1.26 Billion current liabilities. You can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $3.43 Billion over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to fall in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $2.17 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 83.86% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors. Technical Analysis No analysis is ever complete without a thorough survey of a stock’s technical behavior. Looking at the stock’s movement on the chart, Micron Technology, Inc. recorded a 52-week high of $44.57. It is now trading 0.19% off that level. The stock is trading $37.21 its 50-day moving average by -7.17%. The stock carved out a 52-week low down at $16.45. In recent action, Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) has made a move of +12.18% over the past month, which has come on Strong relative transaction volume. Over the trailing year, the stock is underperforming the S&P 500 by 23.3, and it’s gotten there by action that has been more volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. In terms of the mechanics underlying that movement, traders will want to note that the stock is trading on a float of 5.03% with $1.09 Billion sitting short, betting on future declines. That suggests something of the likelihood of a short squeeze in shares of MU.

Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) has taken advantage of the 90% year-to-date run-up in the MU stock price to issue another $1.2 billion in common shares. Micron announced the equity deal in early October and upsized by $200 million. The timing could not be better given the buoyancy of the overall market and unfailing optimism toward tech stocks. So, how should shareholders of MU stock view this deal? On one hand, the net effect of such a transaction means dilution for existing shareholders. But on the other hand, the newly raised funds will be used to shore up Micron’s balance sheet, which has been burdened by the debt. Per the announcement, MU intends to use about a third of the net proceeds of the offering “to redeem approximately $438 million in aggregate principal amount of its 7.500% Senior Secured Notes due 2023 and pay accrued and unpaid interest thereon.” The remaining two thirds of net proceeds will also be put toward retiring debt instruments, though no specifics were provided. And then at the very end, there’s the obligatory catchall bucket of general corporate purposes. I understand the importance from a financial standpoint of debt coverage and systemic reduction to de-risk the balance sheet. But given the strong fourth quarter and full-year performance, I would have expected a portion of funds raised to go toward business development and innovation. After all, MU considers itself one of the foremost semiconductor companies, especially as it applies to memory tech. And these are areas where competitors are always neck and neck barring tech breakthroughs. So even if a minority of the offering would be put toward this crucial area, I would be more comfortable taking the dilution, if I were a shareholder. In all fairness, $1.2 billion is just 2.5% of Micron’s $48-billion market cap. But knowing the importance of capital allocation in a company’s future and survival when times are not necessarily as buoyant, I have reason to question management’s judgment. Ultimately, is this the savviest use of proceeds? Bankers are always there to advise on market conditions and timing of an offering, whether it’s debt or equity, but it’s up to the C-suite to decide how best to use the money in building the best business possible. I’m not convinced. Let’s then give some context in light of the full-year data. The business is clearly growing by leaps and bounds. For the fourth quarter, revenues jumped 91% year-over-year to $6.4 billion, and a net income of $2.4 billion means $1.99 per diluted share in earnings. For the full year, MU stock generated revenues of over $20 billion, representing a 64% increase YOY.

Hawaiian Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:HA) trades at $33.55 having a market capitalization of $1.75 billion. HA stock price lost -25.77% over the past year, yielding a negative weighted alpha of -36.8 percent. A weighted alpha below 0 suggest additional declines. Therefore, there is certainly still some pain for investors who want to avoid this falling stock.  Weighted Alpha is used to calculate how much a share has gone up or down over a certain period, normally a year. In general, more thrust is placed on most recent actions by assigning higher weights to it than those assigned to past movements. This assists to give a return figure that has a stronger focus on the most current period and is thus a better measure for short-term analysis. This technique is highly famous among technical analysts. If the stock is up it will have a positively weighted alpha. If the stock price is unchanged its weighted alpha will be smaller. A stock price loss will yield a negatively weighted alpha.  Support is likely to come between $32.96 a share to $32.36 a share level. However, if the HA shares go below $32.36 then it would indicate a much weaker market for the company. In that case, its shares would mark a 3.55% decline from the most recent price. The typical day in the last two weeks has seen about a 4.69% volatility. The average volume for Hawaiian Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:HA) has been 1.23 million shares per day over the past 30 days.

MU’s Stochastic Oscillator (%D) is at 69.41%. Values of %D line that are above 80 indicate that the security is overbought; prices could well fall in the near future. And the values below 20 that it is oversold indicate prices could very well bounce upwards. The Stochastic Oscillator is a powerful technical tool that is somewhat surprisingly easy to understand. In a basic sense, it is used by technicians to measure the speed or momentum of the price movement. It represents the location of the previous close relative to the price range over a set number of periods. This can be more easily understood, however, by pulling apart the two lines on the stochastic oscillator and explaining the simple underlying mathematical formulas. The first line is called the %K line, which analyzes the actual price movements in the shares and can be defined as: %K = (Current Close – Lowest Low)/(Highest High – Lowest Low) * 100. The second line, the %D line is simple a 3-day moving average of the %K line. There are three primary ways to read the Stochastic Oscillator in search of entry points, but traders should follow the %D line closely because that indicates major trends on the chart.

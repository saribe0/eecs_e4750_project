The day before Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is set to release the second season of its hit original series Stranger Things, let’s take a look at why the streaming service is still a great growth investment despite already soaring over the last few years. As many investors already know, growth stocks can be a ton of fun because they present the opportunity for potentially massive returns. With that said, investors can’t just pick stocks at random and hope they turn into the next Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). What they can do, however, is look for companies that currently present the possibility for hefty gains based on real growth opportunities within a business. Based on these criteria, growth-minded investors might think about taking a long look at Netflix stock. Last quarter, NFLX revenue jumped 33% in its all-important streaming sector. On top of that, the video-streaming powerhouse added 5.3 million subscribers—pushing the company’s total to 109.3 million worldwide. The company projects that it will add another 6.3 million subscriptions this quarter. Netflix also announced plans to spend up to $8 billion on content in 2018.

The price has fallen in 7 of the last 10 days and is down by -1.53% over the same course of time. Volume has increased in Wednesday’s trading session by 0.07 million shares, but on a weak note. This is may be an early warning and the risk will be increased slightly for the next couple of days. In total, 5.50 M shares exchanged hands for about $1 079.66 million. Inside NFLX’s Recent Trend Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) lies in the middle of a wide and strong rising trend in the short term and issued considerable signs about additional rally.

Netflix, Inc. Technical Signals 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 NFLX has witnessed its long term and short term MA triggering a buy signal. Many traders watch for short-term averages to cross above long-term averages to signal the beginning of a uptrend. Upon corrections, the price will meet support from the averages between $195.97 and $190.19. A break down through these support points will trigger sell signals. Some other technical concerns emerged as well, putting in risk the future growth of the stock in the next couple of days. Its pivot point high generated sell signal on Friday October 27, 2017, which calls for additional declines until the stock forms a new pivot point low, as this could be a buying opportunity. Volume up and price depreciating is getting our attention as this movement is seen as bearish sign. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) Support And Resistance Levels Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) recorded volume accumulation so there will probably be a surplus of buyers at $195.54. In case of gains, the next resistance from accumulated volume will not be far away from today’s level at $198.02, $199.48 and $202.68. 
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Accumulated volume is going to prevent the price from rising further at $198.02 and this action will lead the price to take a temporary pause or stay muted for a few days. Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) Risk Assessment The number of shares changed hands in the stock is good, indicating the interest and low risk associated with it. In the most recent session, the stock price hovered around $3.37 (1.73%) between intraday high and intraday low. Each day in the past 1 week, the average volatility remained at 1.99%.

The recent progress in the stock of Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has alerted everyone to look out for right opportunity to invest. Many analysts use price trends and patterns to predict future performance, and we can glean some important insights about NFLX by examining the chart. How has the stock performed recently? Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in the last month has increased +9.62%. Shares are now up over the past year, outperforming the broad market by -100% and outperformed a peer group of similar companies by 369%. After the latest session, which saw the stock close at a price of $196.43, NFLX sits below its 52-week high. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has been trading in a bullish manner, based on the relative positions of the stock’s 20 and 200 day moving averages. Momentum indicators 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that NFLX may be headed in the future. To do this, analysts often study the speed and magnitude of a stock’s price movements with what are known as momentum indicators. The logic is that as a stock’s momentum slows, it may be nearing key support or resistance levels and possibly the end of a current trend. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for NFLX is 57.47%, which suggests that the stock is not particularly expensive or cheap, and not predisposed to a reactive price movement based on this measure. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 75.27%, tells a different story, and suggests that NFLX currently trades in overbought territory. What do the trading volumes reveal? Volume patterns are useful for gauging the level of conviction behind price changes, and can be used to make predictions about future price movements. A sudden increase in a stock’s activity can be a sign that investors are trading in anticipation of a catalyst, or that investors feel very strongly in one way or the other about the future direction of a stock. Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) average trading volume of 9,867,880 during the past month is 46.76% above its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been more active than usual in the stock in recent times. What do the analysts think? NFLX is currently undervalued by -8.37% relative to the average 1-year price target of $214.38 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 2.20, which implies that analysts are generally neutral in their outlook for NFLX over the next year. How risky is the stock?  When analyzing a stock’s price performance, it’s essential to take risk into account. Beta, which measures a stock’s volatility relative to the overall market, can be used to gauge the level of systematic risk associated with a particular stock. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has a beta of 1.40, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are more extreme than the market as a whole. NFLX therefore has a above average level of market risk. During the past couple of weeks, NFLX average daily volatility was 21.20%, which is 12.66 percentage points lower than the average volatility over the past 100 days.

Since an alpha above 1 hints at more gains, investors can predict some further rally scope.  Weighted Alpha is used to calculate how much a share has gone up or down over a certain period, normally a year. In general, more thrust is placed on most recent actions by assigning higher weights to it than those assigned to past movements. This assists to give a return figure that has a stronger focus on the most current period and is thus a better measure for short-term analysis. This technique is highly famous among technical analysts. If the stock is up it will have a positively weighted alpha. If the stock price is unchanged its weighted alpha will be smaller. A stock price loss will yield a negatively weighted alpha.  Support is likely to come between $196.27 a share to $194.53 a share level. However, if the NFLX shares go below $194.53 then it would indicate a much weaker market for the company. In that case, its shares would mark a 1.75% decline from the most recent price.

In a basic sense, it is used by technicians to measure the speed or momentum of the price movement. It represents the location of the previous close relative to the price range over a set number of periods. This can be more easily understood, however, by pulling apart the two lines on the stochastic oscillator and explaining the simple underlying mathematical formulas. The first line is called the %K line, which analyzes the actual price movements in the shares and can be defined as: %K = (Current Close – Lowest Low)/(Highest High – Lowest Low) * 100. The second line, the %D line is simple a 3-day moving average of the %K line. There are three primary ways to read the Stochastic Oscillator in search of entry points, but traders should follow the %D line closely because that indicates major trends on the chart.

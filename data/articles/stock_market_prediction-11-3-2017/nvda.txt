Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has been on a huge rally recently. NVDA stock is up more than 15% over the past month and has solidly overtaken the $200 level. It seems like this is a growth stock that just can’t be stopped. But it pays to remember that every once and a while, earnings are a road bump in this growth story. Just look at the most recent earnings report. Despite big beats, NVDA stock dropped more than 5%. The same thing happened in February 2017, when a big earnings beat resulted in NVDA stock dropping. What do those two earnings reports have in common? NVDA stock had rallied big into both of those prints. But when NVDA doesn’t rally big into earnings, NVDA stock tends to jump big on solid numbers. See the May 2017 and November 2016 reports. Overall then, NVDA earnings are a “sell the news” event when the stock has rallied big into the report. They are a “buy the surprise” event when the stock has been flattish into the report. Where does NVDA find itself today? Well, the stock has rallied 33% since the last earnings report. That puts NVDA stock in the ballpark of where it was prior to the August 2017 and February 2017 reports. Prior to the August 2017 report, NVDA stock had run up 35% since the last earnings report. Prior to the February 2017 report, NVDA stock had run up 32% since the prior earnings report. After both the August and February 2017 reports, NVDA stock dropped. Consequently, it looks like NVDA earnings are a “sell the news” event this time around. I expect shares to drop in response to the quarterly numbers. My conviction in this is strengthened by looking at how Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stock dropped after its strong quarterly report.

NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) is an interesting player in the Technology space, with a focus on Semiconductor – Specialized. The stock has been active on the tape, currently trading at $207.20, up from yesterday’s close by 0.19%. Given the stock’s recent action, it seemed like a good time to take a closer look at the company’s recent data. Fundamental Analysis No amount of research is complete without a bird’s eye view of the financial data. NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) currently trades with a market capitalization of $120.52 Billion. That value represents a market adjusting for revenues that have been growing by 56.16 % on a quarterly year/year basis as of the company’s last quarterly report. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For NVDA, the company currently has $1.99 Billion of cash on the books, which is offset by $89 Million current liabilities. You can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $1.97 Billion over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to grow in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $0.94 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 66.63% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors. Technical Analysis We’ve taken a serious look at this stock from a fundamental perspective, but the tale of the tape may offer more hints about what lies under the surface. Looking at the stock’s movement on the chart, NVIDIA Corporation recorded a 52-week high of $207.89. It is now trading 0.69% off that level. The stock is trading $181.77 its 50-day moving average by -25.43%. The stock carved out a 52-week low down at $66.57. In recent action, NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) has made a move of +14.56% over the past month, which has come on weak relative transaction volume. Over the trailing year, the stock is underperforming the S&P 500 by 23.3, and it’s gotten there by action that has been more volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. In terms of the mechanics underlying that movement, traders will want to note that the stock is trading on a float of 2.56% with $573.18 Million sitting short, betting on future declines. That suggests something of the likelihood of a short squeeze in shares of NVDA.

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) gained 1.46% in first day of the new month, going up from its prior closing price of $203.84 to $206.81, and has now recorded rally in 5 consecutive sessions. Many in the market will be closely watching whether this winning streak is sustainable or take a temporary pause for the next couple of trading sessions. The stock price went upward in 6 of the last 10 days and has generated 4.58% during the last two weeks. Trading activity decreased by -2.32 million shares, and in total, 10.25 M shares exchanged hands for about $2 120.34 million. It should be noted that increasing price and decreasing volume show lack of interest and this is a warning that something has fundamentally changed. Inside NVDA’s Recent Trend NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) lies in the upper part of a wide and strong rising trend in the short term, and this will normally pose a very good selling opportunity for the short-term trader as reaction back towards the lower part of the trend can be expected. A break-up at the top trend line at $210.08 will firstly indicate a stronger raising rate. Short-term traders are predicted to see a rally of 23.7% over the course of a quarter and, with 90% chance the price will be floating in the range of $231.27 and $259.87 in this timeframe.

     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 NVDA has witnessed its long term and short term MA triggering a buy signal. Many traders watch for short-term averages to cross above long-term averages to signal the beginning of a uptrend. Upon corrections, the price will meet support from the averages between $199.59 and $187.16. A break down through these support points will trigger sell signals. Its pivot point low generated buy signal on Wednesday October 25, 2017, which calls for additional surge until the stock forms a new pivot point high. There was a decrease in volume but the price rose. This is usually not interpreted as a good sign as traders widely believe falling volume should see declining stock. Investors should be watching the price action like a hawk in the coming sessions. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Support And Resistance Levels In case of pullback, the next support the price will capture from accumulated volume will not be far away from current price at $187.55 and $180.11. It seems to be blessed by the accumulated volume as it meets no resistance above current level and favorable trading conditions will help the stock to show strong performance in the coming days.

  Nvidia's stock is rising after the company announced it has partnered with several artificial intelligence companies to expand its efforts to train new AI researchers. Nvidia is up 1.30% to $206.50 on Tuesday after announcing an expansion of its Deep Learning Institute. The company's Deep Learning Institute is an initiative to train as many people as possible in AI programming and research. Nvidia announced a partnership on Tuesday with Booz Allen Hamilton, a government consulting firm, and Deeplearning.ai, an online training company, to broaden its institute's reach. “The world faces an acute shortage of data scientists and developers who are proficient in deep learning, and we’re focused on addressing that need,” Greg Estes, vice president at Nvidia, said in a news release. Nvidia has been working on artificial intelligence for years, and has recently emerged as one of the leading providers of the hardware chips and software platforms used in AI applications. The company's graphics processing units help speed up the training of AI systems while its CUDA software is one of the many platforms helping researchers with the development of their AI programs. Nvidia has fostered a positive relationship with some of the most prominent AI researchers in the field, and sees its Deep Learning Institute as a way to start similar relationships with the next generation of AI researchers.

Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) continues its red-hot performance. NVDA stock is one of the biggest winners on the Nasdaq for 2017. Shares are up 171% over the past year, and 83% 2017 year-to-date alone. Anyone skeptical of NVDA stock, including this author on occasion, has looked rather foolish. However, stock price isn’t always tied to business performance. In the case of NVDA stock, investors have bid it up far in excess of any reasonable valuation given the current balance of risk and reward. For NVDA stock to continue producing sizzling returns, just about everything has to go right for the company. The phrase “priced for perfection” was invented for situations like the one we see with Nvidia today. The story with NVDA stock starts at its frenetic earnings growth in recent quarters. Bulls can point to NVDA earnings with pride, it’s been one of the best stories of the year so far. The company has grown earnings by a rather astounding 137% over the past year. For the first half of 2017, compared to 2016, revenue climbed 53%, free cash flow generation by 17%, and net income by 125%. Those are amazing numbers, though net income and earnings are clearly running ahead of actual sales and cash flow, powered by improving margins and mix. All five of Nvidia’s product categories showed year-over-year growth. Only professional visualization came in under 10% growth; the other four segments all grew by at least 20%. Assuming full-year 2017 estimates are achieved, auto revenues will be up almost 5x since 2014, data center up 4x, and gaming up almost 3x. That’s some pretty heady stuff. Unfortunately, Nvidia’s growth rate is set for a serious slowdown. Analyst consensus has earnings rising from 3.49 over the past 12 months to just 4.02 next year. The company is heading for less than 20% growth next year, and analysts peg the five-year compounded growth rate going forward at just 13%. That’d put earnings in 2022 around seven bucks a share, which is nowhere near enough to justify a $200 stock price today. Sure, you can say, analysts are probably sandbagging. Nvidia tends to beat guidance when reporting quarterly results. But even assuming they beat guidance comfortably, it’s still hard to justify anything close to the current price. Given the relatively slow rate of EPS growth for the current year, the P/E ratio will barely budge. NVDA stock is at 56x PE now and is expected to fall to just 49x in 2018. Why is earnings growth slowing down so dramatically? Here’s some real NVDA news that many folks tend to gloss over. It’s worth remembering that Nvidia generates close to 70% of its revenues from gaming and professional visualization. The gaming division has benefited from the launch of a bunch of new cards. That pulled forward demand, but don’t expect that sales momentum to continue let alone accelerate. And Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) will almost certainly hit back with new graphics cards launches of their own to try to take back share from Nvidia. Nvidia has also profited from card sales due to the boom in Bitcoin, Ethereum and other such cryptocurrencies. However, logic dictates these markets will slow down sooner or later. Already, as part of AMD’s earnings miss recently, they conceded that mining card demand is “leveling off.” That as cryptocoins continue to soar. What happens to this source of demand once Bitcoin prices stall out, let alone correct sharply?

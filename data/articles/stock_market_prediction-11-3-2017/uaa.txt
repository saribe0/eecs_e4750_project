 Eighth-ranked Western Washington ended UAA's winning streak at six by beating the Seawolves in four sets Thursday night in Bellingham, Washington.  Abby Phelps and Joellee Buckner racked up double-doubles to lead the Vikings to their 13th win in a row 25-13, 25-21, 23-25, 25-20.  Phelps had 19 kills and 25 digs and Buckner had 15 kills and 28 digs to keep Western Washington atop the Great Northwest Athletic Conference standings with a 14-1 record (20-3 overall). UAA (16-8, 11-4) slipped from third place to fourth place.  The Vikings have lost three sets during their current winning streak. After dropping a set to the Seawolves, they trailed 14-12 in the fourth set before taking control with a 10-2 run.  "Defensively I thought we did OK, (but) we offensively just couldn't get on track," UAA coach Chris Green said by cellphone. "Games 3 and 4 offensively we did get better, it just wasn't quick enough. We played better as the match went along."  Outside hitters Leah Swiss and Chrisalyn Johnson continued to shine for the Seawolves. Swiss tallied 17 kills, 15 digs and three block assists, and Johnson recorded 14 kills and 22 digs.  Keala Kaio-Perez came up with a career-high 36 digs, Casey Davenport had 20 digs to go with 41 assists and Taylor Noga added 18 digs for the Seawolves.  UAA middle blockers Tara Melton and Vanessa Hayes each finished with three block assists and Melton added one solo block, but the Seawolves were outblocked 13-7. Michaela Hall led that effort for the Vikings with eight blocks, two of them solo efforts.  UAA remains on the road for a Saturday match at Simon Fraser. The Seawolves will play their final four GNAC matches at home.

 After leading by as few as three points late in the first half, the No. 4 UAA women's basketball team exploded for a 50-point victory in its season-opening game Thursday against Johnson & Wales in Charlotte, North Carolina.  Ten Seawolves scored and UAA allowed 14 second-half points in the 95-45 win over the Wildcats, who are members of the U.S. Collegiate Athletic Association.  Newcomer Rodericka Ware, a senior guard, led UAA with 21 points and veteran Hannah Wandersee, a junior forward, filled out the stat sheet with 14 points, nine rebounds, four blocks and four steals.  In the first half, the Seawolves were plagued by 17 fouls and 14 turnovers that forced them to abandon their full-court press.  "It was a lot closer than what it needed to be in the first half," UAA coach Ryan McCarthy said. "We were beating ourselves."  The Seawolves led 32-29 with just more than two minutes left in the second quarter, but they built their lead to 41-30 at halftime and led 54-34 midway through the third quarter.  Senior forward Shelby Cloninger provided 16 points and junior guard Sydni Stallworth scored 14 to round out UAA's double-digit scorers.  UAA shot 51.5 percent from the field and all four double-digit scorers shot 50 percent or better. Johnson & Wales shot 24.4 percent and scored nearly half its points from the free throw line.  The Seawolves will take a couple of steps up in competition Sunday when they complete their East Coast road trip with an exhibition game against Division I juggernaut Duke in Durham, North Carolina.  The 12th-ranked Blue Devils feature two WNBA prospects in guards Lexi Brown and Rebecca Greenwell and they have seven players as tall or taller than Wandersee, UAA's tallest player at 6-foot-2.  McCarthy said the Seawolves' goal going into the game is to try to take away as many possessions as possible from Duke and to relish playing on one of college basketball's biggest stages at Cameron Indoor Stadium.  "Duke's been awesome," McCarthy said. "We've already got to practice at Cameron Indoor and tomorrow we'll practice at their practice facility there in Durham.  "This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. We're just excited and feel real fortunate that we get to play a game in Cameron."

The stock has been active on the tape, currently trading at $12.52, down from yesterday’s close by -23.71%.

For UAA, the company currently has $165.69 Million of cash on the books, which is offset by $177 Million current liabilities. You can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $91.46 Million over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to grow in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $0.19 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 30.62% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors.

Under Armour Inc (NYSE:UAA) stock was hit hard on Tuesday following a guidance cut in its most recent earnings report. In its earnings report for the third quarter of 2017, Under Armour Inc  cut its outlook for the full year. This includes dropping its earnings per share expectations to between 18 cents and 20 cents. This is far below Wall Street’s earnings per share estimate of 37 cents for the quarter and was a blow to UAA stock. Under Armour Inc also says that it is expecting its revenue for the full year of 2017 to be up in the low single-digit percentage range. The company reported revenue of $4.83 billion in 2016. Analysts are looking for it to report revenue of $5.22 billion for the year, which is an 8% increase from 2016 revenue. The update to Under Armour Inc’s guidance for the year also includes its gross margin dropping 220 basis points when compared to the 46.4% reported in 2016. It is also expecting operating income to range from nothing to $10 million in 2017. Under Armour Inc’s update to its outlook comes alongside one for its current restructuring plan. The company says that it expects to suffer between $140 million to $150 million in pretax charges connected to this effort. The plan was previously only going to include pretax charges ranging from $110 million to $130 million. UA stock also didn’t get any help from its revenue of $1.41 billion for the third quarter of the year. This is down from its revenue of $1.47 billion from the same time last year. It also didn’t meet Wall Street’s revenue estimate of $1.48 billion for the quarter. Under Armour Inc attributes this to weak sales in North America. UAA stock was down 17% as of noon Tuesday and is down 53% year-to-date. As of this writing, William White did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

This past weekend, the Maroon volleyball team competed in Aurora University’s Jim Coleman Memorial Tournament and went 3–1 overall, defeating University of Dubuque, Concordia University Chicago, and North Park University, but coming up short to Aurora University.  Although the squad lost an important match to Aurora, they are proud of their weekend performance overall and are excited for what is to come in the University Athletic Association (UAA) Championship this weekend.  In response to last weekend, second-year libero Anne Marie Stifter said, “We really learned a lot about ourselves this past weekend and how playing our style of volleyball really makes a difference. Obviously, we would have liked to win all of our games, but we learned from our loss to Aurora and will work this week in practice to prepare for UAA’s this weekend.” The Maroons do not have much time to reflect, as they are looking ahead to this weekend and preparing for the UAA Championship tournament. On Friday, the squad will travel to Atlanta to compete in the tournament hosted by Emory University. They will first take on Rochester in the quarterfinals at 2 pm ET. The Maroons last played the University of Rochester Yellow Jackets in September at the first round of the UAA Round Robin, where they dominated them, reigning victorious in three consecutive sets. But even so, the squad is taking them lightly. To prepare for the big weekend, the Maroons are focusing on themselves, both mentally and physically. Honing their individual skills and concentrating on control and focus is the priority.  “For this weekend at UAA’s, we are really focusing on how we play and not letting the other team dictate the pace of the game,” added Stifter. “We want to be in control during our matches. UAA’s are always super competitive and highly emotional, especially this year because we want to show how good we are and can be when we play our best. Our plan is to stay focused and in control.”  First-year setter Emma Griffith echoed her teammate’s sentiments, saying, “This week we are working a lot on our routines to try to lessen the extra nerves we might have this weekend”. “We went back to the basics and focused on improving everything that has been working well for these past few months, just a little bit more.”  After taking on Rochester in the Quarterfinals on Friday, if they win, they will continue to the semifinals and challenge the winner of Washington University and New York University.  With the fate of their season, and a bid to the national tournament on the line, the Chicago volleyball squad has an exciting and important weekend ahead of them.

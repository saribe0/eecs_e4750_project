Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE: WMT) is inviting everyone to one of its 20,000 parties at any of its 4,700 stores, Fortune reported. Walmart, looking to gain an advantage over its rival department stores during the holiday season, will host parties in its stores. The first party will take place on November 4 and focus on toys and then an entertainment-themed party will take place on Dec. 2, and finally on Dec. 16, the theme will focus on popular gifts. To accommodate what is expected to be a jump in foot traffic, Walmart will add staff to speed up checkout and help retrieve online orders, Fortune wrote. Some workers, dubbed "Holiday Helpers," will be wearing reindeer hats. Santa Claus will be present at some of the events and will give kids the opportunity to play with some of the most wanted toys this holiday season. In fact, Walmart will be looking to take advantage of a weakened Toys R Us and triple its assortment of toys for the holiday season, Adage separately reported. One of the hottest toys, Fingerlings, are selling out as fast as they are stocked in shelves in many stores. "Fingerlings is hot, and remains hot, and I think our toy team did a good job of jumping on it first," Adage quoted chief merchandising officer Steve Bratspies as saying in a media call. "I think we've got a pretty good supply laid in for the season." Finally, the department store is also counting on 2016's hot sellers, such as an exclusive Disney Princess Carriage, to sell just as well, if not better, this year.

After staying quite for a long time Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) shares have recently been behaving interestingly to keep investors awake. Analysts often use price and volume data to predict future stock performance. In the case of WMT, the chart has some interesting things to say about where the stock might be headed. How has the stock performed recently? Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) in the last month has increased +10.21%. Shares are now up over the past year, outperforming the broad market by -100% and outperformed a peer group of similar companies by 216%. After the latest session, which saw the stock close at a price of $87.31, WMT sits below its 52-week high. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has been trading in a bullish manner, based on the relative positions of the stock’s 20 and 200 day moving averages. Momentum indicators 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that WMT may be headed in the future. Fortunately, there is way to use the speed and magnitude of these price changes to predict future performance, thanks to what are known as momentum indicators. As momentum slows, it might be a sign that a support or resistance level has been reached, and that a trend is about to reverse. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for WMT is 65.05%, which suggests that the stock is not particularly expensive or cheap, and not predisposed to a reactive price movement based on this measure. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 85.15%, tells a different story, and suggests that WMT currently trades in overbought territory. What do the trading volumes reveal? Price isn’t the only tool analysts use to forecast future performance. Volume patterns can also reveal some important insights. If, for instance, a stock’s volumes suddenly increase by a significant amount, it’s usually a sign that the level of conviction behind the trade is high. Investors may feel very strongly about the future direction of the stock in question. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) average trading volume of 9,156,410 during the past month is 4.34% above its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been more active than usual in the stock in recent times. What do the analysts think? WMT is currently overvalued by 0.43% relative to the average 1-year price target of $86.94 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 2.40, which implies that analysts are generally neutral in their outlook for WMT over the next year. How risky is the stock?  Absolute price performance isn’t the only thing analysts consider when predicting future performance: volatility matters as well. Beta, which measures the stock’s volatility relative to the overall market, is a simple but effective metric for assessing risk. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has a beta of 0.34, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are less extreme than the market as a whole. WMT therefore has a below average level of market risk. During the past couple of weeks, WMT average daily volatility was 12.10%, which is 2.9 percentage points lower than the average volatility over the past 100 days.

https://stocknewsgazette.com/2017/11/02/dissecting-the-numbers-for-wal-mart-stores-inc-wmt-and-dollar-general-corporation-dg/

Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) shares are up more than 27.23% this year and recently increased 0.72% or $0.63 to settle at $87.94. Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG), on the other hand, is up 9.67% year to date as of 11/01/2017. It currently trades at $81.23 and has returned -3.26% during the past week. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) are the two most active stocks in the Discount, Variety Stores industry based on today’s trading volumes. Investor interest in the two stocks is clearly very high, but which is the better investment? To answer this question, we will compare the two companies across growth, profitability, risk, and valuation metrics, and also examine their analyst ratings and insider activity trends. Growth Companies that can increase earnings at a high compound rate over time are attractive to investors. Analysts expect WMT to grow earnings at a 6.66% annual rate over the next 5 years. Comparatively, DG is expected to grow at a 7.80% annual rate. All else equal, DG’s higher growth rate would imply a greater potential for capital appreciation. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Profitability and Returns Just, if not more, important than the growth rate is the quality of that growth. Growth can actual be harmful to investors if it comes at the cost of weak profitability and low returns. To adjust for differences in capital structure we’ll use EBITDA margin and Return on Investment (ROI) as measures of profitability and return., compared to an EBITDA margin of 10.66% for Dollar General Corporation (DG). WMT’s ROI is 13.40% while DG has a ROI of 15.70%. The interpretation is that DG’s business generates a higher return on investment than WMT’s. Cash Flow  
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Earnings don’t always accurately reflect the amount of cash that a company brings in. WMT’s free cash flow (“FCF”) per share for the trailing twelve months was +0.66. Comparatively, DG’s free cash flow per share was +0.12. On a percent-of-sales basis, WMT’s free cash flow was 0.41% while DG converted 0.15% of its revenues into cash flow. This means that, for a given level of sales, WMT is able to generate more free cash flow for investors. Liquidity and Financial Risk Balance sheet risk is one of the biggest factors to consider before investing. WMT has a current ratio of 0.80 compared to 1.40 for DG. This means that DG can more easily cover its most immediate liabilities over the next twelve months. WMT’s debt-to-equity ratio is 0.62 versus a D/E of 0.54 for DG. WMT is therefore the more solvent of the two companies, and has lower financial risk. Valuation WMT trades at a forward P/E of 19.00, a P/B of 3.46, and a P/S of 0.54, compared to a forward P/E of 16.34, a P/B of 3.91, and a P/S of 0.99 for DG. Given that earnings are what matter most to investors, analysts tend to place a greater weight on the P/E. Analyst Price Targets and Opinions A cheap stock isn’t a good investment if the stock is priced accurately. To get a sense of “value” we must compare the current price to some measure of intrinsic value such as a price target. WMT is currently priced at a 1.15% to its one-year price target of 86.94. Comparatively, DG is -1.6% relative to its price target of 82.55. This suggests that DG is the better investment over the next year. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 2.40 for WMT and 2.40 for DG, which implies that analysts are equally bullish on their outlook for the two stocks. Risk and Volatility To gauge the market risk of a particular stock, investors use beta. Stocks with a beta above 1 are more volatile than the market as a whole. Conversely, a beta below 1 implies below average systematic risk. WMT has a beta of 0.34 and DG’s beta is 0.94. WMT’s shares are therefore the less volatile of the two stocks. Insider Activity and Investor Sentiment Analysts often look at short interest, or the percentage of a company’s float currently being shorted by investors, to aid in their outlook for a particular stock. WMT has a short ratio of 5.71 compared to a short interest of 5.76 for DG. This implies that the market is currently less bearish on the outlook for WMT. Summary Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) beats Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) on a total of 7 of the 14 factors compared between the two stocks. DG has higher cash flow per share, is more profitable, generates a higher return on investment, higher liquidity and has lower financial risk. DG is more undervalued relative to its price target. Finally, DLTR has better sentiment signals based on short interest.

Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) trades at $87.94 having a market capitalization of $264.04 billion. WMT stock price climbed 26.9% over the past year, yielding a positive weighted alpha of 31.1 percent. Since an alpha above 1 hints at more gains, investors can predict some further rally scope.  Weighted Alpha is used to calculate how much a share has gone up or down over a certain period, normally a year. In general, more thrust is placed on most recent actions by assigning higher weights to it than those assigned to past movements. This assists to give a return figure that has a stronger focus on the most current period and is thus a better measure for short-term analysis. This technique is highly famous among technical analysts. If the stock is up it will have a positively weighted alpha. If the stock price is unchanged its weighted alpha will be smaller. A stock price loss will yield a negatively weighted alpha.  Support is likely to come between $87.16 a share to $86.38 a share level. However, if the WMT shares go below $86.38 then it would indicate a much weaker market for the company. In that case, its shares would mark a 1.77% decline from the most recent price. The typical day in the last two weeks has seen about a 1.41% volatility. The average volume for Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has been 8.68 million shares per day over the past 30 days. WMT has a 1-week performance of -0.61%. WMT price is down nearly -1.33% from its 52-week high price of $89.11 a share but is up about 25.77% from its 52-week low price of $65.28 a share.  V.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC) has seen its price went down by -0.61% over the course of one week. It seems that V.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC) might see muted action given an ABR of 2.4 or Hold rating. Analysts, on average, seem bullish as they suggest VFC is worth $2.47 more, giving a target price of $72.62 a share. WMT share have rallied by 27.23% in percentage terms since the start of the year – and added 11.01% in the last month. Volume in the last session has increased compared with WMT’s average trading volume. We think the increased volume is representative of buyers as it has displayed in many other cases.  VFC’s Stochastic Oscillator (%D) is at 75.44%. Values of %D line that are above 80 indicate that the security is overbought; prices could well fall in the near future. And the values below 20 that it is oversold indicate prices could very well bounce upwards. The Stochastic Oscillator is a powerful technical tool that is somewhat surprisingly easy to understand. In a basic sense, it is used by technicians to measure the speed or momentum of the price movement. It represents the location of the previous close relative to the price range over a set number of periods. This can be more easily understood, however, by pulling apart the two lines on the stochastic oscillator and explaining the simple underlying mathematical formulas. The first line is called the %K line, which analyzes the actual price movements in the shares and can be defined as: %K = (Current Close – Lowest Low)/(Highest High – Lowest Low) * 100. The second line, the %D line is simple a 3-day moving average of the %K line. There are three primary ways to read the Stochastic Oscillator in search of entry points, but traders should follow the %D line closely because that indicates major trends on the chart.  V.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC)’s latest quote $70.15 $0.63 0.72% will find technical support in $69.29 a share and a breakdown below this region would be a significantly bearish signal for V.F. Corporation traders. Any way you dice it, a dip below $68.42 a share would be very bad news for VFC’s technical picture in the near-term. The $68.42 level represents at least another 2.47% downside for the stock from its current price. If V.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC) shares can stay above the price resistance around $70.71 a share, that could help propel V.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC) higher to the next line of resistance at $71.26 a share. The typical day in the last one month has seen about a 1.63% volatility. VFC is down around 31.5% from its 12-month high of $48.05 notched on Feb 08, 2017 but is -27.03% above its highest point the past 12 months of $89.11 a share.

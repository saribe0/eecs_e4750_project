 HPQ GRPN AAPL ATVI  Per Steven Milunovich, an analyst with UBS, Apple Inc’s (AAPL  -  Free Report)	 iPhone unit sales in 2018 could be lower than expected, given the “flat” buying intent in many countries, reports Investor’s Business Daily. However, revenues are likely to be cushioned by higher average selling price of premium iPhone models (iPhone X). Subsequently, he slashed his iPhone unit sales growth estimate to 10% from 12% projected earlier. However, he has retained the “Buy” rating on the stock. Investor’s Business Daily quoted the analyst saying, “Phone buying intent vs. a year ago for the next 12 months is flat in the U.S. and Japan and down in the U.K., China and Germany. If the survey is correct regarding more muted near-term unit growth, the Apple narrative could shift toward monetizing the large iPhone base." Apple Inc. Revenue (TTM)   Apple Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Apple Inc. Quote There has been tremendous excitement surrounding iPhone X. It is widely considered to be a super cycle. The sale of this edition is expected to be boosted xby features like a glass body, a dual curved edge-to-edge OLED (organic light-emitting diode) display with wireless charging (USB-C), higher storage options and a far superior camera. There are also speculations that robust iPhone X sales will make Apple the first company to touch the $1 trillion valuation mark. Currently, Apple’s market cap is nearly $894 billion. Its shares have increased about 50.3% year over year and hit a 52-week high of $176.24. Shares are currently trading at $174.09. Per a recent report by GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives, as quoted by Investor’s Business Daily, iPhone X cycle could help Apple reach the milestone figure as early as next year. Apart from iPhone X, the analyst adds that the fast booming Services business and the rebound witnessed in China could propel Apple to new highs. A cash pile of $250 billion could help Apple make strategic acquisitions (Netflix, Walt Disney,Tesla and the rumors go on) and carry on with its gigantic shareholder return plan.  iPhone continues to be the mainstay of Apple’s revenues. The revolutionary iPhone, released in June 2007, changed the world forever and catapulted Apple to new highs. The success of iPhone over the last decade is well chronicled. Reportedly, Apple has sold over 1.2 billion iPhones across the globe, earning over $760 billion in revenues. Since the first iPhone release, Apple shares have skyrocketed compared with the industry to which it belongs. Over the last decade, Apple stock has returned 898.6% while the industry witnessed a rally of 424.9%. At present, Apple carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

It’s a well-documented fact that the AAPL stock multiple rises and falls with each iPhone cycle, depending on whether it was weak, strong, or one of those so-called “supercycles” we’ve been hearing so much about this year. Leading up to the iPhone X release, Wall Street was whipped into a frenzy as analysts raved about the “supercycle” that would ensue, but now, the dust is starting to clear. Analysts are trying to get a sense of where AAPL stock will go next, and not all of the projections are good, despite the fact that the all-hallowed iPhone X is now in the hands of some consumers. There’s little doubt that AAPL stock is in for a bumpy ride, but just how rough might things get? Nomura Instinet analyst Jeffrey Kvaal warns that the AAPL stock multiple might contract so much that the shares could plummet to $130 per share. The stock currently trades above $170 per share, and it hasn’t touched $130 since early this year. However, many people may have missed this forecast because it wasn’t mentioned in the first couple of pages. Talk about burying the lede. Kvaal remains as bullish on AAPL stock as ever, despite his warning that the multiple could contract significantly after the iPhone X cycle. He noted that the AAPL stock multiple has run in cycles since 2010, expanding ahead of a major redesign, such as the iPhone 6 in 2014 and the iPhone X and iPhone 8 this year. After expanding before the redesign, the multiple typically contracts the following year. According to Kvaal, the AAPL stock multiple contracted after the iPhone 6 cycle in the 6s cycle the following year due to “lower off-cycle demand and upgrades.” He added that currently, the multiple is around 14.5 times, but over its cycles of expansion and contraction, it has averaged 12.4 times since 2010, with the bottom end of the range at 8 times and the top end at 15 times. In other words, the AAPL stock multiple is currently near its historic top, which can’t bode well for the shares in the near term. The Nomura Instinet analyst believes that the expansion of the AAPL stock multiple is “likely in the later innings,” meaning that the shares could be about to fall off a cliff. Kvaal warned that the contraction in the AAPL stock multiple “could be meaningful,” as the P/E has averaged 9 times after a supercycle. He also added that every point the multiple contracts is equivalent to about $12 or 7% downside in AAPL stock. In this case, he pegs downside in the stock at $130 after the iPhone 8/X cycle, which would be a P/E multiple of 10 times his calendar 2019 earnings per share estimate. Of course, the multiple is only one part of a stock price, with earnings being the other key part of P/E multiples, in this case. Kvaal sees earnings per share upside in the December quarter and into fiscal 2018 and later. He also notes that tax reform and/ or cash repatriation will have an impact, if either event ever happens. His price target on AAPL stock is $185, which is a multiple of 13.1 times his upside estimate for Apple’s fiscal 2019 earnings per share but 15.4 times the consensus earnings estimate for fiscal 2019. Applying the current multiple of 14.5 times to his upside earnings per share estimate would put AAPL stock at $205 per share. For those who see Apple strictly as a long-term investment and not a trading stock, a plunge to $130 might not seem like a big deal because they’re assuming that the shares will recover. However, buying any stock is a gamble, even one like Apple. On the other hand, should the shares fall as low as Kvaal is predicting or even lower, you can bet that there will be plenty of takers just waiting to scoop up more stock on the pullback. Of course, things could look very different a year from now. It all depends on what Apple does next, whether it’s able to monetize its user base more fully, if it enters a new product category, etc. AAPL stock slipped in intraday trading on Tuesday, falling by as much as 0.7% to $172.88.

 Whatever service or product the company is offering, we are all affected by commodity prices more often than we know. Coffee, oranges, cotton, and beef are all traded on the markets and can dictate how much you are going to pay at the store. Now let us take a look at Apple Inc., ticker AAPL, which operates in the Consumer Goods, and if you see it from a different set of glasses and look at the other aspects of the business you will notice a lot of things. Without further due let’s take a look below on the numerous other functions necessary for investment decisions.   Now, since Apple Inc. is heavily affected by something outside of their control, potentially, you want to ensure Apple Inc. is in good health. The current price of Apple Inc. is 173.07, with the 200 day simple moving average at 13.86%.   First you may want to take a look at the current debt to equity, which is 0.86, as this can give you a glance at the company’s well being regarding debt. The long term debt to equity number currently sits at . Going deeper, Apple Inc.’s profit margin is 21.10%, indicating how much money the company earns per dollar of revenue earned. Gross margin is 38.50% and operating margin is . Fundamental health is key when investing in an industry that has the potential to be slightly more volatile than average.   Take a broader look now, Apple Inc.’s performance year to date is 49.43%, giving you a current mood of this particular equity. Volatility this month is 1.37%, which compared to the average volume of 27902.73 can give you an idea of the movements of the company’s stock. The current target price is $187.74, which can give you an idea of where the stock may want to head in the future. However, this is dependent upon Apple Inc.’s ability to maintain their financial health.   Looking forward with a company that is sensitive to commodity prices can be difficult to predict, but it is still worth trying to figure. The current P/E ratio for AAPL is 18.84 and the forward looking P/E is 14.32. The earnings per share growth this is year has been 10.80% and is predicted to be 10.70% over the next five years. Be sure that your portfolio can handle these projected numbers because the last thing you want to do is compromise your current holdings.   To round out your research, the current dividend yield is 1.46% with a payout ratio of 26.00%. Return on equity comes in at 36.30% and this should help to point you in the right direction. Moreover, Apple Inc. may not help your current situation, but now that you have a better understanding, you will know when to act if the time comes. Do not let the Consumer Goods sector scare you, but rather open your eyes to a whole new world of possibilities. Greater risk does typically mean greater reward, but you want to limit company specific risk while also being exposed to your desired industry. Decide if Apple Inc. is a good fit for yourself and be sure to keep an open mind on everything. Tags (NASDAQ:AAPL) AAPL Apple Inc.

Analytical Significance of Simple Moving Average The SMA200 of the stock is at 13.89%, SMA20 is 0.59%, while SMA50 is 6.57%. AAPL’s relative volume is 1.00. Relative volume is a great indicator to keep a close eye on, but like most indicators it works best in conjunction with other indicators and on different time frames. Higher relative volume you will have more liquidity in the stock which will tighten spreads and allow you to trade with more size without a ton of slippage. AAPL’s overall volume in the last trading session was 10,524,813 shares. Important Technical Indicators to keep in Focus:- A statistical measure of the dispersion of returns (volatility) for AAPL producing salvation in Investors mouth, it has week volatility of 0.98% and for the month booked as 1.43%. Regardless of which metric you utilize, a firm understanding of the concept of volatility and how it is measured is essential to successful investing. A stock that maintains a relatively stable price has low volatility. When investing in a volatile security, the risk of success is increased just as much as the risk of failure.  Apple Inc.’s beta is 1.21 whilst the stock has an average true range (ATR) of 2.48. Other technical indicators are worth considering in assessing the prospects for EQT. RSI for instance is currently at 61.12. It is common practice for investors to use the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio or price multiple) to determine if a company’s stock price is over or undervalued. Companies with a high P/E ratio are typically growth stocks. However, their relatively high multiples do not necessarily mean their stocks are overpriced and not good buys for the long term. The PEG ratio shows us that, when compare to the beer company, the always-popular tech company doesn’t have the growth rate to justify its higher P/E, and its stock price appears overvalued. Apple Inc.’s currently has a PEG ratio of 1.77 where as its P/E ratio is 18.95. The company P/S (price to Sales) ratio is 3.90, P/B (price to Book) ratio is 6.69, while its P/C (price to Cash) ratio stands at 12.05. Should You Go With High Insider Ownership? Many value investors look for stocks with a high percent of insider ownership, under the theory that when management are shareholders, they will act in its own self interest, and create shareholder value in the long-term. This aligns the interests of shareholders with management, thus benefiting everyone. While this sounds great in theory, high insider ownership can actually lead to the opposite result, a management team that is unaccountable because they can keep their jobs under almost any circumstance. Currently Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s shares owned by insiders are 0.08%, whereas shares owned by institutional owners are 61.70%. November 30, 2017 November 30, 2017 November 30, 2017

        Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) files a countersuit against Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) alleging patent infringement and seeks unspecified damages.                Apple says Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 800 and 820 processors, found in Android phones from Samsung and Alphabet, infringe on battery life patents owned by Apple.                 The infringement claims appear in Apple’s revised response to Qualcomm’s suit accusing Apple of infringement.                 The long legal fight between the companies led to Apple no longer making royalty payments, which has hurt Qualcomm financially and made that company more vulnerable to Broadcom’s potential hostile takeover.  Apple shares are down 0.10% premarket.  Qualcomm shares are down 0.54%.   Previously: Stifel downgrades Qualcomm, raises its price target (Nov. 29) See all stocks on the move »

Applied Materials (AMAT) is trading sharply lower today, so we looked back at what we wrote two weeks ago. At that juncture in the market, we said, "AMAT might close lower today after making a new high of $60.89. This might turn out to be a key reversal day, but it probably will not be the end of the bull story as the charts do not show a distribution or topping pattern. I would look for AMAT to trade sideways for a number of weeks." With some hindsight, we can see the high at $60.89 on Nov. 17 has remained the high. Today AMAT is trading below its nearby support level at $55. Normally the breaking of a nearby support level is not that crucial in as strong a bull market as we have been witnessing, but AMAT is also trading below its 50-day moving average line. AMAT traded below that line for much of August, but the rest of our favorite indicators were in better shape at that point in time.   In this updated daily bar chart, above, we can see AMAT is below the rising 50-day line and the next likely area of support (previous area of resistance) is the $48-$47 area -- the highs of June, July and September. The rising 200-day moving average line is still well below the market, around $45. In the past six weeks or so, the On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has been flat, telling us that buyers and sellers of AMAT were in balance. The price weakness today could mean the OBV line turns down. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator crossed to the downside in late October, generating a take-profits sell signal. The MACD oscillator is still pointed down in a bearish mode.   In this weekly bar chart of AMAT, above, only one indicator has deteriorated in the past two weeks. Prices are still above the rising 40-week moving average line. The weekly OBV line is still constructive. The MACD oscillator, however, has narrowed. In the next few weeks we may or may not see a bearish crossover of the two moving averages that comprise this indicator, but the histogram (the distance between the two averages) has already peaked.   In this Point and Figure chart of AMAT, above, we can see a column of O's to the downside. Prices have met a downside price target of $53.82, but we don't have a lot of reason to anticipate support nearby. The best area for support is in the mid-$40s, where there is heavy volume (the left side of the chart). Bottom line: Selloffs in the "hot" technology sector in the bull market this year have been relatively short and shallow, but the advance is older now than it was in January, so aging has to be considered. Keeping this in mind, we might be seeing the start of a pullback to the $47 area and a new consolidation pattern in the weeks ahead. Keep your powder dry.

Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) is on our radar right now but there could still be some opportunities on the horizon. Now trading with a market value of 61.40B, the company has a mix of catalysts and obstacles that spring from the nature of its operations. Everyone seems to have their own opinion of this stock. But what do the numbers really say? We think it’s a great time to take a fresh look. Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) Fundamentals That Matter It’s generally a good idea to start with the most fundamental piece of the picture: the balance sheet. The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For AMAT, the company currently has 5.01 billion of cash on the books. The trend over time is important to note. In this case, the company’s debt has been growing. The company also has 19.42 billion in total assets, balanced by 10.07 billion in total liabilities, which should give you a sense of the viability of the company under any number of imagined business contexts. Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT) saw 575 million in free cash flow last quarter, representing a quarterly net change in cash of -268 million. Perhaps most importantly where cash movements are concerned, the company saw about 699 million in net operating cash flow.

 Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) Revenue Growth Potential As far as key trends that demonstrate something of the future investment potential of this stock, we need to take a closer look at the top line, first and foremost. Last quarter, the company saw 3.97 billion in total revenues. That represents a quarterly year/year change in revenues of 0.20 in sequential terms, the AMAT saw sales decline by 0.06. But what about the bottom line? After all, that’s what really matters in the end. Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT) is intriguing when broken down to its core data. The cost of selling goods last quarter was 2.18 billion, yielding a gross basic income of 1.79 billion. For shareholders, given the total diluted outstanding shares of 1.08 billion, this means overall earnings per share of 0.91. Note, this compares with a consensus analyst forecast of 0.98 in earnings per share for its next fiscal quarterly report.

For AMAT, the company currently has $5.01 Billion of cash on the books. You can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $3.27 Billion over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to grow in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $0.98 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 82.33% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors. Technical Analysis It’s important to check the technicals to get a sense of how AMAT has been acting. Looking at the stock’s movement on the chart, Applied Materials, Inc. recorded a 52-week high of $60.89. It is now trading 2.98% off that level. The stock is trading $53.80 its 50-day moving average by -4.11%. The stock carved out a 52-week low down at $29.85. In recent action, Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT) has made a move of +3.54% over the past month, which has come on weak relative transaction volume. Over the trailing year, the stock is underperforming the S&P 500 by 17.96, and it’s gotten there by action that has been more volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. In terms of the mechanics underlying that movement, traders will want to note that the stock is trading on a float of 1.01% with $1.06 Billion sitting short, betting on future declines. That suggests something of the likelihood of a short squeeze in shares of AMAT.

Latest evolution in the price of Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) stock has been one of the most talked about matter among the interested investors. Analysts often use price and volume data to predict future stock performance. In the case of AMAT, the chart has some interesting things to say about where the stock might be headed. How has the stock performed recently? Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) in the last month has increased +3.54%. Shares are now up over the past year, outperforming the broad market by -100% and outperformed a peer group of similar companies by 133%. After the latest session, which saw the stock close at a price of $57.91, AMAT sits below its 52-week high. Applied Materials, Inc.

     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that AMAT may be headed in the future. Fortunately, there is way to use the speed and magnitude of these price changes to predict future performance, thanks to what are known as momentum indicators. As momentum slows, it might be a sign that a support or resistance level has been reached, and that a trend is about to reverse. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for AMAT is 60.62%, which suggests that the stock is not particularly expensive or cheap, and not predisposed to a reactive price movement based on this measure. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 48.55%, tells a similar story, and suggests that AMAT currently trades in neutral territory. What do the trading volumes reveal? Analysts use volume trends to assess the level of conviction behind a stock’s price changes. When volumes suddenly increase above normal levels, it can be a sign that investors feel very strongly in one way or the other about the future direction of a stock, or may even have access to inside information. Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT) average trading volume of 9,933,809 during the past month is 0.3% below its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been less active than usual in the stock in recent times. What do the analysts think? AMAT is currently undervalued by -15.14% relative to the average 1-year price target of $68.24 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 1.80, which implies that analysts are generally bullish in their outlook for AMAT over the next year. How risky is the stock?  No study on the valuation of a stock is complete without taking into account risk. When analyzing the systematic risk associated with a stock, analysts look at beta, which measures the stock’s volatility relative to the overall market. Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) has a beta of 1.84, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are more extreme than the market as a whole. AMAT therefore has a above average level of market risk. During the past couple of weeks, AMAT average daily volatility was 28.16%, which is -0.36 percentage points higher than the average volatility over the past 100 days.

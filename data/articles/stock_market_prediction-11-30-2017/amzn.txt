As companies and governments around the world test drone deliveries, turning the slightly unnerving prospect of heavily-loaded unmanned machines flying over your head into an approaching reality, Amazon is preparing for the worst. On Tuesday (Nov. 28), the US Patent and Trademark Office granted Amazon the patent for developing a drone that can self-destruct and disperse its parts safely in the face of an impending crash. Amazon filed the application in June 2016. In a nutshell, the drone is equipped with a “fragmentation controller,” which will determine a dispersal sequence for the machine’s parts based on flight path, terrain, and weather. The controller could kick in, for example, when it’s too windy to keep flying safely, or when temperatures are so high they could affect the drone’s battery. Once the loss of flight operations is detected, the fragmentation controller will step in using different release methods, such as latches and hooks, according to the filings. The controller will direct components towards safe locations, such as over a pond or large tree. The fragmentation controller will also consider how to save costs and reduce damage to payloads when dropping components. Amazon wasn’t immediately available for comment on the next steps with the patent. Patents don’t always result in an actual real-world product and there are regulations in place that circumscribe drone use. In the US, for example, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has set rules that limit weights, operation time, and flying speed for autonomous vehicles. But the company is working closely with the authorities towards its ambition of achieving drone deliveries in populous areas. The e-commerce giant is one of six companies working with NASA and the FAA on developing an air-traffic management system to integrate unmanned drones into the country’s airspace below 400 feet by 2019. Earlier, in October, it obtained a US patent for an idea for flying drones that can power moving cars. The company conducted its first fully autonomous drone delivery in December 2016, dispatching a streaming device and one bag of popcorn to a customer living in the British countryside.

Amazon’s newest product won’t tell you a joke or turn on your lights. The new DeepLens camera is instead custom-built for artificial intelligence developers, who will be able to build AI systems on Amazon Web Services and have them run on the camera, according to the company. This means the camera itself will be able to recognize objects, look for faces, or label what actions people are doing, all without needing to call back to Amazon’s servers. Amazon Web Services has been a financial lifeline for Amazon, which notoriously ekes out the thinnest of profit margins. The cloud services business generated $4.6 billion in revenue in the latest quarter, up 42% from the same period a year earlier. But as mobile processors get cheaper to manufacture, largely due to the smartphone boom, Amazon is anticipating a future in which much of the world’s computing doesn’t happen on large servers, but instead inside the cameras, smartphones, and other electronics scattered across the world that collect data. The DeepLens camera is a nod to developers that says, even if you don’t run your AI on a cloud, Amazon still has the software you’ll want to use. But the camera still has some limitations; it can detect if there are faces in the camera’s sight, but to process who those people are, it will need to call back to an Amazon cloud service that’s already been trained to know specific faces. The camera is available for preorder now, and costs $249.

Mario Tama/Getty Images  Shares of Amazon could reach $1,450 in the next 12 months, Goldman Sachs said in a note to clients Tuesday morning. It’s the highest price target on Wall Street, according to Bloomberg.  "We continue to believe Amazon’s pace of innovation, increasing pricing flexibility, and an aging corporate technology base, will drive the ongoing shift of workloads into the cloud,” analyst Heath Terry said. “We remain Buy-rated (CL) and raise our 12-month price target to $1,450 from $1,300."  The bank’s note comes on the first day of Amazon’s re:INVENT conference, hosted by its Web Services unit, one of its fastest-growing businesses.  "On top of its rapid pace of innovation and its penetration into developers, AWS' product breadth also represents a competitive moat, in our view," the bank said. "With nearly 100 products available across regions, companies would need to combine multiple vendors to compile the list of services offered collectively by AWS."  Goldman’s new price target is the most bullish on Wall Street, according to Bloomberg data — 21% above the stock’s opening price of$1,257 on Tuesday.  Amazon Web Services Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy will give a keynote address at the conference on Wednesday, followed by Chief Technology Officer Werner Vogels on Thursday. Goldman expects those talks to have exciting new product announcements that could boost the stock’s price.  Here’s what the unit has announced at previous conferences via Goldman:  Goldman Sachs Despite Goldman's hopes, however, Jassy hinted on Twitter that Werner’s keynote will be a "deep look at the future of data and serverless," rather than a traditional keynote filled with new product releases.  Twitter You can follow Amazon’s stock price in real-time here — and be sure to follow Business Insider's tech team for updates from the event.  Amazon's stock price is up 58.87% so far this year.  Markets Insider NOW WATCH: Billionaire Alibaba CEO Jack Ma is the star of an ultra-popular kung fu film See Also:

AMZN – Goldman Sachs raises PT to $1450 from $1300. This new price target represents a 21.25% upside over the stock’s previous closing price of $1,195.83. Update: As of Nov. 29, 2017, this bullish analyst call has returned -2.89%. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) shares are getting set for a massive rally from current levels, led by new products and Amazon Web Services (AWS) growth. That’s according to Goldman Sachs analyst Heath Terry, who this morning raised his price target on AMZN to a Street-high $1,450. That’s up from a prior target of $1,300, and implies a 21% upside from current levels. Terry also maintained his Conviction Buy rating on the stock ahead of the company’s annual AWS conference, dubbed “re:Invent,” this week. The analyst noted that product announcements and stock performance during previous conferences suggest that investors might be anticipating a positive impact on AMZN shares stemming from re:Invent, not to mention corresponding volatility in the stocks of companies impacted by Amazon’s announcements. Terry also notes that the number of product announcements made during the annual conference has significantly increased in recent years, with more than 15 announced in 2016 versus less than 10 in each of its first 3 years. While Terry doesn’t expect that many products to be announced this time around, he does see a lot of potential for further partnerships. The analyst speculates that Amazon’s much-publicized HQ2 — its second massive headquarters in search of a major city home in North America — may be all about AWS. “While Amazon has never discussed any plans for a spin or any HQ2 plans relative to AWS, it is possible that the location of the new headquarters could provide some insight into the way management is thinking about the positioning of AWS,” he said. Amazon.com, Inc. shares rose $8.16 (+0.68%) in premarket trading Tuesday. Year-to-date, AMZN has gained 59.47%, versus a 18.08% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period. AMZN currently has a StockNews.com POWR Rating of A (Strong Buy), and is ranked #3 of 50 stocks in the Internet category.

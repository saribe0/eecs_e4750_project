https://investorplace.com/2017/11/bank-of-america-bac-stock-run-up-is-overdone/

Throughout a somewhat volatile 2017 for what is one of the most heavily regulated industries out there, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) has consistently been able to keep its head above water. And post-third-quarter earnings, the market has rewarded shareholders for their patience. Shareholders are no doubt in high spirits as the year comes to a close. In the past three months alone, BAC stock has jumped 12%, pushing year-to-date gains to 21%. This puts its performance well above the overall sector. The rally early in the year for financial stocks — banks, in particular — didn’t make it past the first quarter, but BAC has managed to outperform even the S&P 500, which is up 16%. To my surprise, BAC has also outperformed my favorite company in the sector, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM). I still maintain that JPM is the best run “big bank” in the business, as long as CEO Jamie Dimon is at the helm. Every business segment looks super strong from consumer business to asset management to the investment bank. And this is despite a universally tough year for trading. Perhaps with Warren Buffet’s continued support and investment in BAC as its single largest common shareholder, via Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B), there will always be some edge from a PR standpoint for retail investors. The sector as a whole got a mid-year bump of sorts after banks across the board more than met Basel 3 requirements. That indicates that banks are well-capitalized and balance sheets are strong. But why BAC deserves to trade above the broader industry is difficult for me to discern. Now, given the YTD growth numbers, I’m not blind to the obvious merits. From a  bottom-line standpoint, consumer banking has grown 14%, investment management 10% and global banking 27%. Global markets were down 9% year-over-year but have been a challenge for all banks. But looking at tangible book value per share, which I feel serves as a better barometer for bank performance than normal earnings, performance is lackluster — 1% YOY, just barely eking into positive territory. Loans and leases are up just 2% YOY, compared to average core loans up 7% YOY for JPM. Average total deposits for BAC were up 4% YOY compared to 9% for JPM. One can argue that JPM is operating off a smaller total deposit amount. But ultimately the market will be looking at growth. That growth will inform future earnings which are then discounted back to the present. So, that growth number is still important to compare to peers regardless of what the base amount is.

Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) stock flux has recently been causing stir among the investment community. Analysts often use price and volume data to predict future stock performance.

Shares are now up over the past year, outperforming the broad market by -100% and outperformed a peer group of similar companies by 132%.

 Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that BAC may be headed in the future. If we want to get a sense of BAC’s future performance, we have to look at the speed and size of these price movements. Using what are known as momentum indicators, we can use the stock’s price momentum to get a sense of whether the stock is in the midst of, or nearing the end of, a current trend. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for BAC is 51.47%, which suggests that the stock is not particularly expensive or cheap, and not predisposed to a reactive price movement based on this measure. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 38.21%, tells a similar story, and suggests that BAC currently trades in neutral territory. What do the trading volumes reveal? In addition to price, analysts use volume trends to predict future performance. The level of trading activity in a stock is often a good proxy for the level of interest and enthusiasm for the name within the investment community. A sudden increase in activity can be a sign that investors are trading in anticipation of a catalyst. Bank of America Corporation (BAC) average trading volume of 56,253,004 during the past month is 26.5% below its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been less active than usual in the stock in recent times. What do the analysts think? BAC is currently undervalued by -6.11% relative to the average 1-year price target of $28.32 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 2.10, which implies that analysts are generally neutral in their outlook for BAC over the next year. How risky is the stock?  Absolute price performance isn’t the only thing analysts consider when predicting future performance: volatility matters as well. Beta, which measures the stock’s volatility relative to the overall market, is a simple but effective metric for assessing risk. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) has a beta of 1.32, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are more extreme than the market as a whole. BAC therefore has a above average level of market risk. During the past couple of weeks, BAC average daily volatility was 14.40%, which is 4.08 percentage points lower than the average volatility over the past 100 days.

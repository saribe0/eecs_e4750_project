    Newslook GE earnings dip, missing Wall Street's expectations.(Photo: Gene J. Puskar, AP) General Electric (NYSE: GE) cut its dividend in half in order to save money. The company hasn't been making enough money to cover its dividend recently, and the cut will save GE more than $4 billion per year. GE's free cash flow has declined for six years in a row, so cost-cutting measures had become necessary. There's no way to predict with 100% reliability whether a company will be able to maintain or grow its dividend payments in perpetuity, but there are a few things that can indicate your dividends might be in trouble. The most important dividend-related metric to know is the payout ratio. This is simply a stock's dividend, expressed as a percentage of its earnings. For example, if a stock pays $0.50 in dividends this year and earns $1.00, its payout ratio is 50%. A payout ratio of 60% or less is generally considered healthy, and 100% or more implies that the stock isn't earning enough to pay its dividend. In GE's case, the company was paying out dividends at a rate of $0.96 per year, yet it had only earned $0.86 per share over the past year. This is a payout ratio of 112% and was a clear sign to GE's investors that the dividend might be unsustainable. Other warning signs include declining earnings or free cash flow, a debt load that is rapidly increasing, and a history of previous cuts during a recession. If any of these apply, there's a strong chance that your dividends could be in danger -- especially if the stock has a high payout ratio.

Source: Shutterstock There’s an old saw in stock picking that “if you take care of the downside, the upside will take care of itself.” Unfortunately, that saw doesn’t yet apply to General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) stock. Even though the GE stock price has come down, and even though the stock has stabilized over the past two weeks, the downside isn’t yet taken care of. In fact, GE stock still has to grow into any earnings-based valuation. And it’s downright expensive based on the company’s own cash flow expectations. General Electric isn’t doomed by any means. GE news coming out of its Investor Update on Nov. 13 looked negative to me, as I wrote at the time. But the news isn’t all bad. It was only a few months ago that I admitted to being intrigued by the contrarian case for General Electric. But the problem remains that GE’s valuation is high, not low. Even after an ugly performance this year, the stock price of General Electric still has plenty of potential downside ahead of it. And that colors any efforts to try and time the bottom in the stock. One of the many disappointments in the Investor Update,which sent GE stock down 12% over two sessions, was the company’s guidance for 2018 earnings. GE projects 2018 EPS of $1.00 to $1.07, below consensus (at the time) of $1.14 and implying a modest decline from 2017 figures of $1.05-$1.10. That likely decline will come despite aggressive cost-cutting that should help profits next year. With multi-year turnarounds required in the Power and Healthcare businesses, 2019-2020 growth seems likely to be modest as well. And yet the GE stock price still sits at 17.5x the midpoint of that 2018 guidance. Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE:HON), which has outperformed GE both as a stock and a business, trades at 19.3x forward earnings, with a better near-term growth profile. As such, it seems unlikely that GE’s earnings multiple will expand much, if at all, going forward. Investors can buy HON for a roughly similar valuation. There are similarly challenged companies with better dividends – think International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM), which I like at these levels, or even a company like Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) – available for 11-13x forward earnings.

GE Healthcare, a subsidiary of General Electric Co. (GE), is set to use Nvidia Corp.’s (NVDA) chips in an artificial intelligence (AI) platform to improve the speed and accuracy of CT and ultrasound scans. In a joint statement on Monday, the two companies revealed plans to strengthen their already 10-year long partnership by installing Nvidia's chips in GE Healthcare's Revolution Frontier CT platform and 500,000 imaging devices across the globe. Using Nvidia’s chips, the AI-equipped devices are said to be two times faster than the previous generation image processor and capable of delivering lower radiation doses, faster exam times and higher quality medical imaging. GE Healthcare, one of conglomerate GE’s most profitable areas of business, said the speedier Revolution Frontier technology should help to reduce the number of follow-up appointments and non-interpretable scans as it is better equipped to detect liver and kidney lesions.

Under the terms of the deal, GE Healthcare will also use Nvidia’s graphics processing units, CUDA computing platform and cloud registry to power its new analytics platform. The company said that an average hospital generates 50 petabytes of data annually, but that only 3 percent of that data is analyzed, tagged, or made actionable. "Healthcare is changing at remarkable speed, and the technologies that will transform the industry should reflect that pace," said Kieran Murphy, president and CEO of GE Healthcare. "By partnering with Nvidia, GE Healthcare will be able to deliver devices of the future — intelligent machines capable of empowering providers to improve the speed and accuracy of diagnoses for patients around the world." Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, added: “Our partnership with GE Healthcare brings together great expertise in medical instruments and AI to create a new generation of intelligent instruments that can dramatically improve patient care.” (See also: AI Is NVIDIA's to Lose, Says Jefferies, Upping PT.) GE Healthcare’s use of Nvidia’s chips represents another big coup for the Santa Clara, California-based company. Nvidia’s AI technology has already been introduced across a number of fields, including self-driving cars, robotics and video analytics. These breakthroughs have led the company’s stock to soar over the past year. (See also: Why NVIDIA's Valuation May Be A Giant Bubble.)

Graphics-chip maker Nvidia (NVDA) and GE Healthcare, a unit of General Electric (GE), have announced a partnership to bring artificial intelligence to GE medical imaging devices in use worldwide to speed the processing of health care data. X The companies announced the partnership Sunday at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America, being held in Chicago through Friday. Nvidia shares dropped 1.3% to close at 214.14 on the stock market today. GE stock ticked down 7 cents to 18.12. Nvidia and GE said they plan to bring sophisticated AI to GE Healthcare's 500,000 imaging devices globally. They announced the new Nvidia-powered Revolution Frontier CT scanner, advancements to the Vivid E95 4D Ultrasound and development of GE Healthcare's Applied Intelligence analytics platform. The new CT (computed tomography) system in GE's Revolution product family is two times faster in image processing than its predecessor, due to its use of Nvidia's AI computing platform, the companies said in a news release. It is expected to deliver better clinical outcomes in liver lesion detection and kidney lesion characterization because of its speed, Nvidia and GE said. "Our partnership with GE Healthcare brings together great expertise in medical instruments and AI to create a new generation of intelligent instruments that can dramatically improve patient care," Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang said in a statement. IBD'S TAKE: Nvidia currently ranks No. 7 on the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks. GE's Vivid E95 4D Ultrasound System also uses Nvidia graphics processing units to provide fast, accurate visualization and analysis while streamlining workflows, they said. The new GE Healthcare Applied Intelligence platform will use Nvidia GPUs, the Nvidia Cuda parallel computing platform and Nvidia GPU Cloud container registry to accelerate the creation, deployment and use of deep learning algorithms in health care analytic applications. "By partnering with Nvidia, GE Healthcare will be able to deliver devices of the future — intelligent machines capable of empowering providers to improve the speed and accuracy of diagnoses for patients around the world," GE Healthcare CEO Kieran Murphy said in a statement.

Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) shares are up more than 33.93% this year and recently increased 0.05% or $0.01 to settle at $21.83. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), on the other hand, is up 35.71% year to date as of 11/27/2017. It currently trades at $1047.41 and has returned 2.85% during the past week. Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) are the two most active stocks in the Internet Information Providers industry based on today’s trading volumes. Investors are clearly interested in the two names, but is one a better choice than the other? We will compare the two companies across growth, profitability, risk, valuation, and insider trends to answer this question. Growth Companies that can consistently grow earnings at a high compound rate usually have the greatest potential to create value for shareholders in the long-run. Analysts expect TWTR to grow earnings at a 17.70% annual rate over the next 5 years. Comparatively, GOOG is expected to grow at a 20.68% annual rate. All else equal, GOOG’s higher growth rate would imply a greater potential for capital appreciation. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Profitability and Returns Growth doesn’t mean much if it comes at the cost of weak profitability. To adjust for differences in capital structure we’ll use EBITDA margin and Return on Investment (ROI) as measures of profitability and return. , compared to an EBITDA margin of 24.89% for Alphabet Inc. (GOOG). Cash Flow  
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 The amount of free cash flow available to investors is ultimately what determines the value of a stock. TWTR’s free cash flow (“FCF”) per share for the trailing twelve months was +0.28. Comparatively, GOOG’s free cash flow per share was +9.00. On a percent-of-sales basis, TWTR’s free cash flow was 8.21% while GOOG converted 6.93% of its revenues into cash flow. This means that, for a given level of sales, TWTR is able to generate more free cash flow for investors. Valuation TWTR trades at a forward P/E of 48.51, a P/B of 3.33, and a P/S of 6.63, compared to a forward P/E of 25.29, a P/B of 4.89, and a P/S of 7.18 for GOOG. Given that earnings are what matter most to investors, analysts tend to place a greater weight on the P/E. Analyst Price Targets and Opinions Just because a stock is cheaper doesn’t mean there’s more value to be had. In order to assess value we need to compare the current price to where it’s likely to trade in the future. TWTR is currently priced at a 17.37% to its one-year price target of 18.60. Comparatively, GOOG is -4.86% relative to its price target of 1100.86. This suggests that GOOG is the better investment over the next year. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 3.20 for TWTR and 1.60 for GOOG, which implies that analysts are more bullish on the outlook for TWTR. Insider Activity and Investor Sentiment Comparing the number of shares sold short to the float is a method analysts often use to get a reading on investor sentiment. TWTR has a short ratio of 2.49 compared to a short interest of 2.75 for GOOG. This implies that the market is currently less bearish on the outlook for TWTR. Summary Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) beats Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) on a total of 9 of the 14 factors compared between the two stocks.

Connecticut attorney general George Jepsen is questioning Google about the company’s unauthorized tracking of Android users, his office told Quartz. Since the beginning of 2017, Android phones have been collecting the addresses of nearby cell phone towers, and sending them back to parent company Google, even when phones don’t have a SIM card or their “location services” are disabled, Quartz reported on Nov. 21. The practice allowed the company to track where Android users were without their knowledge. “I can confirm that Connecticut is looking into this, but we are unable to comment further at this time,” a spokesperson for Jepsen told Quartz. Jepsen has previously pushed Apple to vet their Apple Watch privacy protections with regulators and blasted Equifax for its data breach. British and South Korean regulators are also questioning Google over the situation, CNN reported earlier. Google never used or stored the information, a company spokesperson told Quartz earlier, and took steps to end the practice after being contacted by Quartz. Google had no immediate comment on the Connecticut probe. Google could also be facing US federal probes as well over the practice. A Federal Communications Commission spokesman told Quartz the situation was a “FTC issue,” referring to the Federal Trade Commission. A FTC spokeswoman said investigations were not public, and that the agency generally does not comment on them. The FTC has been somewhat hobbled under the Trump administration, which is dismantling federal consumer protections, and currently has just two of five commissioners in place. Still, the FTC has recently brought privacy-related cases against Lenovo and made settlements with three companies that lied about participating in the EU-US Privacy Shield framework. Other US states may look into the situation as well. Attorneys general are chief consumer protection officials of their state, and US consumers are concerned about data privacy, said Divonne Smoyer, a partner with Reed Smith who specializes in AG investigations. A spokesperson for Mississippi state attorney general Jim Hood, a dogged and frequent critic of Google, said she couldn’t comment on whether he was probing the unauthorized tracking. Unlike in many other regulatory matters, “it’s not a partisan issue,” Smoyer said, and “Republicans are just active and concerned” as Democrats. While state AGs often work with the FTC on these issues, they don’t wait for the federal agency to act, Smoyer said.

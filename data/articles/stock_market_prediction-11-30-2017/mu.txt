  0 Comments With the current high demand for nurse educators across Australia, those completing their Master of Nursing online with James Cook University can expect a level of job choice and security that is unprecedented in most other fields of work. News of Australia’s severe nursing shortage has been no secret over the last several years. Conflated with the increasing demand on our healthcare system and steadily ageing population, the situation has unfortunately been getting worse. According to the most recent report from Health Workforce, an Australian government initiative, there will be a “projected shortfall of approximately 85,000 nurses by 2025, and 123,000 nurses by 2030 under current settings”. With such alarming numbers, it’s surprising that thousands of qualified would-be nursing students are still being turned away from Australian universities every year. This is mostly due to the even more dire shortage of nursing educators. Without anyone to teach them, it remains impossible to plug the ever-increasing gap in the nursing workforce. The Australian government’s latest job outlook reflects this, predicting “very strong growth” within the nurse educators and research field between now and May 2022. From their report, “there are likely to be between 3,001 and 7,500 job openings over [the next 5 years]”. Albeit not under the greatest of circumstances, this means that there are fantastic career opportunities available for those interested in becoming nurse educators and practitioners.  With such high demand and further growth expected, individuals graduating with their Master of Nursing can expect a level of job choice and security that is unprecedented in most other fields of work. Benefits of becoming a nurse educator Availability of jobs is obviously not the only benefit of working as a nurse educator, nor should it be the only draw card for individuals planning their career paths. In their roles training the bright minds of Australia’s future nurses, nursing educators and practitioners play a crucial role in the much-needed strengthening of our nation’s healthcare sector. An educator’s contribution goes beyond simply preparing students for the workforce, but also continually assessing and critically thinking about ways in which our nation’s healthcare workers can be more efficient, supportive, and, of course, supported. It almost goes without saying just how fulfilling and rewarding playing such a fundamental role in shaping the future of Australia’s nurses can be. Lead your industry into the future Some may worry that stepping out of the hands-on, practical side of nursing may mean they become out of the touch with the industry, but this couldn’t be further from the truth. In fact, educators are most often the first to know about new technologies, methods, breakthroughs and more happening within the medical and healthcare communities. If being on the cutting edge of new information and enjoying the fulfillment of sharing said knowledge isn’t enough, there’s also the benefit of greater flexibility to consider. Educators enjoy a much less demanding work schedule, void of the commonly dreaded overnight work and 12-hour, labour-intensive shifts. Their work environment is a lot less chaotic and stressful, too. A flexible career path Nurse educators can benefit from the job satisfaction of teaching, an attractive salary and even more attractive schedule, being at the forefront of new innovations, and much more, without having to give up their occupation as a nurse or healthcare professional. Not only can you complete your Master of Nursing whilst continuing to work in the field thanks to increasing avenues available to study online, you can also work towards fitting both career paths in your life. Whilst many educators work to provide training within higher educational settings such as universities, some choose to follow the academic route whilst still being on the ground, so to speak. They do this by taking positions as clinical supervisors or similar roles within schools based in hospitals and other healthcare forums. With the academic calendar providing a bit more flexibility, there’s also the possibility to spend part of the year in front of a classroom, and part of the year in scrubs. The future of Australia’s healthcare system unfortunately has a significant strain on it, but more people choosing to pursue an exciting career in nursing education has the potential to lighten this burden significantly. With numerous benefits to be found in this field, hopefully the call for more nurse educators will be met over the coming years. JCU Online offers students the opportunity to complete their Master of Nursing courses through distance education, making it even easier to become a qualified nurse educator or practitioner without having to put an entire career on hold.

After reaching levels not seen since the dot-com boom, Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) shares got hit with selling this week. After closing at $49.14 last Wednesday, MU stock is trading at $43.56 as of this writing — though it is still up 98% for the year. Yet, there are some Wall Street analysts that are getting antsy about the chip industry. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) analyst Shawn Kim noted recently: “Given our view of the cycle, we cannot recommend the sector until the market recognizes mounting pressure on NAND prices and slowing logic chip growth momentum in the near term. … This reflects our negative view of prospects for the global memory industry, which is currently at a peak.” Interestingly enough, another MS analyst, Joseph Moore, did not take this industry view as problematic for MU stock. He raised his price target from $39 to $55. It is understandable that there is considerable uncertainty regarding the chip sector, as many companies have posted strong gains and the industry has a long history of boom-bust cycles. OK then, so what to do with MU stock? Well, for the most part, I still think the bull case is intact. A big part of why I like MU stock is that the global memory business is now left to a handful of players. And they understand how important it is to be disciplined with capacity. Why engage in a price war that benefits no one? Next, MU has undergone much change over the years, as the company has moved away from its dependence on the PC market. The result is that Micron is benefiting from various megatrends, such as mobile, cloud computing, AI (artificial intelligence), the Internet-of-Things (IoT), AR (augmented reality) and VR (virtual reality). All these represent large and fast-growing opportunities, which should help drive revenues at MU. In light of the strengths of MU, it should be no surprise that the company has the support of some of Wall Street’s savviest investors. Based on filings with the SEC, hedge fund manager David Tepper disclosed he boosted his holdings of MU stock from 1.25 million shares to 8.44 million shares. Then there is Bill Joy, who is the co-founder of Sun Microsystems. His own fund has allocated 25% of its equity portfolio to the shares. In a recent letter to shareholders, he wrote: “With the DRAM industry untethered from its highly cyclical past, we believe chip prices and company earnings are going to be and [will] remain higher for longer than investors currently expect.” Next Page Article printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2017/11/micron-technology-mu-stock-megatrends/. ©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC

Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) is an interesting player in the Technology space, with a focus on Semiconductor- Memory Chips. The stock has been active on the tape, currently trading at $48.05, down from yesterday’s close by -3.28%. Given the stock’s recent action, it seemed like a good time to take a closer look at the company’s recent data. Fundamental Analysis Does this stock stack up well when compared to its peers in the industry space? Let’s take a look. Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) currently trades with a market capitalization of $54.81 Billion. That value represents a market adjusting for revenues that have been growing by 90.80 % on a quarterly year/year basis as of the company’s last quarterly report. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For MU, the company currently has $4.63 Billion of cash on the books, which is offset by $1.26 Billion current liabilities. You can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $3.43 Billion over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to fall in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $2.19 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 81.08% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors. Technical Analysis It’s important to check the technicals to get a sense of how MU has been acting. Looking at the stock’s movement on the chart, Micron Technology, Inc. recorded a 52-week high of $49.89. It is now trading 1.84% off that level. The stock is trading $41.81 its 50-day moving average by -6.24%. The stock carved out a 52-week low down at $18.18. In recent action, Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) has made a move of +17.63% over the past month, which has come on Strong relative transaction volume. Over the trailing year, the stock is underperforming the S&P 500 by 18.2, and it’s gotten there by action that has been more volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. In terms of the mechanics underlying that movement, traders will want to note that the stock is trading on a float of 4.79% with $1.10 Billion sitting short, betting on future declines. That suggests something of the likelihood of a short squeeze in shares of MU.

http://www.columbiatribune.com/news/20171129/mu-students-attorney-argues-that-shooting-death-was-suicide

 A man charged with felony tampering after his roommate's shooting death had his bond terms relaxed after his attorney argued the death was a suicide, not a homicide.Boone County Circuit Court Judge Kimberly Shaw allowed DeAndre Winters, 20, to leave the courthouse Wednesday without a GPS monitor around his ankle after his attorney asked for lighter bond conditions. Winters was charged with felony tampering with evidence after police said he moved the handgun that killed his roommate, fellow University of Missouri student Richard Ward III. Another student, Darren Carter, 22, is also charged with the crime.Felony tampering occurs if an individual disturbs a crime scene, impeding the investigation of another felony offense.Winters' attorney, Josh Oxenhandler, told Shaw that Ward died by suicide, and he believes that is the conclusion police will likely reach. Winters is a film student at the University of Missouri in good standing, Oxenhandler said, and a GPS monitor is unnecessary because he is not at risk of leaving Columbia before his case has wrapped up.“This case hasn’t escalated to charges of anything other than” tampering, Oxenhandler said.Suicide is not a crime, and the scene of a suicide is not typically considered a crime scene.Ward died Oct. 8 after suffering a single gunshot wound to the head; those who knew him say the gunshot was self inflicted. The Columbia Police Department has avoided labeling the case a homicide investigation. A department spokeswoman said detectives are waiting for a report from the Boone County Medical Examiner before declaring an official cause of death.The custodian of records with the medical examiner’s office did not acknowledge or respond to an open records request submitted by the Tribune last week seeking information about the report.Assistant Prosecuting Attorney Jessica Caldera said she “agrees the charge is what it is, but" Winters’ "actions made it harder to figure out what happened in the death,” and whether it was actually a murder. She noted that Winters and Carter removed the handgun that killed Winters from the home before police arrived. Caldera did not provide a recommendation to the court about whether to reduce Winters’ bond conditions.Shaw scheduled another hearing in the case for Jan. 10. Carter is due in court in two weeks for a status review of the case. His attorney, Bill Tackett, declined to comment on the case Wednesday.ccampbell@columbiatribune.com573-815-1718 A man charged with felony tampering after his roommate's shooting death had his bond terms relaxed after his attorney argued the death was a suicide, not a homicide.

U.S. stock futures are trending higher this morning, despite an impending flurry of data set to sweep over the Street. Foremost, Jerome Powell, President Donald Trump’s pick to run the Federal Reserve, is slated to testify before a Senate confirmation panel this morning. Traders will be looking for cues on how Powell will run the central bank. Also from the Fed, a trio of regional presidents are slated to give speeches later today. On the economic front, October advance trade goods data, September home prices and the November consumer confidence index are all slated to hit near the open. Against this crowded backdrop, Dow Jones Industrial Average futures have risen 0.14%, S&P 500 futures have added 0.09% and Nasdaq-100 futures are up 0.09%. On the options front, volume remained relatively light as traders filtered back in from the holiday weekend. Overall, about 16.6 million calls and 12.1 million puts changed hands on Monday. As for the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio ticked lower to 0.61, while the 10-day moving average held at 0.63. Diving into Monday’s options activity, Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) was smacked lower amid heavy volume after Morgan Stanley warned of falling NAND chip prices. Elsewhere, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has seen a surge in both call options activity and short interest in recent weeks, while Square Inc (NASDAQ:SQ) was downgraded to “sell” at BTIG due to bitcoin speculation.  Morgan Stanley downgraded several semiconductor makers yesterday after stating that “now is the time to reduce exposure to NAND (flash memory) and Asian semiconductor names.” The brokerage firm says that they see the pricing power that bolstered NAND producers is reversing soon. While Morgan said that Micron would be fine due to its exposure to DRAM, the damage was already done. MU stock shed more than 3% yesterday, pulling back to its 10-day moving average. This technical support provided courage to MU options traders, as the stock was flooded with calls on Monday. Volume nearly doubled MU’s daily average and topped 281,000 contracts. Calls made up an impressive 72% of this activity. Expectations were already set pretty high for December, however, as the front-month put/call open interest ratio has fallen to a reading of 0.37, with calls nearly tripling puts for the series. That said, peak December call OI still rests at the in-the-money $45 strike, hinting that, despite the enthusiasm, MU options traders are still somewhat tempered in their expectations.

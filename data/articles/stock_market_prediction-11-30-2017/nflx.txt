After a two-month slumber, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) shares are finally perking up. And the timing of its awakening was spot on. Technical patterns suggested a pop was imminent and the holiday season is giving NFLX all the reason needed to begin a year-end run. Since launching higher in early October amid positive earnings from the tech sector, NFLX has been consolidating in a triangle pattern. Compression has been the name of the game as the stock has traded in an ever-tightening range. Chartists view this formation as a coiled spring — one with pent-up energy just waiting for a reason to release. Today was that release. And NFLX shares are shooting to the moon to make up for lost time. Today’s pop really couldn’t have come at a better time. The triangle’s apex was fast approaching, and any further dithering would have threatened to take NFLX below its 50-day moving average. In sizing up potential targets, $205 should be the first stop. That marks the top of the triangle as well as the current high water mark for Netflix shares. If buyers really press their advantage, look for the stock to move into $210 and beyond. To fully capitalize on continued strength into year-end, not to mention an increase in volatility, buy a Jan $200/$210 bull call spread for $4.15. The long vertical consists of buying to open the Jan $200 call while selling to open the $210 call. The initial cost represents the max loss and will be forfeited if Netflix sits below $200 at expiration. The max gain is $5.85 and will be captured if we rise above $210. By risking $415 to make $585, the potential return on investment is a mouth-watering 141%. As of this writing, Tyler Craig held bullish options positions in NFLX. Want more education on how to trade?

Recent price movements in the stock of Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) have caught the attention of the investment community. Many experts agree that the truth about a stock is best reflected in the way it moves on the chart. For this stock, the chart has a lot to say about future performance. How has the stock performed recently? Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in the last month has increased +0.28%. Shares are now up over the past year, outperforming the broad market by -100% and outperformed a peer group of similar companies by 127%. After the latest session, which saw the stock close at a price of $195.75, NFLX sits below its 52-week high. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has been trading in a bullish manner, based on the relative positions of the stock’s 20 and 200 day moving averages. Momentum indicators 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that NFLX may be headed in the future. To forecast a stock’s future performance, analysts use momentum indicators, which take into account the size and speed of these price movements. As momentum begins to slow, it may be a sign that a recent trend is about to reverse. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for NFLX is 53.51%, which suggests that the stock is not particularly expensive or cheap, and not predisposed to a reactive price movement based on this measure. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 51.08%, tells a similar story, and suggests that NFLX currently trades in neutral territory. What do the trading volumes reveal? Price isn’t the only tool analysts use to forecast future performance. Volume patterns can also reveal some important insights. If, for instance, a stock’s volumes suddenly increase by a significant amount, it’s usually a sign that the level of conviction behind the trade is high. Investors may feel very strongly about the future direction of the stock in question. Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) average trading volume of 4,952,917 during the past month is 23.19% below its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been less active than usual in the stock in recent times. What do the analysts think? NFLX is currently undervalued by -8.46% relative to the average 1-year price target of $213.84 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 2.20, which implies that analysts are generally neutral in their outlook for NFLX over the next year. How risky is the stock?  Absolute price performance isn’t the only thing analysts consider when predicting future performance: volatility matters as well. Beta, which measures the stock’s volatility relative to the overall market, is a simple but effective metric for assessing risk. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has a beta of 1.40, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are more extreme than the market as a whole. NFLX therefore has a above average level of market risk. During the past couple of weeks, NFLX average daily volatility was 18.46%, which is 6.32 percentage points lower than the average volatility over the past 100 days.

https://www.schaeffersresearch.com/content/news/2017/11/29/3-faang-stocks-set-for-worst-day-in-months

Stocks are trading mixed this afternoon, with the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) sinking with tech stocks. Among the names making big moves  lower are FAANG stocks Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB),   Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL).  Here's a quick look at what's moving shares of FB,  NFLX, and GOOGL. Shares of Facebook stock have moved lower, down 4% at $175.13 -- set for their second-worst day of 2017 -- despite receiving a positive analyst note from Barclays, which opined that the social media company should be able to offset slowing ad impression growth by increasing ad prices. The analysts reiterated their "buy" endorsement and $215 price target, which represents a premium of nearly 23% to FB stock's current perch, and stands in uncharted territory. Facebook stock just yesterday touched an all-time high of $184.25, and could find an ally in its  80-day moving average, which has acted as support since early January. FB has a Schaeffer's Volatility Index (SVI) of 16%, which ranks just 12 percentage points from a 12-month low. In other words, volatility expectations via short-term options are unusually muted right now -- a boon for premium buyers. Today, however, Facebook options are more popular than usual, crossing the tape at twice the average intraday pace, with roughly 260,000 calls and 115,000 puts exchanged. Netflix stock is joining fellow FAANG stock FB in the red, and was last seen trading down 5.1% at $189.10 -- on pace for its worst one-day percentage loss in over a year. However, the online streaming stock is still up 60% year-over-year, and earlier bounced off its own 80-day trendline. Call buying has been accelerated on NFLX recently. Data from the International Securities Exchange (ISE), Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), and NASDAQ OMX PHLX (PHLX) shows NFLX with a 10-day call/put volume ratio of 1.54, which ranks in the 84th percentile of its annual range. This suggests calls were bought to open over puts at a faster-than-usual clip during the past two weeks.  However, near-term options buyers were getting the contracts at a relative bargain, with the stock's SVI of 23% ranking in just the 6th percentile of its annual range. Today, NFLX options are changing hands at three times the average intraday clip, with roughly 117,000 calls and 58,000 puts traded so far.     Shares of Alphabet have also dropped, as the Google parent was last seen down 2.7% at $1,034.46 -- set for its steepest percentage loss since late July.  However, Alphabet stock is still up 30% for 2017, and yesterday notched a record high of $1,080 after news of a criminal investigation into Uber espionage delayed a trial between the ride-share company and Google unit Waymo. GOOGL has also seen an influx of call buying at the ISE, CBOE, and PHLX, most recently sporting a 10-day call/put volume ratio of 1.84, ranking in the 97th percentile of its annual range. Today, options on the FAANG stock are running at twice the average afternoon pace, with about 23,000 calls and 14,000 puts traded.

https://stocknewsgazette.com/2017/11/29/how-does-the-fundamental-picture-look-for-netflix-inc-nflx-2/

Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)’s interesting series of developments are underway around the US stock market these days. Now trading with a market value of 86.44B, the company has a mix of catalysts and obstacles that spring from the nature of its operations. In light of the many issues surrounding this company, we thought it was a good time to take a close look at the numbers in order to form a realistic perspective on the fundamental picture for this stock. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) Fundamentals That Matter It’s generally a good idea to start with the most fundamental piece of the picture: the balance sheet. The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For NFLX, the company currently has 1.75 billion of cash on the books. The trend over time is important to note. In this case, the company’s debt has been growing. The company also has 16.95 billion in total assets, balanced by 13.62 billion in total liabilities, which should give you a sense of the viability of the company under any number of imagined business contexts. Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) saw -453.57 million in free cash flow last quarter, representing a quarterly net change in cash of -172.31 million. Perhaps most importantly where cash movements are concerned, the company saw about -419.61 million in net operating cash flow. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) Revenue Growth Potential As far as key trends that demonstrate something of the future investment potential of this stock, we need to take a closer look at the top line, first and foremost. Last quarter, the company saw 2.98 billion in total revenues. That represents a quarterly year/year change in revenues of 0.30 in sequential terms, the NFLX saw sales decline by 0.07. But what about the bottom line? After all, that’s what really matters in the end. Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) is intriguing when broken down to its core data. The cost of selling goods last quarter was 1.99 billion, yielding a gross basic income of 991.88 million. For shareholders, given the total diluted outstanding shares of 447.36 million, this means overall earnings per share of 0.29. Note, this compares with a consensus analyst forecast of 0.42 in earnings per share for its next fiscal quarterly report. 
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Is Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) Valuation Attractive Looking ahead at valuations, according to the consensus, the next fiscal year is forecast to bring about 2.29 in total earnings per share. If we consider a median price to earnings ratio on the stock, that corresponds with a stock price of 87.19. However, one should always remember: the trends are more important than the forecasts. This continues to be an interesting story, and we look forward to updating it again soon on Netflix, Inc..

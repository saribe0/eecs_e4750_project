Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is on our radar right now but there could still be some opportunities on the horizon. Now trading with a market value of 52.87B, the company has a mix of catalysts and obstacles that spring from the nature of its operations. As the day-to-day narrative ebbs and flows for this company, it is more important than ever to step back and get a bird’s eye view of the fundamental reality under the surface of this story. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) Fundamentals That Matter It’s generally a good idea to start with the most fundamental piece of the picture: the balance sheet. The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For TSLA, the company currently has 3.67 billion of cash on the books, which is offset by 441.72 million in current liabilities. The trend over time is important to note. In this case, the company’s debt has been falling. The company also has 28.11 billion in total assets, balanced by 21.93 billion in total liabilities, which should give you a sense of the viability of the company under any number of imagined business contexts. Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) saw -1.55 billion in free cash flow last quarter, representing a quarterly net change in cash of 494.11 million. Perhaps most importantly where cash movements are concerned, the company saw about -300.56 million in net operating cash flow. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) Revenue Growth Potential As far as key trends that demonstrate something of the future investment potential of this stock, we need to take a closer look at the top line, first and foremost. Last quarter, the company saw 2.98 billion in total revenues. That represents a quarterly year/year change in revenues of 0.30 in sequential terms, the TSLA saw sales decline by 0.07. But what about the bottom line? After all, that’s what really matters in the end. Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) is intriguing when broken down to its core data. The cost of selling goods last quarter was 2.52 billion, yielding a gross basic income of 459.94 million. For shareholders, given the total diluted outstanding shares of 167.29 million, this means overall earnings per share of -3.70. Note, this compares with a consensus analyst forecast of -3.75 in earnings per share for its next fiscal quarterly report. 
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Is Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) Valuation Attractive Looking ahead at valuations, according to the consensus, the next fiscal year is forecast to bring about -6.87 in total earnings per share. If we consider a median price to earnings ratio on the stock, that corresponds with a stock price of 9,999. However, one should always remember: the trends are more important than the forecasts. This continues to be an interesting story, and we look forward to updating it again soon on Tesla, Inc..

http://www.nasdaq.com/article/why-tesla-tsla-could-charge-more-for-its-electric-semi-truck-cm882448

A week after its unveiling, Tesla (TSLA) finally revealed the price of its all-electric driverless semi trucks, effectively signaling what some believe is the beginning of the end for trucks operating on gas and diesel. The company announced that the 500-mile range electric semi will start at $180,000, while the 300-mile range version will be set for $150,000. There’s also a premium Founders series which the company has priced at $200,000. Production is expected to begin in 2019, for which the company is charging a base reservation price of $20,000, broken down as a $5,000 deposit and $15,000 wire transfer upon order. But as an unabashed cheerleader of Tesla’s breakthrough battery technology and a shareholder, I question how effective this pricing strategy will be, especially given the struggles the company has already experienced with producing the Model 3? I believe Tesla is undercutting its own battery technology breakthrough. As it stands, six major transportation companies have announced plans to be among the first try out the new big rig, according to Transport Topics News. Among those, retail giant Wal-Mart (WMT) and transportation company J.B. Hunt (JBHT) have already committed to a specific number of trucks. Wal-Mart, which said that it wants to learn how the trucks will fit into its supply chain, told CNBC that fifteen trucks were being ordered, five for its U.S.-based operation and ten for Canada. The company also said that it wants to lean how the trucks “could help us meet some of our long-term sustainability goals, such as lowering emissions.” Meanwhile, J.B. Hunt CEO John Roberts, who plans to purchase several trucks, said that “Tesla trucks marks an important step in our efforts to implement industry-changing technology.” Loblaw, Canada's food and pharmacy leader, plans to order 25 trucks for its Canada operations. Meijer, a family-owned grocery chain, said it plans to tests the trucks before making a decision to purchase. The demand is apparent. And while the all-electric semi might seem pricey when compared to the a typical diesel truck that starts around $120,000, I believe Tesla can and should charge more for the trucks, given their exceptional cost-saving features when compared to their gas and diesel competitors. Tesla said the new trucks will operate at a savings of 25 cents per mile over a comparable diesel truck. While calling it “economic suicide” to continue using diesel trucks, CEO Elon Musk last week pointed out that the trucks will cost companies 20% less per mile to operate. “You’re earning 50% more per mile than in a diesel truck,” he said. This means assuming companies opt for the $150K 300-mile range model, companies can easily recoup the extra $30K in up-front costs of the 500-mile range electric semi within the first couple of years, assuming 25-cents per mile savings is accurate. As such, Tesla, which has been criticized for its high rate of cash burn, might be leaving some money on the table — money that it can use to benefit production of the Model 3 car, which is ultimately the key to its success.

Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) is an interesting player in the Consumer Goods space, with a focus on Auto Manufacturers – Major. The stock has been active on the tape, currently trading at $315.55, up from yesterday’s close by 0.94%. Given the stock’s recent action, it seemed like a good time to take a closer look at the company’s recent data. Fundamental Analysis Money managers are always interested in a company that can find the right recipe of fundamental data because it reflects something important going on underneath the surface. Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) currently trades with a market capitalization of $52.54 Billion. That value represents a market adjusting for revenues that have been growing by 29.86 % on a quarterly year/year basis as of the company’s last quarterly report.

 The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For TSLA, the company currently has $3.67 Billion of cash on the books, which is offset by $441.72 Million current liabilities. You can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $-4.88 Billion over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to grow in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $-3.07 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 58.99% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors. Technical Analysis It’s important to check the technicals to get a sense of how TSLA has been acting. Looking at the stock’s movement on the chart, Tesla, Inc. recorded a 52-week high of $389.61. It is now trading 74.06% off that level. The stock is trading $335.79 its 50-day moving average by 20.24%. The stock carved out a 52-week low down at $180.00. In recent action, Tesla, Inc.

Over the trailing year, the stock is underperforming the S&P 500 by 17.96, and it’s gotten there by action that has been less volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. In terms of the mechanics underlying that movement, traders will want to note that the stock is trading on a float of 22.41% with $125.33 Million sitting short, betting on future declines. That suggests something of the likelihood of a short squeeze in shares of TSLA.

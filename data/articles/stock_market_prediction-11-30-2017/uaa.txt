 The UAA men's basketball team will return to the court Thursday for its fifth game in nine days when it takes on undefeated Montana State-Billings.  The game is part of an Alaska Airlines Center doubleheader that tips off with a 5:15 p.m. contest between the UAA women and Central Washington.  The men's team got little rest between last week's GCI Great Alaska Shootout and the start of their conference season this week. Three days after going 1-2 in the Shootout, the Seawolves opened Great Northwest Athletic Conference play on Tuesday with a 65-39 whipping of the rival Nanooks of UAF.  Now they face a streaking Billings team in a game that could turn into a defensive battle. UAA (5-4) is allowing a conference-low 62.2 points per game and Billings is allowing 64.2.  "Winning breeds confidence and they're 5-0 and they've had some success on the road," UAA coach Rusty Osborne said after Tuesday's victory. "Our staff tonight will be hammering the film, the scouts and all that stuff and getting ready for a team that's coming in with a ton of confidence."  Against the Nanooks, Osborne was able to use lots of players, which was important for a team that played three Division I teams in a four-day span last week. Eleven Seawolves logged double-digit minutes and 11 scored. "We got some big contributions all up and down the lineup," he said. "The good thing is we didn't have to extend minutes on anybody."  The biggest contributor was forward Jacob Lampkin, who racked up 22 points and 10 rebounds for his sixth double-double of the season.  The Seawolves grabbed a 16-3 lead and led by double figures the rest of the way, but Osborne said he wasn't happy with UAA's "lethargic" offense and 10 turnovers in the first half.  "We've gotta get better," he said."There's teams in our league that have a lot more firepower than us.  "We're gonna have to get some consistent scorers other than Jacob."  Lampkin, who has led UAA in scoring in four games and rebounding in eight, averages a team-high 15 points per game. UAA's second leading scorer, D.J. Ursery, averages 10.7 points a game.  The UAA women should be fresh after a week-long break following their triumph at the Shootout, where they captured the championship with victories over two Division I teams.  The Seawolves are 6-0 and ranked second in the nation. They boast a balanced offense that averages 82.8 points a game and a stingy defense that allows 55.2 points a game.  Central Washington (3-3) scores an average of 69.5 points a game and gives up an average of 65.7 points per game. Saturday's opponent, Northwest Nazarene (4-1 heading into a Thursday game in Fairbanks) averages 80.8 points per game and allows 70.6.

ANCHORAGE, Alaska (KTUU) - Dimond High School’s Jahnna Hajdukovich on Monday held the ceremonial signing of her National Letter of Intent to play women's basketball at UAA. Basketball is the name of the game in the Hajdukovich family-- her father Jim Hajdukovich played for the Seawolves men’s team from 1995 to 1999. “My dad is in the hall of fame there (UAA), and has some records I'm hoping to break,” said Jahnna Monday. “That's the goal anyways, but that's not the only reason I went there.” It’s easy to see why the Dimond senior would want to join a program that is currently ranked second in the nation for NCAA Div. II women’s basketball, and just won its seventh Great Alaska Shootout title. "It's definitely intimidating, but I can't wait to jump into it,” said Hajdukovich. “I can't wait to contribute, and be a part of the program.” It’s also simple to see why UAA showed interest in Hajdukovich as well.   Her prep hoops resume includes being named to the all-state tournament team twice, and averaging 12.3 points per game at state.  The senior guard has just one thing missing from her resume: “I really want to be a state champ, that is my ultimate goal, and I think that me signing really gives me individual focus to help the team (Dimond).”

FAIRBANKS — The University of Alaska Fairbanks men’s and women’s Nordic ski team fell to in-state rival Alaska Anchorage in the 14th annual Nordic Cup on Sunday afternoon at Hatcher’s Pass.  UAA finished the two-day event in 4 hours, 49 minutes and 49.4 seconds, while UAF posted a total time of 4:56:10.5. On Sunday, the Seawolves’ mixed gender relay team of Marte Hakenstad-Braten, Hailey Swirbull, Tracen Knopp and Toomas Kollo won the 4x5-kilometer relay in 1:04:42.8 at the independence Mine Trails. The Nanooks’ mixed gender relay team consisting of Anna Darnell, Ann-Cathrin Uhl, Jan Cech and Arnaud Guyon took second, finishing the event in 1:04:59.5 Alaska Anchorage also finished third in 1:06:21.0, though Alaska’s second relay team, which features Anja Maijala, Hannah Dueling, Seiji Takagi and Max Donaldson, took fourth in 1:06:28.7.

The Seawolves’ top men’s team captured first in the 10km with a time of 88:23.6, while the Nanooks’ top squad finished in 88:50.4. Anchorage’s top three women tallied a time of 70:22.0 in the 7.5km, and Alaska’s completed the course in 75:51.9. “I’ve got to give credit to UAA and their coaching staff because they have a much stronger team than what we’ve faced in recent years, especially on the women’s side,” Nanooks head coach Nick Crawford said Saturday in UAF news release. “Their last two years of recruiting have been very successful and I expect that they’ll have a very good season ahead.” Alaska’s men were led by redshirt senior Jan Cech, who took second among college skiers and third overall with a time of 20:19.5. Senior Seiji Takagi (29:41.0) finished fifth overall and classmate Alexander Eckert (29:49.9) captured seventh.

ANCHORAGE, Alaska (KTUU) - Closing out their portion of a 40-year Anchorage Thanksgiving tradition, the UAA Seawolves' women's basketball team came back from a deficit in the final minute of the game Thursday to win the women's championship of the final Great Alaska Shootout. A last-minute layup set the Seawolves' 59-53 win over Tulsa. The Seawolves tipped off against the Tulsa Golden Hurricane Thursday afternoon, after defeating Maryland Eastern Shore on Tuesday. [40 Years of the Great Alaska Shootout] 

https://www.adn.com/sports/uaa-athletics/2017/11/23/roadrunners-run-away-with-shootout-victory-over-seawolves-in-mens-basketball/

 It was a record-breaking and record-tying night for the UAA men's basketball team on Wednesday – but not in a good way.  ­Cal State-Bakersfield overshadowed UAA's solid defensive effort with its own dominating pressure on defense in a 59-39 Roadrunners' victory in a Great Alaska Shootout game at the Alaska Airlines Center.  UAA mustered 14 points in the first half, a record low at home, and its 39 points tied Drake for the lowest scored in a Shootout game. Drake set the record in 2010 in an 82-39 loss to St. John's.  "I thought what we do defensively really kind of bothered them because we get out and press," said Cal State-Bakersfield coach Rod Barnes, who is 106-88 in his six years with the Division I Roadrunners. "They're a team that shoots a lot of 3s and I thought our guys did a great job getting to their shooters."  After Bakersfield (3-2) went out to an early 8-2 lead, UAA fought back to get within one point on a D.J. Ursery jumper that made it 14-13 Roadrunners with five minutes to go in the half. But UAA didn't score another field goal for the rest of the period.  The Seawolves (3-3) shot 28.6 percent from the field, 10 percent from beyond the arc and failed to get a player in double figures.  Ursery, a senior guard, and junior guard Josiah Wood led the UAA with nine points apiece.  "The way they press, we can't really replicate in practice," UAA coach Rusty Osborne said. "Until you get out there, that's the first you're going to experience it."  UAA's leading scorer forward Jacob Lampkin was hurt with foul trouble early in the game and finished with six points and two rebounds in 23 minutes.  Lampkin picked up his third foul midway through the first half with Bakersfield leading 14-8, and he only played one minute the rest of the period.  Barnes said the Roadrunners focused on getting the ball into the post early in the game to force the 6-foot-9 Lampkin into tough defensive situations.  "I thought early on, it really helped us that the big kid (Lampkin) got in foul trouble a little bit and they took him out," Barnes said.  The Roadrunners were paced by big man Aly Moataz, a 6-foot-11 center from Alexandria, Egypt, who registered 16 points and a couple of huge dunks. Junior guard Rickey Holdon added 14 points and forward Shon Briggs recorded eight points and eight rebounds.  The Western Athletic Conference team won the rebounding battle 41-26 and outscored UAA in the paint 32-18.  Osborne said there were some positive takeaways, like only turning the ball over 12 times against Bakersfield's pressure, but he lamented UAA's offensive woes.  "We're just not very good offensively right now," he said. "We're disjointed."  The Seawolves will have two more chances to rebound and try to grab a win in the final Shootout. UAA plays Santa Clara, which lost to Idaho 69-59 on Wednesday, at 8 p.m., Thursday.  Bakersfield will play Idaho in an 8 p.m. semifinal Friday. Cal Poly and Central Michigan play at 5:30 p.m. in the early Friday semifinal. All games are at the Alaska Airlines Center.

Polk ANCHORAGE, Alaska — Alaska-Anchorage outscored Tulsa 14-2 in the final 4 minutes, 10 seconds Thursday to pull out a 59-53 victory over the Golden Hurricane in the 40th annual Great Alaska Shootout at the Alaska Airlines Center. Crystal Polk led TU (3-3) with 12 points, Kendrian Elliott added 11, and Shug Dickson had 10 points and a team-best nine rebounds and four assists. Dickson and Polk were named to the all-tournament team. The Hurricane still led by one, 51-50, when Dickson scored but was called for an offensive foul. Coach Matilda Mossman said that was the turning point in the game. “It came down to the charge call at the 1:26 mark,” Mossman said. “We had a one-point lead, Shug (Dickson) makes a basket but is called for the foul, and Alaska-Anchorage finishes with a 9-2 run. “I am proud of the way we weathered the storm when we were down 11, but UAA played really hard and played with urgency in the end.” There were eight lead change and seven ties. Alaska-Anchorage (7-0), ranked No. 2 in NCAA Division II, was led by Hannah Wandersee with 14 points. Tulsa will return to action at 7 p.m. Wednesday against Oral Roberts in the Mayor’s Cup game at the Donald W. Reynolds Center.

ANCHORAGE, Alaska (KTUU) The final buzzer has blown on the Great Alaska Shootout, with Central Michigan taking home the men’s tournament title in a nail-biting game. Chippewas winning 75 to 72 over Bakersfield, and are the 40th and final shootout champions.  Earlier in the day, UAA head coach Rusty Osborne took part in his 81st and final shootout game. The Seawolves men falling to College of Charleston 55 to 46. Jacob Lampkin had another impressive performance for the green and gold scoring 13 points and grabbing eight rebounds. Dimond High School alumni Eric Jenkins scoring his first college points of the season on a breakaway dunk to pull UAA within in one point in the second half. But the momentum seemed to take a turn after a Kylan Osborne's technical foul. Charleston would soon pull away with a big game from Joe Chealey. After the game coach Osborne shared his final thoughts on his last shootout. "We'll look back fondly on memories, and move on to the next phase of Seawolve basketball at Thanksgiving,” Osborne said. “People will appreciate it even more when it's gone, and will understand just because Duke and Kentucky aren't here, it’s still great basketball." In the third place game, Idaho takes down Cal Poly 75-66, Victor Sanders tallying 24 points in that game.  Sam Houston State also winning over Santa Clara 73-59 for seventh place.

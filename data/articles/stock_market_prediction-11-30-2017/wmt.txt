Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) received a sell-side upgrade Wednesday after recent e-commerce investments appear to be paying off and sentiment surrounding the company is starting to shift. RBC Capital’s Scot Ciccarelli upgraded Walmart from Underperform to Sector Perform from Under Perform and raised the price target from $92 to $96. One of the biggest concerns surrounding Walmart was the possibility of the company missing out on the e-commerce sales boom, Ciccarelli said. (See Ciccarelli's track record here.)  After a strategic $3 billion acqui-hire of Jet.com’s e-commerce-savy founder Marc Lore, Wal-Mart is now outpacing Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMMZN) in e-commerce expansion,with a 50 percent growth rate this year, the analyst said. Walmart has turned in $11.5 billion in online sales in the U.S. this year and is expecting 40 percent growth in 2018. With Amazon’s market cap nearly double Walmart’s, some investors are starting to view that gap as too wide now that Walmart is starting to gain online sales momentum, according to RBC Capital.  Earlier this month, retail expert Jeff Macke spoke to Benzinga about Walmart closing the gap with Amazon in e-commerce. “Walmart is taking share in every conceivable place and expanding their product offerings online so customers can shop however they want," Macke said.  "They are going to continue to take market share. Amazon.com, Inc is not a monopoly, they are just better than everyone else, but the industry will adjust. No one gets to keep all the market share." RBC Capital analyst Ciccarelli is also recognizing changes the company has made to its brick-and-mortar business, noting a significantly better store environment. While acknowledging that EBIT is still down over the past four years and earnings growth will likely be small over the near-term, Walmart is playing the long game and receiving praise from the investment community as a result, the analyst said.  “We believe investors are increasingly viewing WMT as reasonably valued vs. other consumer staples companies and inexpensive relative to AMZN, which could cause a further re-rating of the stock,” Ciccarelli said.  Shares of Walmart traded up 1 percent following the upgrade, at $97.75.

Recent insider trends for Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) have caught the attention of investors. Analysts monitor insider data to understand the sentiment of a company’s largest and most important shareholders. WMT’s insider trading patterns have some implications for where the stock might be headed. Institutions own 30.50% of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT)’s shares. The total value of these holdings, in millions, is $88,031. Among active positions in the latest quarter, 717 holders increased their positions by a total of 53.41 million shares, 721 holders decreased the positions by a total of 43.88 million shares, and 206 holders held their positions. This works out to a net increase in ownership of 9.53 million shares, and suggests that institutions are feeling bullish about the stock. Among new and sold out positions, 102 holders initiated new positions by a total of 10.85 million shares and 84 holders exited their positions by a total of 6.8 million shares. This nets out to an increase of 4.05 million shares and is a bullish sign for WMT. In the last three months, insiders executed a total of 57 trades. 6 of these were buys and 51 were sells. Insider ownership decreased by a total of 47.26 million shares, which suggests that WMT’s key executives are feeling less optimistic about the outlook for the stock. The data from the past twelve months tells a similar story: insiders executed 57 buys and 187 sells, and ownership decreased by a net of 184.69 million shares. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Short interest, or the number of a stock’s tradable shares currently being shorted, is another metric investors use to get a pulse on sentiment. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT)’s short interest is 44.06 million shares, or 3.03% of the float. This represents an increase of % in the number of shares being shorted compared to the previous reading, and implies that investors felt less pessimistic about the stock during the past two weeks. Given what the insider ownership patterns are saying, it makes sense to consider the technicals to see if these pieces of information reach the same conclusion about the outlook for WMT. A composite of 13 technical indicators that includes measures such as moving averages and momentum oscillators suggests that WMT is a Strong buy, which implies that WMT is expected to outperform the market based on prior trading patterns. Conclusion

Performance is ultimately what matters to investors, and it’s worth taking a look at the data to get a sense of where WMT might be headed in the future.

Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) received a sell-side upgrade Wednesday after recent e-commerce investments appear to be paying off and sentiment surrounding the company is starting to shift.

A steadily growing dividend is nice to have as part of any stock investment. But at the very least, income investors want to feel confident that their payout isn't at risk of being suspended or sharply reduced. As GE owners learned recently, any dividend -- even one that's paid by one of the biggest businesses on the market -- could fall victim to a surprise cut. Below, we'll test the dividend strength of another massive business, Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT), and look at why shareholders have no reason to fear a cut like that anytime soon. The retailing titan has raised its dividend in each of the last 44 years. No, that's not the longest streak in the industry. Lowe's, for one, boasts a 56-year record and Target has hiked its payout 50 consecutive times. Image source: Wal-Mart. Yet Wal-Mart's dividend record still spans a wide range of operating conditions that includes the global recession in 2008-2009. Thus, shareholders can be reasonably confident that its finances can withstand almost any financial or economic shock. At the same time, a multidecade track record like that tends to sharpen management's focus on protecting and extending the dividend growth streak. After all, no CEO wants to preside over Wal-Mart's first payout cut as a public company. Instead, executives prefer to be good stewards of capital. "I'm proud of Wal-Mart's long record of shareholder returns," Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs told investors in the company's 2016 shareholder letter . Wal-Mart's payout is backed by an ample cushion of both profits and cash. Its $2-per-share dividend payment in fiscal 2017 represented less than half of the $4.38 per share that the retailer generated in earnings. That coverage is even stronger when you look at free cash flow, which has been above $15 billion in each of the last three fiscal years while the dividend commitment is just $6.2 billion.  WMT Payout Ratio (TTM) data by YCharts. Still, the earnings payout ratio has been climbing recently even as dividend growth slowed. Wal-Mart's current 50% earnings payout is significantly higher than the 38% it reached in 2014. That's because net income has declined over the past two years as the retailer spent aggressively on improving its in-store experience and building out its e-commerce shopping and delivery infrastructure. The retailer's payout ratio is still about average, and nowhere near concerning levels of 70% or more, but it's worth investors keeping an eye on in case it continues to climb much above 50%. Wal-Mart's spending initiatives have helped produce a decent improvement in operating trends lately. Customer traffic rose by 1.5% in the most recent quarter while Wal-Mart's digital sales channel enjoyed a 50% revenue spike. Income investors must hope that this positive market share momentum eventually returns the company to a path of consistently expanding earnings. Otherwise, they're likely to see weak dividend raises in the future that track closer to the 2% hikes that Wal-Mart announced in each of the last three fiscal years. Ultimately, the dividend is backed by a formidable track record and an annual earnings haul that would make a cut unlikely in all but the most dire economic circumstances. Investors have to weigh that stability against the prospect for tiny annual raises ahead, should Wal-Mart fail to adapt to changing shopping behavior as e-commerce eats up an increasing proportion of the traditional retailing industry. 10 stocks we like better than Wal-Mart Stores When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

http://www.nasdaq.com/article/interesting-january-2019-stock-options-for-wmt-cm882670

Consistently, one of the more popular stocks people enter into their stock options watchlist  at Stock Options Channel is Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (Symbol: WMT). So this week we highlight one interesting put contract, and one interesting call contract, from the January 2019 expiration for WMT. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting, is at the $82.50 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $3.15. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 3.8% return against the $82.50 commitment, or a 3.3% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost  ).      Selling a put does not give an investor access to WMT's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. So unless Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. sees its shares decline 14.8% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $79.35 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $3.15 from $82.50), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 3.3% annualized rate of return.  makeArticleAd();  Worth considering, is that the annualized 3.3% figure actually exceeds the 2.1% annualized dividend paid by Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. by 1.2%, based on the current share price of $96.66. And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to fall 14.85% to reach the $82.50 strike price.    Always important when discussing dividends is the fact that, in general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., looking at the dividend history chart for WMT below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 2.1% annualized dividend yield.    Turning to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the January 2019 expiration, for shareholders of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (Symbol: WMT) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 2.1% annualized dividend yield. Selling the covered call at the $110 strike and collecting the premium based on the $3.30 bid, annualizes to an additional 3% rate of return against the current stock price (this is what we at Stock Options Channel refer to as the YieldBoost  ), for a total of 5.1% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $110 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but WMT shares would have to advance 13.5% from current levels for that to occur, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 16.9% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.    The chart below shows the trailing twelve month trading history for Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., highlighting in green where the $82.50 strike is located relative to that history, and highlighting the $110 strike in red:       The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2019 put or call options highlighted in this article deliver a rate of return that represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (considering the last 252 trading day WMT historical stock prices  using closing values, as well as today's price of $96.66) to be 18%.    In mid-afternoon trading on Monday, the put volume among S&P 500 components was 854,085 contracts, with call volume at 1.49M, for a put:call ratio of 0.57 so far for the day. Compared to the long-term median put:call ratio of .65, that represents high call volume relative to puts; in other words, buyers are showing a preference for calls in  options trading  so far today.

Consistently, one of the more popular stocks people enter into their stock options watchlist  at Stock Options Channel is McDonald's Corp (Symbol: MCD). So this week we highlight one interesting put contract, and one interesting call contract, from the January 2019 expiration for MCD. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting, is at the $115 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $1.30. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 1.1% return against the $115 commitment, or a 1% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost  ).      Selling a put does not give an investor access to MCD's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. So unless McDonald's Corp sees its shares fall 31.6% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $113.70 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $1.30 from $115), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 1% annualized rate of return. Turning to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the January 2019 expiration, for shareholders of McDonald's Corp (Symbol: MCD) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 2.4% annualized dividend yield. Selling the covered call at the $190 strike and collecting the premium based on the $3.80 bid, annualizes to an additional 2% rate of return against the current stock price (this is what we at Stock Options Channel refer to as the YieldBoost  ), for a total of 4.4% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $190 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but MCD shares would have to advance 12.9% from current levels for that to happen, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 15.2% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.makeArticleAd();    The chart below shows the trailing twelve month trading history for McDonald's Corp, highlighting in green where the $115 strike is located relative to that history, and highlighting the $190 strike in red:       The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2019 put or call options highlighted in this article deliver a rate of return that represents good reward for the risks.

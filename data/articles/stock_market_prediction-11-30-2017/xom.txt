Most of the investors recently have been curious over the performance of Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stock. It is widely believed that a stock’s future performance can best be predicted by analyzing prior trends and patterns in price. In the case of XOM, the chart has some interesting things to say about where the stock might be headed in the future. How has the stock performed recently? Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) in the last month has decreased -2.46%. Shares are now up over the past year, outperforming the broad market by -100% and underperformed a peer group of similar companies by -118%. After the latest session, which saw the stock close at a price of $81.42, XOM sits below its 52-week high. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has been trading in a bullish manner, based on the relative positions of the stock’s 20 and 200 day moving averages. Momentum indicators 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that XOM may be headed in the future. To forecast a stock’s future performance, analysts use momentum indicators, which take into account the size and speed of these price movements. As momentum begins to slow, it may be a sign that a recent trend is about to reverse. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for XOM is 46.24%, which suggests that the stock is not particularly expensive or cheap, and not predisposed to a reactive price movement based on this measure. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 28.29%, tells a different story, and suggests that XOM currently trades in oversold territory. What do the trading volumes reveal? Price isn’t the only tool analysts use to forecast future performance. Volume patterns can also reveal some important insights. If, for instance, a stock’s volumes suddenly increase by a significant amount, it’s usually a sign that the level of conviction behind the trade is high. Investors may feel very strongly about the future direction of the stock in question. Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) average trading volume of 8,850,079 during the past month is 17.42% below its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been less active than usual in the stock in recent times. What do the analysts think? XOM is currently undervalued by -3.49% relative to the average 1-year price target of $84.36 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 2.90, which implies that analysts are generally neutral in their outlook for XOM over the next year. How risky is the stock?  Absolute price performance isn’t the only thing analysts consider when predicting future performance: volatility matters as well. Beta, which measures the stock’s volatility relative to the overall market, is a simple but effective metric for assessing risk. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has a beta of 0.82, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are less extreme than the market as a whole. XOM therefore has a below average level of market risk. During the past couple of weeks, XOM average daily volatility was 10.03%, which is -0.71 percentage points higher than the average volatility over the past 100 days.

Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) is an interesting player in the Basic Materials space, with a focus on Major Integrated Oil & Gas. The stock has been active on the tape, currently trading at $81.42, up from yesterday’s close by 0.39%. Given the stock’s recent action, it seemed like a good time to take a closer look at the company’s recent data. Fundamental Analysis Money managers are always interested in a company that can find the right recipe of fundamental data because it reflects something important going on underneath the surface. Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) currently trades with a market capitalization of $347.74 Billion. That value represents a market adjusting for revenues that have been growing by 13.47 % on a quarterly year/year basis as of the company’s last quarterly report. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For XOM, the company currently has $4.27 Billion of cash on the books, which is offset by $15.74 Billion current liabilities. You can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $15.26 Billion over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to grow in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $0.96 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 51.78% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors. Technical Analysis Sometimes, we can understand most about a stock by simply looking at how it has been trading. Looking at the stock’s movement on the chart, Exxon Mobil Corporation recorded a 52-week high of $93.21. It is now trading 11.79% off that level. The stock is trading $82.13 its 50-day moving average by 0.70999999999999%. The stock carved out a 52-week low down at $76.05. In recent action, Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) has made a move of -2.46% over the past month, which has come on Strong relative transaction volume. Over the trailing year, the stock is underperforming the S&P 500 by 17.96, and it’s gotten there by action that has been less volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. In terms of the mechanics underlying that movement, traders will want to note that the stock is trading on a float of 0.78% with $4.23 Billion sitting short, betting on future declines. That suggests something of the likelihood of a short squeeze in shares of XOM.

It is interesting to note that Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is active and made a solid movement in the last trading day. Now trading with a market value of 347.74B, the company has a mix of catalysts and obstacles that spring from the nature of its operations. In light of the many issues surrounding this company, we thought it was a good time to take a close look at the numbers in order to form a realistic perspective on the fundamental picture for this stock. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) Fundamentals That Matter It’s generally a good idea to start with the most fundamental piece of the picture: the balance sheet. The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For XOM, the company currently has 4.27 billion of cash on the books, which is offset by 15.74 billion in current liabilities. The trend over time is important to note. In this case, the company’s debt has been falling. The company also has 349.43 billion in total assets, balanced by 160.23 billion in total liabilities, which should give you a sense of the viability of the company under any number of imagined business contexts. Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) saw 2.62 billion in free cash flow last quarter, representing a quarterly net change in cash of 224 million. Perhaps most importantly where cash movements are concerned, the company saw about 7.54 billion in net operating cash flow.

 Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) Revenue Growth Potential As far as key trends that demonstrate something of the future investment potential of this stock, we need to take a closer look at the top line, first and foremost. Last quarter, the company saw 58.55 billion in total revenues. That represents a quarterly year/year change in revenues of 0.14 in sequential terms, the XOM saw sales decline by 0.06. But what about the bottom line? After all, that’s what really matters in the end. Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) is intriguing when broken down to its core data. The cost of selling goods last quarter was 44.93 billion, yielding a gross basic income of 13.62 billion. For shareholders, given the total diluted outstanding shares of 4.27 billion, this means overall earnings per share of 0.93. Note, this compares with a consensus analyst forecast of 0.99 in earnings per share for its next fiscal quarterly report. 
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Is Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) Valuation Attractive Looking ahead at valuations, according to the consensus, the next fiscal year is forecast to bring about 4.11 in total earnings per share. If we consider a median price to earnings ratio on the stock, that corresponds with a stock price of 20.48. However, one should always remember: the trends are more important than the forecasts. This continues to be an interesting story, and we look forward to updating it again soon on Exxon Mobil Corporation.

Among the major integrated energy firms, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) deserve a special mention, since they have such massive market caps of $351.4 billion and $222.6 billion, respectively. Thus, these companies dominate and define the Zacks Oil International industry.

These energy majors have a strong earnings surprise history, as they have managed to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters. And, Exxon and Cevron have an average positive earnings surprise of 8.8% and 1.8%, respectively.
During the third quarter of 2017, Exxon Mobil’s revenues of $66.165 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $63.508 billion. Moreover, earnings of 93 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 89 cents.
Chevron’s third-quarter performance has also been impressive. Revenues of $36.205 billion steered past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $33.667 billion. On top of that, earnings of $1.03 per share surpassed the consensus mark of 99 cents.
Although both the stocks are attractive picks for investors based on their earnings reports, our research shows Exxon Mobil is a better choice than Chevron.
The Analysis
We have employed three parameters for an in-depth comparative analysis.
Strong Potential to Generate Cash Flow
Investors look for indicators that gauge the ability of a company to generate free cash flow from investments. For this purpose, we have employed the free cash flow yield ratio. Companies with strong operations generally have high free cash flow yield, indicating that the amount of money investors are generating is more than the amount spent to buy the stock.
Our proprietary model shows that free cash flow yield for Exxon Mobil stands at 4.4%, way higher than 1.9% for Chevron.
Sufficient Funds to Meet Capital Expenditure
We calculate a company’s free cash flow after deducting capital spending from operating cash flow. Over the last four quarters, free cash flow for Exxon Mobil came in at $15.263 billion, indicating that the firm has sufficient cash flow to fund capital spending. In other words, Exxon Mobil generated $30.051 billion in net cash from core operations, while its capital spending amounted $14.788 billion.
Chevron’s free cash flow of $4.376 billion is considerably lower than that of Exxon Mobil. This signifies that the possibility of Chevron to rely on debt for financing future operations is significantly higher than Exxon Mobil.

https://stocknewsgazette.com/2017/11/29/dissecting-the-numbers-for-exxon-mobil-corporation-xom-and-chevron-corporation-cvx-2/

Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) shares are down more than -9.52% this year and recently increased 0.69% or $0.56 to settle at $81.67. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), on the other hand, is down -1.06% year to date as of 11/27/2017. It currently trades at $116.45 and has returned 1.51% during the past week. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) are the two most active stocks in the Major Integrated Oil & Gas industry based on today’s trading volumes. Investor interest in the two stocks is clearly very high, but which is the better investment? To answer this question, we will compare the two companies across growth, profitability, risk, and valuation metrics, and also examine their analyst ratings and insider activity trends. Growth The ability to consistently grow earnings at a high compound rate is a defining characteristic of the best companies for long-term investment. Analysts expect XOM to grow earnings at a 21.17% annual rate over the next 5 years. Comparatively, CVX is expected to grow at a 52.03% annual rate. All else equal, CVX’s higher growth rate would imply a greater potential for capital appreciation. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Profitability and Returns Growth doesn’t mean much if it comes at the cost of weak profitability. To adjust for differences in capital structure we’ll use EBITDA margin and Return on Investment (ROI) as measures of profitability and return. , compared to an EBITDA margin of 23.15% for Chevron Corporation (CVX). XOM’s ROI is 0.60% while CVX has a ROI of -1.40%. The interpretation is that XOM’s business generates a higher return on investment than CVX’s. Cash Flow  
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 The value of a stock is simply the present value of its future free cash flows. XOM’s free cash flow (“FCF”) per share for the trailing twelve months was -0.16. Comparatively, CVX’s free cash flow per share was +0.06. On a percent-of-sales basis, XOM’s free cash flow was -0.3% while CVX converted 0.1% of its revenues into cash flow. This means that, for a given level of sales, CVX is able to generate more free cash flow for investors. Liquidity and Financial Risk Liquidity and leverage ratios are important because they reveal the financial health of a company. XOM has a current ratio of 0.90 compared to 1.00 for CVX. This means that CVX can more easily cover its most immediate liabilities over the next twelve months. XOM’s debt-to-equity ratio is 0.22 versus a D/E of 0.29 for CVX.

XOM has a short ratio of 3.64 compared to a short interest of 4.50 for CVX. This implies that the market is currently less bearish on the outlook for XOM.

A moving average can help cut down the amount of “noise” on a price chart. Look at the direction of the moving average to get a basic idea of which way the price is moving.

Among the major integrated energy firms, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) deserve a special mention, since they have such massive market caps of $351.4 billion and $222.6 billion, respectively. Thus, these companies dominate and define the Zacks Oil International industry.

These energy majors have a strong earnings surprise history, as they have managed to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters. And, Exxon and Cevron have an average positive earnings surprise of 8.8% and 1.8%, respectively.
During the third quarter of 2017, Exxon Mobil’s revenues of $66.165 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $63.508 billion. Moreover, earnings of 93 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 89 cents.
Chevron’s third-quarter performance has also been impressive. Revenues of $36.205 billion steered past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $33.667 billion. On top of that, earnings of $1.03 per share surpassed the consensus mark of 99 cents.
Although both the stocks are attractive picks for investors based on their earnings reports, our research shows Exxon Mobil is a better choice than Chevron.
The Analysis
We have employed three parameters for an in-depth comparative analysis.
Strong Potential to Generate Cash Flow
Investors look for indicators that gauge the ability of a company to generate free cash flow from investments. For this purpose, we have employed the free cash flow yield ratio. Companies with strong operations generally have high free cash flow yield, indicating that the amount of money investors are generating is more than the amount spent to buy the stock.
Our proprietary model shows that free cash flow yield for Exxon Mobil stands at 4.4%, way higher than 1.9% for Chevron.
Sufficient Funds to Meet Capital Expenditure
We calculate a company’s free cash flow after deducting capital spending from operating cash flow. Over the last four quarters, free cash flow for Exxon Mobil came in at $15.263 billion, indicating that the firm has sufficient cash flow to fund capital spending. In other words, Exxon Mobil generated $30.051 billion in net cash from core operations, while its capital spending amounted $14.788 billion.
Chevron’s free cash flow of $4.376 billion is considerably lower than that of Exxon Mobil. This signifies that the possibility of Chevron to rely on debt for financing future operations is significantly higher than Exxon Mobil.

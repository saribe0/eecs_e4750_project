U.S. stock futures are mixed this morning, as Wall Street struggles for new highs heading into what could be a volatile week. House Republicans unveiled their tax plan this weekend to mixed reviews, and President Trump embarked on a tour of Asia in an effort to ostensibly reach a diplomatic solution on North Korea. However, many investors will be paying close attention to Trump’s comments on North Korea, which have been quite inflammatory in the past. Heading into the open, Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are up 0.12%, S&P 500 futures have risen 0.02% and Nasdaq-100 futures are up 0.07%. On the options front, volume remained brisk on Friday, with about 19.8 million calls and 15.7 million puts changing hands on the session. On the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio fell to 0.60, while the 10-day moving average held at 0.64. Taking a closer look at Friday’s options activity, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) call options gained considerable traction after the company saw non-iPhone sales rise 24%. Meanwhile, Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) options speculation surged as rumors hit that Broadcom Ltd (NASDAQ:AVGO) was planning a $100 billion-plus bid for the chipmaker. Finally, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) had its “production hell” quip thrown back in its face after poor third-quarter earnings.  Apple silenced quite a few bears last week when it beat third-quarter earnings expectations. While iPhone sales still remain below historical levels, the company banked on a 24% jump in non-iPhone sales, which came in at $23.1 billion on the quarter. Apple also set iPhone deliveries within expectations following the launch of the iPhone X last week. That said, some analysts were quick to point out that Wall Street’s expectations had fallen since the September iPhone 8 event, and that these lowered expectations were the only reason Apple was able to turn in an earnings beat. Options traders were happy with the results, however, as calls made up an above average 67% of Friday’s take, which came in at more than 1.4 million contracts. However, the November put/call open interest ratio of 0.80 indicates that there are still more than a few bears betting that AAPL stock is due for a pullback. In fact, put OI has ballooned to more than 15,500 contracts at the $165 strike, with another 40,000 at the Nov $160 strike.

If you live in the US and speak English, chances are the “face with tears of joy” emoji is always in the recently-used section of your emoji keyboard. Apple revealed that the laugh-crying face � is the most-used emoji for that group by a large margin, followed by the heart and the straight-up crying emoji. That insight was published in a report by Apple about how the company uses anonymized data collection. As the Verge points out, the emoji also takes the top slot by a wide margin on emojitracker, a site that monitors global emoji use on Twitter. Whether deployed out of exasperation or true delight, “face with tears of joy” seems to capture something that unites us.

Apple has been on a tear in recent quarters, returning to growth, and finding massive revenue streams beyond the all-consuming iPhone. After posting $45.4 billion in revenue last quarter—a gain of 7% over the same quarter last year—Apple’s stock has soared. Every single one of its businesses—the iPhone, the iPad, Mac computers, services, and its miscellaneous “Other products” bucket—is now the size of a Fortune 500 company. There’s no indication that the company will slow down anytime soon. Apple will report its fourth-quarter earnings (its fiscal year ends in September) after the market closes on Nov. 2, and Wall Street is expecting another bumper quarter. Analysts polled by FactSet estimated that Apple’s revenue for the quarter will be around $50.7 billion, which would be an 8% increase over the $46.9 billion it generated in the same quarter in 2016. The overwhelming majority of Apple’s revenue—at least 50% of its sales every quarter for the last four years—comes from iPhone sales. This quarter is generally a relatively fallow one for Apple, as it’s the last quarter before the holiday season. For the last nine years it’s also been the last quarter before  a new iPhone has been on sale, meaning many people will hold off buying new phones until the latest ones are available. Apple’s iPhone 8 and 8 Plus went on sale Sept. 22 in the US, so we’ll likely get an update about how the first weekend of sales went, but Apple’s newest flagship phone, the iPhone X, does not debut in stores until Nov. 3, although it was announced at the same time as the 8. Expect CEO Tim Cook to give some immeasurable platitude (like “best weekend yet!” or “off the charts!”) about how the pre-orders went for the iPhone X. The real test will be how Apple fares in the quarter, given that iPhone sales are traditionally slow. Its services business, which comprises sales of AppleCare, music, apps, and movies, as well as iCloud and Apple Music subscriptions, has been on a tear in recent quarters, generating $21.5 billion through the first three quarters of the year, up 19% from the $18 billion in the same period the year before. Look to see how resilient this sector is this quarter to gauge how well Apple is keeping customers locked into its ecosystem, beyond cyclical hardware purchases. It’s also worth checking how Apple is faring outside of its home territory of the Americas. Major growth areas, such as China and India, have not proven to be quite the boon the company was expecting for a combination of regulatory and socio-economic reasons. Look to see whether Apple has started to crack selling its more affordable (read: older) models in India, and whether China can retake from Europe its place as Apple’s second-largest region. Other areas of growth for Apple can come from the rest of its product stable. This past quarter was when students generally return to school in many of Apple’s markets, so look to see whether there’s been any uptick in tablet or computer sales, and whether the iPad Pro has been as much of a hit with consumers as it was with reviewers. The same can be said for Apple’s “other products” bucket, which includes sales of Beats headphones, AirPods, (increasingly few) iPods, Apple Watches, and other accessories. Apple released a new Apple Watch along with its new iPhones in September, so it likely won’t have affected this bucket much, but it’s entirely possible that customers wanted to get out and be more active as the summer months waned, picking up new wearables and headphones to track their fitness.

 @benlovejoy Following strong fiscal Q4 earnings and guidance for a record-breaking holiday quarter, AAPL shares have hit an all-time record high of $173.25 in pre-market trading (at the time of writing), up 3% on yesterday’s close of $168.11. The current share price values the company at around $900B, taking it a significant step closer to becoming the first ever trillion-dollar company …

NordVPN The graph shows a temporary sharp drop when the price hit $174, possibly caused by automatic sales programmed for profit-taking at that price. The stock quickly rebounded. Apple’s Q4 (calendar Q3) earnings exceeded analyst expectations, suggesting that the iPhone 8 has proven more popular than expected despite those waiting for the iPhone X, and the company gave extremely strong guidance for the holiday quarter, predicting record-breaking sales. The good news didn’t end with iPhones, sales of Macs, iPads, other products and services all showing substantial growth. Investors may also be encouraged by Republican tax proposals which would make it cheaper for Apple to repatriate its overseas cash. Apple has forecast sales in the $84-87B range, against analyst expectations of $85B. This suggests confidence in both demand for the iPhone X, and ability to boost supplies. Given that Tim Cook was unable to say when supply might balance demand, it also points to a likely strong follow-up quarter in the new year. The Street reports that ripple effects from Apple’s results could contribute to the Dow hitting a record high. Check out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:  Breaking news from Cupertino.

Apple earnings (Shutterstock photo) Apple (AAPL) is set to report fourth quarter fiscal 2017 earnings results after the closing bell Thursday. The Cupertino-based tech giant, which has beaten Wall Street earnings per share estimates in five straight quarters, has made investors tons of money this year, putting up some 46% stock gains, including almost 13% over the past three months. The rising stock price, which posted an all-time high close of $169.04 on Tuesday, suggests Wall Street expects Apple, fresh of its biggest product cycle in three years, to deliver on both the top and bottom lines Thursday. In the three months that ended September, Wall Street expects Apple to report earnings per share of $1.87, up from $1.50 a year ago, on revenue of revenue of $50.79 billion, which would rise 8.4% year over year. For the full year, earnings are expected to rise 7.2% year over year to $9.00 per share, while full-year revenue of $227.41 billion would rise 5.5% year over year. But unlike previous quarters, the headline numbers alone won’t be what drives Apple stock. While the company has announced a number of new products this quarter, there are concerns that its tenth-anniversary product, the iPhone X (pronounced ten), could be in short supply for the all-important holiday shopping season. Analysts have cited channel checks, inventory and manufacturing data from Apple’s parts suppliers as reasons for the possible iPhone X shortage. The company will reportedly ship about 20 million iPhone X units this year, according to Nikkei Asian Review, which has a good track record of reporting on matters related to Apple. While that numbers sounds like a lot, it would be about 50% below what Apple originally planned to ship. Plus, those units alone could hamper next fiscal year’s revenue total by more than $20 billion. To be sure, Apple, which last Friday began offering iPhone X pre-orders slated to ship in November, hasn’t confirmed these reports regarding delays. But within minutes of the pre-order window, the company was forced to push back shipments to as late as December. The company said that iPhone X demand, which starts at $999 and averages for about $1,074, was “off the charts.” But on Thursday how the management guides for the first quarter would indicate the extent Apple can overcome production challenges. Elsewhere, there will also be plenty of attention placed on the Apple’s Services business, which grew 22% to $7.3 billion in the third quarter, topping forecasts of $7.05 billion. Services revenue, which includes Apple Music, the App Store, iCloud, Apple Care and Apple Pay, has not only grown to become Apple's second-largest business segment, it also delivers higher profit margins, making Apple less reliant on iPhones. On Thursday analysts will gauge to see the extent Services growth can continue to accelerate. Apple shares, which have a consensus Buy rating and $175 price target, currently trade for around $169. The stock could be volatile based on the forward guidance, but long-term investors who are willing to be patient should prepare to buy on any pullback as the stock is a sure bet to reach $200 in next 12 to 18 months.

Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) unveiled its latest quarterly earnings results after hours today. The company continued the streak of tech companies beating expectations as it sold 46.7 million units in iPhone sales during its fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, topping the 46 million that analysts polled by FactSet had projected. The company’s revenue totals also impressed as Apple brought in $52.6 billion, compared to analysts’ expectations of $50.7 billion, according to data compiled by Thomson Reuters. A year ago, the tech company posted sales of $46.9 billion. In its first quarter, Apple sees its revenue as being in the range of $84 billion to $87 billion compared to the Thomson Reuters estimate of $84.9 billion. The launch of the new iPhone has been a hit for the company as the release of both the iPhone and the iPhone 8 Plus saw both phones become the highest-selling phones at the moment for Apple. It’s no secret that the tech giant has been investing heavily in China recently, where sales tallied up to $9.8 billion, a 12% increase compared to the year-ago mark. Sales of iPads were particularly good in Asia as the tablets’ sales grew 39% year-over-year in India. AAPL stock gained 1.8% after the bell Thursday.

http://www.nasdaq.com/article/interesting-february-2018-stock-options-for-aapl-cm872415

Consistently, one of the more popular stocks people enter into their stock options watchlist at Stock Options Channel is Apple Inc (Symbol: AAPL). So this week we highlight one interesting put contract, and one interesting call contract, from the February 2018 expiration for AAPL. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting, is at the $160 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $3.45. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 2.2% return against the $160 commitment, or a 7.7% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost ).      Turning to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the February 2018 expiration, for shareholders of Apple Inc (Symbol: AAPL) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 1.4% annualized dividend yield. Selling the covered call at the $190 strike and collecting the premium based on the $3.35 bid, annualizes to an additional 6.9% rate of return against the current stock price (this is what we at Stock Options Channel refer to as the YieldBoost ), for a total of 8.3% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $190 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but AAPL shares would have to advance 9% from current levels for that to happen, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 10.9% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.

Recent price movements in the stock of Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) have caught the attention of the investment community. It is widely believed that a stock’s future performance can best be predicted by analyzing prior trends and patterns in price. In the case of AMAT, the chart has some interesting things to say about where the stock might be headed in the future. How has the stock performed recently? Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) in the last month has increased +7.92%. Shares are now up over the past year, outperforming the broad market by -100% and outperformed a peer group of similar companies by 153%. After the latest session, which saw the stock close at a price of $56.55, AMAT sits below its 52-week high. Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) has been trading in a bullish manner, based on the relative positions of the stock’s 20 and 200 day moving averages. Momentum indicators 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that AMAT may be headed in the future. Fortunately, there is way to use the speed and magnitude of these price changes to predict future performance, thanks to what are known as momentum indicators. As momentum slows, it might be a sign that a support or resistance level has been reached, and that a trend is about to reverse. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for AMAT is 67.77%, which suggests that the stock is not particularly expensive or cheap, and not predisposed to a reactive price movement based on this measure. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 81.17%, tells a different story, and suggests that AMAT currently trades in overbought territory. What do the trading volumes reveal? Volume patterns can also be useful for predicting future performance. When trading activity is abnormally high, it’s often a sign that the market feels particularly strong in one way or another about the future direction of a stock. Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT) average trading volume of 9,224,880 during the past month is 6.49% below its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been less active than usual in the stock in recent times. What do the analysts think? AMAT is currently undervalued by -5.59% relative to the average 1-year price target of $59.90 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 1.80, which implies that analysts are generally bullish in their outlook for AMAT over the next year. How risky is the stock?  When analyzing a stock’s price performance, it’s essential to take risk into account. Beta, which measures a stock’s volatility relative to the overall market, can be used to gauge the level of systematic risk associated with a particular stock. Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) has a beta of 1.84, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are more extreme than the market as a whole. AMAT therefore has a above average level of market risk. During the past couple of weeks, AMAT average daily volatility was 16.02%, which is 11.48 percentage points lower than the average volatility over the past 100 days.

Oclaro, Inc. (NASDAQ:OCLR) shares are down more than -30.84% this year and recently increased 3.86% or $0.23 to settle at $6.19. Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT), on the other hand, is up 75.24% year to date as of 11/03/2017. It currently trades at $56.55 and has returned -0.25% during the past week. Oclaro, Inc. (NASDAQ:OCLR) and Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) are the two most active stocks in the Semiconductor Equipment & Materials industry based on today’s trading volumes. To determine if one is a better investment than the other, we will compare the two companies’ growth, profitability, risk, return, and valuation characteristics, as well as their analyst ratings and sentiment signals. Growth Companies that can consistently grow earnings at a high compound rate usually have the greatest potential to create value for shareholders in the long-run. Analysts expect OCLR to grow earnings at a 14.00% annual rate over the next 5 years. Comparatively, AMAT is expected to grow at a 28.63% annual rate. All else equal, AMAT’s higher growth rate would imply a greater potential for capital appreciation. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Profitability and Returns Growth in and of itself is not necessarily valuable, and it can even be harmful to shareholders if companies overinvest in unprofitable projects in pursuit of that growth. We will use EBITDA margin and Return on Investment (ROI), which adjust for differences in capital structure, as measure of profitability and return. , compared to an EBITDA margin of 28.69% for Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT). OCLR’s ROI is 27.80% while AMAT has a ROI of 17.30%. The interpretation is that OCLR’s business generates a higher return on investment than AMAT’s. Cash Flow  
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 If there’s one thing investors care more about than earnings, it’s cash flow. On a percent-of-sales basis, OCLR’s free cash flow was 0% while AMAT converted 10.74% of its revenues into cash flow. This means that, for a given level of sales, AMAT is able to generate more free cash flow for investors. Liquidity and Financial Risk Balance sheet risk is one of the biggest factors to consider before investing. OCLR has a current ratio of 3.90 compared to 2.90 for AMAT. This means that OCLR can more easily cover its most immediate liabilities over the next twelve months. OCLR’s debt-to-equity ratio is 0.01 versus a D/E of 0.61 for AMAT. AMAT is therefore the more solvent of the two companies, and has lower financial risk. Valuation OCLR trades at a forward P/E of 9.81, a P/B of 2.02, and a P/S of 1.67, compared to a forward P/E of 15.44, a P/B of 6.95, and a P/S of 4.37 for AMAT. OCLR is the cheaper of the two stocks on an earnings, book value and sales basis. Given that earnings are what matter most to investors, analysts tend to place a greater weight on the P/E. Analyst Price Targets and Opinions Investors often compare a stock’s current price to an analyst price target to get a sense of the potential upside within the next year. OCLR is currently priced at a -50.79% to its one-year price target of 12.58. Comparatively, AMAT is -5.59% relative to its price target of 59.90. This suggests that OCLR is the better investment over the next year. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 1.70 for OCLR and 1.80 for AMAT, which implies that analysts are more bullish on the outlook for AMAT. Risk and Volatility No discussion on value is complete without taking into account risk. Analysts use a stock’s beta, which measures the volatility of a stock compared to the overall market, to measure systematic risk. A stock with a beta above 1 is more volatile than the market. Conversely, a beta below 1 implies a below average level of risk. OCLR has a beta of 1.45 and AMAT’s beta is 1.84. OCLR’s shares are therefore the less volatile of the two stocks. Insider Activity and Investor Sentiment Comparing the number of shares sold short to the float is a method analysts often use to get a reading on investor sentiment. OCLR has a short ratio of 6.93 compared to a short interest of 1.51 for AMAT. This implies that the market is currently less bearish on the outlook for AMAT. Summary Oclaro, Inc. (NASDAQ:OCLR) beats Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) on a total of 9 of the 14 factors compared between the two stocks. OCLR generates a higher return on investment, higher liquidity and has lower financial risk. In terms of valuation, OCLR is the cheaper of the two stocks on an earnings, book value and sales basis, OCLR is more undervalued relative to its price target. Finally, MD has better sentiment signals based on short interest.

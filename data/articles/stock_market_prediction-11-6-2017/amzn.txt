Source: Shutterstock Shares of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) have been on fire this year. The AMZN stock price is up 47% so far in 2017, a massive move for a now $532 billion company. For investors that have missed the move last week, there’s still a chance to get long this premier tech stock. With shares up this big, some investors feel they’ve missed the move. That feeling is understandable. I wish I had just bought Amazon stock, Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) five or ten years ago and left it at that. In any regard, there are a few catalysts left for Amazon despite this year’s massive move. For starters, the broad-based market rally has no end in sight. And I don’t say that as a blind bull. In truth, I haven’t been bullish enough. I’ve spent too much time in cash (although it’s admittedly comforting) and have pared back my winners by too much — in names like Visa Inc (NYSE:V) and Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA), specifically. From the looks of it though, any blip in the market will be bought ferociously. Investors pounce on 1% and 2% pullbacks, thus the market has now set a record for the longest stretch without a 3% pullback. That goes for the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY) and SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSEARCA:DIA). For market leaders like Amazon, investors are the same way. They want to be a part of the cloud and the commerce revolution. It helps that we’re coming into November. The holiday season should kickstart the buying appetite in the stock market, especially in an economy and market like this. Heading into the season where Amazon, eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) and others do a bulk of their business, why shouldn’t investors be excited about them? Prior to reporting earnings in late-October, Amazon had been bumbling along, actually down 6.5% in the three months prior and up just 7% in the prior six months. Remarkably unimpressive gains for a stock that’s up almost 50% on the year. That shows us that AMZN stock has been consolidating for the better part of six months. That in itself is bullish, as it has a longer base to project higher from. Even though expectations fell over the past 12 months, analysts were looking for earnings of just 3 cents per share going into the quarter. Amazon blew it away, reporting 52 cents per share. Sales of $43.74 billion came in $1.6 billion ahead of expectations and up 33.7% year-over-year. Its midpoint of fourth-quarter revenue guidance more or less hit analysts’ expectations. As a quick note, this is really impressive sales growth for a $530 billion market cap company. But Alibaba Holding Group Ltd (NYSE:BABA) just reported 60% sales growth this quarter and has a $475 billion market cap. That’s one reason why we are long this name. The lack of profit remains one concern. Last year’s $2.4 billion in net income was its best annual pull ever. In all honesty, that’s not that great. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) made $45 billion last year. Cut the market cap in half (so it’s closer to Amazon’s market cap) and we’re still looking at $22.5 billion in profit, some ten-fold what AMZN did. Valuation has never mattered with Amazon and it won’t start now. But it’s important to note.

Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock flux has recently been causing stir among the investment community. Many experts agree that the truth about a stock is best reflected in the way it moves on the chart. For this stock, the chart has a lot to say about future performance. How has the stock performed recently? Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the last month has increased +12.33%. Shares are now up over the past year, outperforming the broad market by -100% and outperformed a peer group of similar companies by 29%. After the latest session, which saw the stock close at a price of $1111.60, AMZN sits below its 52-week high. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been trading in a bullish manner, based on the relative positions of the stock’s 20 and 200 day moving averages. Momentum indicators 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that AMZN may be headed in the future. To do this, analysts often study the speed and magnitude of a stock’s price movements with what are known as momentum indicators. The logic is that as a stock’s momentum slows, it may be nearing key support or resistance levels and possibly the end of a current trend. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for AMZN is 71.31%, which suggests that the stock may be primed for a trend reversal or a corrective pullback in price. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 87.76%, tells a similar story, and suggests that AMZN currently trades in overbought territory. What do the trading volumes reveal? Volume patterns can also be useful for predicting future performance. When trading activity is abnormally high, it’s often a sign that the market feels particularly strong in one way or another about the future direction of a stock. Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) average trading volume of 3,993,790 during the past month is 12.22% above its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been more active than usual in the stock in recent times. What do the analysts think? AMZN is currently undervalued by -8.96% relative to the average 1-year price target of $1220.95 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 1.80, which implies that analysts are generally bullish in their outlook for AMZN over the next year. How risky is the stock?  In order to put AMZN’s recent price performance into context, we need to get a sense of how the stock moves in relation to the overall market. Beta, which measures a stock’s price volatility relative to the market, provides the cleanest measure of systematic risk for a stock. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has a beta of 1.48, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are more extreme than the market as a whole. AMZN therefore has a above average level of market risk. During the past couple of weeks, AMZN average daily volatility was 53.15%, which is -26.55 percentage points higher than the average volatility over the past 100 days.

Getty/Drew Angerer  You've probably heard the term "Amazoned" recently. It refers to Amazon's power to erase billions of dollars of competitor market cap by simply announcing that it's entering a new sector. It's an effect most clearly demonstrated by Amazon's recent acquisition of Whole Foods, which has sent shockwaves across competing grocery stores, brick-and-mortar retailers, and even pharmacies. To see how far this Amazon effect will go, analysts at Morgan Stanley surveyed their peers to see which sectors will be the most impacted by Amazon in the near- and long-term. Most analysts surveyed, more than 40 in total, said that food retail would be the sector hit the hardest. Amazon entering the food retail space through its Whole Foods purchase has already erased billions from grocer's market caps. In second place were department stores, with 49% of analysts saying that's the sector Amazon would disrupt the most in the next 12 months. This makes sense as consumer habits have been shifting towards ecommerce amid the retail apocalypse. In the non-consumer space, Wall Street sees logistics and transportation as the most vulnerable to Amazon, with 43% of analysts voting for this option. Retail real estate investment trusts came in second, with 36% of the vote. Amazon owns significantly less warehouse space than people think, with Walmart way out in front by that measure. The Whole Foods purchase adds about 1 million square feet of space to Amazon's warehouse holdings, but the company is looking to expand, which analysts think could upset the retail real estate industry.  Morgan Stanley's survey also asked analysts about which industries were mostly safe from Amazon's reach. They replied saying dollar stores would take the longest for Amazon to disrupt in the consumer space, while healthcare and commercial REITs would be the safest in the non-consumer space. As for the sector that has been the most unfairly impacted by Amazon? Well, that would be auto parts retailers, according to those surveyed. Shares of Amazon are up 27.55% this year.

 All three companies reported stellar earnings, blowing past estimates and laying out exciting plans for the future. All three are cloud infrastructure providers, although that's not their bread and butter (yet). All operate on a huge scale across the world and all are growth oriented (so in investment mode and no dividends). But there are some big differences too: Amazon AMZN  stands out because it's mainly a retail company. Alphabet GOOGL  and Microsoft MSFT  are both technology companies, but one drives most of its revenue from effective content distribution on its software platform, while the other directly licenses/sells its software, increasingly, as a service. So after the solid earnings reports and positive estimate revisions, one might wonder which one to invest in. The following metrics might help take a decision:  Revenue Growth    While all the companies have grown revenue over the last few years, Amazon's growth has been truly meteoric as it clocked huge sales mainly in retail (taking share from rivals) but also in technology (being a first mover in infrastructure as a service, or IaaS).    Microsoft's graph illustrates the company's ongoing transformation from an old tech company to a new age one. Its enterprise licenses ensured that a lot of revenue was annuity-based. But Microsoft is building momentum around its Office 365, Dynamics 365 and Windows as a service offerings, so even more of its revenue should become annuity based. In the interim, revenue growth can appear to flatten out as some revenue that was earlier recognized upfront is now deferred.    In Alphabet's case, revenue growth has been consistent because of Google's dominance in search and the fact that its "Other Bets" are still a very small part of the business     Operating Expense Control  Amazon's revenues are coming at a huge cost to the company mainly because of rising technology and content costs as the company tries to eat into the market that Netflix created.    Microsoft, on the other hand, saw a spike in opex because of its ill-advised acquisition of Nokia's hardware business. But the company has exercised very good discipline over the years as far as cost is concerned. Also, its geographical breadth and the fact that already offered some enterprise software in what is today called the cloud meant that Microsoft has had to spend relatively less than the others on its IaaS rollout.    Most of Alphabet's cost increase comes in R&D although marketing costs have also risen as it repositioned its brand as Alphabet and started selling an increasing amount of hardware. It has been very disciplined about G&A.     Earnings Growth  Amazon's earnings have seen several ups and downs depending upon its need to build fulfillment centers, costs to finance its warehouses for fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) services and infrastructure buildouts for AWS, or its need to provide for taxes (Sep and Mar are usually down quarters for taxes). Share count increases have been more or less consistent.    In Microsoft's case, earnings fluctuations are driven by taxes but non-operating income also influences the number. The share count has declined steadily over the years indicating that it has been one of the factors helping earnings growth.    Alphabet's earnings picture is similar to Microsoft's. The share count has also declined steadily, so like Microsoft, it has been one of the factors helping earnings growth.       Free Cash Flow (Cash Flow Less Capex)  Retail is typically a lower-margin business than technology and Amazon's margin is the lowest of the low because it prices aggressively to capture ever growing market share. AWS is far more profitable for the company, but requires significant investment at this point. So Amazon's FCF growth isn't too exciting.    Microsoft's cash cow was Windows, the operating system used by most PCs in the past. Today there are other options, but Windows still commands a dominant share. Microsoft is even more strongly positioned in productivity software (Office) and has leveraged this strength in its shift to a cloud-based model. Its R&D prowess and enterprise relationships are further supporting this move. So cash flow should remain strong.    Alphabet owns the dominant search engine all over the world that it continues to improve to date. In recent years, its YouTube platform has also been growing very fast. The company's core business is not threatened by the growing competition from Facebook FB  , Amazon and others for advertising revenue, but it has several interesting diversification plans such as self-driving cars, Fiber, Internet-beaming balloons, Calico, Sidwalk Labs, etc that can transform it into quite the conglomerate. Alphabet brought in Ruth Porat to introduce cost discipline given the many projects it is in and the result has been good thus far. So cash flow, while not as robust as Microsoft, should remain strong and growing.       Valuation  The following valuation is on the basis of price to free cash flow and price to sales. Amazon is undervalued with respect to the S&P 500 on a P/S basis but overvalued on the basis P/FCF.       Microsoft is undervalued on the basis of P/FCF but overvalued on the basis of P/S.       Alphabet is slightly undervalued on the basis of P/CF and but it is overvalued on the basis of P/S.          Conclusion  While all the companies offer strong growth, Microsoft is particularly attractive on the basis of its cash flows. That's why it's the choice with the lowest risk. Amazon generates strong revenue but it's making huge investments that aren't yet translating to solid cash flows. So there's more risk involved. Alphabet is a stock we should probably hold on to because it is relatively less attractive than the others. You can also  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy)   stocks here   .

The share count has declined steadily over the years indicating that it has been one of the factors helping earnings growth.    Alphabet's earnings picture is similar to Microsoft's. The share count has also declined steadily, so like Microsoft, it has been one of the factors helping earnings growth.       Free Cash Flow (Cash Flow Less Capex)  Retail is typically a lower-margin business than technology and Amazon's margin is the lowest of the low because it prices aggressively to capture ever growing market share. AWS is far more profitable for the company, but requires significant investment at this point. So Amazon's FCF growth isn't too exciting.    Microsoft's cash cow was Windows, the operating system used by most PCs in the past. Today there are other options, but Windows still commands a dominant share. Microsoft is even more strongly positioned in productivity software (Office) and has leveraged this strength in its shift to a cloud-based model. Its R&D prowess and enterprise relationships are further supporting this move. So cash flow should remain strong.    Alphabet owns the dominant search engine all over the world that it continues to improve to date. In recent years, its YouTube platform has also been growing very fast. The company's core business is not threatened by the growing competition from Facebook FB  , Amazon and others for advertising revenue, but it has several interesting diversification plans such as self-driving cars, Fiber, Internet-beaming balloons, Calico, Sidwalk Labs, etc that can transform it into quite the conglomerate. Alphabet brought in Ruth Porat to introduce cost discipline given the many projects it is in and the result has been good thus far. So cash flow, while not as robust as Microsoft, should remain strong and growing.       Valuation  The following valuation is on the basis of price to free cash flow and price to sales. Amazon is undervalued with respect to the S&P 500 on a P/S basis but overvalued on the basis P/FCF.       Microsoft is undervalued on the basis of P/FCF but overvalued on the basis of P/S.       Alphabet is slightly undervalued on the basis of P/CF and but it is overvalued on the basis of P/S.          Conclusion  While all the companies offer strong growth, Microsoft is particularly attractive on the basis of its cash flows. That's why it's the choice with the lowest risk. Amazon generates strong revenue but it's making huge investments that aren't yet translating to solid cash flows. So there's more risk involved. Alphabet is a stock we should probably hold on to because it is relatively less attractive than the others. You can also  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy)   stocks here   .

 All three companies reported stellar earnings, blowing past estimates and laying out exciting plans for the future. All three are cloud infrastructure providers, although that's not their bread and butter (yet). All operate on a huge scale across the world and all are growth oriented (so in investment mode and no dividends). But there are some big differences too: Amazon AMZN  stands out because it's mainly a retail company. Alphabet GOOGL  and Microsoft MSFT  are both technology companies, but one drives most of its revenue from effective content distribution on its software platform, while the other directly licenses/sells its software, increasingly, as a service. So after the solid earnings reports and positive estimate revisions, one might wonder which one to invest in. The following metrics might help take a decision:  Revenue Growth    While all the companies have grown revenue over the last few years, Amazon's growth has been truly meteoric as it clocked huge sales mainly in retail (taking share from rivals) but also in technology (being a first mover in infrastructure as a service, or IaaS).    Microsoft's graph illustrates the company's ongoing transformation from an old tech company to a new age one. Its enterprise licenses ensured that a lot of revenue was annuity-based. But Microsoft is building momentum around its Office 365, Dynamics 365 and Windows as a service offerings, so even more of its revenue should become annuity based. In the interim, revenue growth can appear to flatten out as some revenue that was earlier recognized upfront is now deferred.    In Alphabet's case, revenue growth has been consistent because of Google's dominance in search and the fact that its "Other Bets" are still a very small part of the business     Operating Expense Control  Amazon's revenues are coming at a huge cost to the company mainly because of rising technology and content costs as the company tries to eat into the market that Netflix created.    Microsoft, on the other hand, saw a spike in opex because of its ill-advised acquisition of Nokia's hardware business. But the company has exercised very good discipline over the years as far as cost is concerned. Also, its geographical breadth and the fact that already offered some enterprise software in what is today called the cloud meant that Microsoft has had to spend relatively less than the others on its IaaS rollout.    Most of Alphabet's cost increase comes in R&D although marketing costs have also risen as it repositioned its brand as Alphabet and started selling an increasing amount of hardware. It has been very disciplined about G&A.

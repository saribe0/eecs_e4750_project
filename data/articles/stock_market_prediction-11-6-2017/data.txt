Wilbur Ross Says 'No Conflict of Interest' on Navigator A new set of data taken from an offshore law firm again threatens to expose the hidden wealth of individuals and show how corporations, hedge funds and others may have skirted taxes. A year after the Panama Papers, a massive leak of confidential information from the Bermuda law firm Appleby Group Services Ltd. has shone another light on the use of offshore accounts.

So far, the “Paradise Papers” are less exciting than the Panama ones IN APRIL 2016, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) dropped a bombshell. Its articles about the “Panama Papers”, a leaked trove of documents which had been stolen from Mossack Fonseca, a Panama-based law firm, sent shock waves round the world—felling the leaders of Pakistan and Iceland, leading to multiple arrests and pushing several countries to tighten laws related to offshore financial dealings. The revelations also caused a further hardening in public attitudes towards offshore finance, which had been souring since the global financial crisis. Now the ICIJ and its 95 media partners around the world—including the BBC and the New York Times—are back with another cache of pilfered files, this time dubbed the “Paradise Papers”. This latest batch of revelations, the organisation’s sixth substantial leak investigation, began on November 6th and will be rolled out over a week. It shines light on offshore transactions linked to hundreds of wealthy clients of Appleby, a Bermuda-based law firm. These include politicians (Wilbur Ross, America’s commerce secretary, pictured), entertainers (U2’s Bono) and even royalty (arise, Queen Elizabeth). The ICIJ promises a spectacular. As the first articles went out, the consortium’s director, Gerard Ryle, wrote: “Each [ICIJ] project, in turn, has generally involved more documents, more journalists and bigger revelations. And each, in turn, has prompted new levels of outrage.” Judging from the first day’s output, however, the Paradise Papers may fall well short of their Panamanian predecessor. The articles are based on 13.4m documents initially leaked to Süddeutsche Zeitung (SZ), a German daily newspaper that was also the recipient of the Panama Papers leak. Just over half of these files come from Appleby and a service provider called Estera that used to be part of its stable. Around 6m are from the corporate registries of the Bahamas, Malta and other offshore centres. A much smaller number were plucked from the database of a Singaporean trust company. As with the Panama Papers, the SZ refuses to reveal its source or sources. The most eye-catching early stories concern Mr Ross, social-media firms and Britain’s monarch. Mr Ross, a private-equity boss turned senior member of the Trump administration, is reported to have held a 31% stake (through a buy-out firm he owns) in a company called Navigator, which received tens of millions of dollars for shipping oil for a Russian client. That client, a firm called Sibur, was part-owned by Russians with alleged Kremlin ties who are subject to American sanctions, including Gennady Timchenko, the former co-CEO of Gunvor, an oil trader. The ICIJ also reports that Yuri Milner, a Russian tycoon who invested in Facebook and Twitter, was secretly backed by two Russian financial institutions known for doing the Kremlin’s bidding. Stories about such connections are guaranteed a wide audience at the moment given heightened scrutiny of possible ties between the Trump campaign and Moscow. Queen Elizabeth’s private estate, meanwhile, is shown to have invested millions of pounds in a Cayman Islands fund as part of an offshore portfolio that was not previously disclosed. These revelations, however, are a far cry from what could be found on the darkest pages of the Panama Papers, which contained details of serious money-laundering lapses and secret accounts held by corrupt politicians and public officials, stuffed with money whose provenance took some explaining. There is no suggestion of illegal activity by Mr Ross, or of improper contact between him and Russian interests. A spokesman for Mr Ross said he recuses himself from any matters focused on transoceanic shipping vessels, has had no contact with the sanctioned individuals, and was not even aware of them until this week. The ICIJ says that Mr Milner told it his firm’s investments, including those in Facebook and Twitter, have always been based on business merits and have nothing to do with politics. He said one of the Russian financial institutions was a “passive” investor in Twitter. His firm no longer owns a stake in either tech company. Britain’s royal estate, meanwhile, insists it derived no tax advantages from its investment in the Cayman fund. Thousands of private-equity and hedge funds are registered in tax-free or low-tax offshore centres. This typically has more to do with avoiding an extra layer of taxation in the country where the fund is based than with dodging tax owed in the investor’s home country, which still has to be paid. Moreover, such funds are hardly the preserve of the rich only: many pension funds invest through them. The ICIJ also highlights the royal estate’s investments in Threshers, an off-licence chain that went into administration, and BrightHouse, a retailer accused of exploiting poor people. These look unwise, but they could just as easily have been made onshore as offshore. Plenty of nefarious things happen offshore. A recent example is the giant, globe-spanning corruption scandal around 1MDB, a Malaysian state-investment fund from which investigators in several countries believe more than $4bn was misappropriated, much of it through offshore shell companies. But the first lot of Paradise Papers revelations seem to contain nothing so damning. Moreover, the focus on Bermuda risks reinforcing the stereotype that the real culprits are small, palm-fringed islands, when it is in fact the much larger, onshore financial centres, such as London and New York, that offer the most attractive combination of respectability and secrecy—making them magnets of unparalleled power for the world’s tainted money.

Thanks to yet another massive data leak, the world has been gifted more secretive information about how the rich move their money around the world, avoiding taxes and hiding their association to dodgy financial deals. Featuring intel on everyone from the British queen to close aides of Donald Trump, the revelations made by the Paradise Papers are going to keep surfacing in the news for weeks to come. Journalists working for nearly 100 media partners are revealing their analyses of more than 13.4 million files on the world’s wealthiest—but what does it mean for most ordinary citizens of the world? Let’s first look at what a previous, even larger leak revealed: the Panama Papers. In April 2016, hundreds of journalists working with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists exposed the inner workings of a Panama-based law firm, Mossack Fonseca. Nine months after the first stories about the leaks were published, the consortium analyzed its impact: For the common citizen, the real-life effects of these developments are hard to pinpoint. In the long run, it may mean that governments are able to collect more taxes from the rich than they were able to before—because much of what these papers reveal are clever tricks to avoid taxes. But that’s not the main reason why you should care about these leaks. For the real reason for watching (and worrying) about what happens next in the offshore empire, we can turn to the leaker of the Panama Papers. Known by the pseudonym John Doe, he broke his silence a month after the leaks were published. He said he leaked the information because he was worried about “income inequality” and “understood enough about their contents to realize the scale of the injustices they described.” What Doe is getting at, as one expert told me, is the difference between the “letter of the law” and the “spirit of the law.” According to the letter of the law, much of what offshore law firms do is legal. But is it in the spirit of the law? Is it just? Is it fair? Doe’s view is that allowing the rich to avoid taxes is going against the spirit of the law. These safe havens—and the routes that lead to them—were created for historical reasons. In the 1970s, offshore routes could be used for hiding an individual’s money from corrupt governments or helping banks move money to manage currency-rate fluctuations. But thanks to highly paid, smart lawyers, offshore routes are now being abused. Doe believes that the rich people who can afford to protect themselves using these routes are committing “injustices.” This is why we ordinary citizens should care about the offshore empire. If it were a question of legality, the solution for how to deal with those implicated would be easier: Perhaps we’d taken them to an international forum that holds criminals accountable, for example. Instead, the question is about fairness—and the solution to it is much more complex. On a policy level, bodies such as the OECD have been working toward increasing transparency and exchange of information among countries for quite some time. If and when widely adopted, it would help end one of the biggest problems with the offshore world: anonymity. One way the rich use these routes is to hide their association to dodgy investments. The Paradise Papers revealed how the Russian government secured investments in Facebook and Twitter through the billionaire Yuri Milner. On the other end of the spectrum, the Panama Papers revealed how offshore law firms are able to use shell companies to fund terrorism. But to get any of these progressive policies adopted, citizens will need to pressure their representatives to act and should consider the issue when electing their next representative. Political pressure can produce action: Just look at Switzerland, which adopted policies for spontaneous exchange of information earlier this year. Though some of these initiatives, like those enacted by the OECD, started in the early 2000s, it was only after the recession hit in 2008 that they began running in full vigor. Starting with the Occupy Wall Street movement in the US, governments were forced to rethink where corporate abuse was hurting their ability to function, which led to them pushing through work on reforming offshore empires. The notion of fairness may be subjective, but the burden to decide what’s fair lies with all of us. We are the decision makers. Both the Panama and Paradise Papers are well-timed injections of motivation for us ordinary citizens to decide what we think is just. And once we do, we need to act. Without political pressure, all this will be for nought.

https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/big-data-and-ai-deals-in-energy-are-up-10-fold-in-2017

Traditional energy players are looking to analytics and automation to improve operations and manage distributed resources. Can legacy energy players remake themselves by scooping up analytics firms? 
	Energy sector investments in big data and artificial intelligence have ballooned by a factor of 10 this year, according to a new report on the sector.
	The study, by accountancy firm BDO, found mergers and acquisitions involving energy companies and AI startups had soared in average value from around $500 million in the first quarter of 2017 to $3.5 billion in the second quarter.
	The number of deals also went up, rising from six to eight. The 14 deals in the first half of this year compares to 15 in the whole of 2016. “We are witnessing the early stages of what will become an M&A trend for years to come,” said BDO.
	The firm attributed much of this activity to the need for improved analytics to manage intermittent renewable generation.
	“In these uncertain times, energy businesses adapt their strategy and look to artificial intelligence and big data to improve energy forecasts,” states the report.
	As an example, in July, an energy sector consulting firm called Willdan Group paid $30 million for Integral Analytics, a data analytics and software company.
	“IA’s software solutions are designed to solve problems arising from the transformation of an electric grid facing increasing growth in distributed energy resources, such as solar and electric vehicles,” noted Willdan in a press release.
	Another example was smart meter maker Itron’s acquisition of demand response provider Comverge in May for $100 million. As reported in GTM, the purchase gave Itron added analytical firepower to add to its existing software suite.
	Not all energy-sector analytics acquisitions conform to this picture, however. One of the deals listed by BDO was Castrol’s purchase of Romax Technology in February.
	Although the acquisition gave Castrol a foothold in the renewable energy market, the motivation for the buyout was allowing the oil company better access to Romax’s wind turbine gearbox lubrication customers.
	Utilities are leading the acquisition charge. According to GTM Research, utilities have spent nearly $3 billion on grid edge startups, many with sophisticated software and analytical capabilities.
	In July, for instance, the genset rental giant Aggreko paid $52 million for Younicos and its Y.Q software platform.
	And in May, Wartsila, a marine and power plant specialist, bought Greensmith, which had made its name in energy storage optimization and integration software.
	Other similar deals include Enel’s acquisitions of EnerNOC and Demand Energy in June and January, and Doosan’s purchase of 1Energy Systems in July 2016.
	The French energy giant EDF, meanwhile, pulled off a similar deal in reverse last year when it bought the services company Groom Energy Solutions in order to get more use out of an analytics platform belonging to one of its other subsidiaries, Dalkia.  
	Clearly, energy companies are increasingly looking to add greater software intelligence to their operations, said report author Jakob Sand, BDO’s head of corporate finance in Denmark.
	“I would believe that most of the large energy companies, including oil majors such as Exxon, Shell, BP and Chevron, are on the lookout for opportunities that can enhance their operations through data and AI or machine learning," he said.
	Besides responding to a need for more efficient and flexible operations, some of the interest in M&A could be driven by competitive concerns, BDO said. The firm’s report said 2,595 clean energy hopefuls were among the companies tracked on the AngelList online startup database.
	Many of these “are already bringing their products and services to market,” BDO said. “It leads to a situation where many large companies may have to resort to M&A to avoid losing market shares to the new kids on the block.”
	With a growing number of startups looking to commercialize blockchain-based energy trading concepts, blockchain providers could become the next big focus for corporate M&A, said BDO. There have already been several partnerships in this area.
	In June, for example, E.ON and Enel traded energy over a blockchain-based peer-to-peer network provided by IT specialist Ponton.
	And Conjoule, a blockchain platform developer hatched in Innogy’s Innovation Hub in 2015, pulled in $5.3 million in funding from Tokyo Electric Power Company and others in July. Expect more such deals to come.

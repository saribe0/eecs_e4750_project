Investors in Home Depot Inc (Symbol: HD) saw new options begin trading today, for the December 22nd expiration. At Stock Options Channel , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the HD options chain for the new December 22nd contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.  Because the $160.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 55%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.66% return on the cash commitment, or 12.08% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost .     Considering the fact that the $162.50 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 53%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.52% boost of extra return to the investor, or 11.12% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost .

 1. Introduction2. Unboxing & First Look3. Testing4. Closing Thoughts5. View All Pages Over the past 20 years, Beijing-based Edifier has been creating some of the most visually appealing speaker systems in the market. At their peak, over half the the speakers sold into the Chinese market were manufactured by Edifier and, during that time, production moved first to Shenzhen and then Dongguan. Edifier’s own site claims that these speakers offer flawless sound and a powerful audio experience with an elegant look. One look at the design of the e25HD tells you that they have already nailed the elegant look – so we began testing to see if the flawless and powerful audio claims are also justified. With a UK street price expected to come in just over the £160 mark and with the addition of optical support over the older (non HD) version, the Edifier e25HD speakers are not cheap for a set of 2.0s. That said, in a market where people are paying up to £500 for a ‘Zeppelin’, the Edifiers are also not expensive. The feature set, stunning looks and optional stalk-like stands mean that these speakers are meant to be seen as well as heard, so general/multi-purpose living room audio is the target market. You can get an idea of the product life cycle from this short video.

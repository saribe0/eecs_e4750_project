The recent progress in the stock of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) has alerted everyone to look out for right opportunity to invest. It is widely believed that a stock’s future performance can best be predicted by analyzing prior trends and patterns in price. In the case of JPM, the chart has some interesting things to say about where the stock might be headed in the future. How has the stock performed recently? JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) in the last month has increased +4.63%. Shares are now up over the past year, outperforming the broad market by -100% and outperformed a peer group of similar companies by 65%. After the latest session, which saw the stock close at a price of $101.41, JPM sits below its 52-week high. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) has been trading in a bullish manner, based on the relative positions of the stock’s 20 and 200 day moving averages. Momentum indicators

 Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that JPM may be headed in the future. Fortunately, there is way to use the speed and magnitude of these price changes to predict future performance, thanks to what are known as momentum indicators. As momentum slows, it might be a sign that a support or resistance level has been reached, and that a trend is about to reverse. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for JPM is 67.50%, which suggests that the stock is not particularly expensive or cheap, and not predisposed to a reactive price movement based on this measure. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 85.08%, tells a different story, and suggests that JPM currently trades in overbought territory. What do the trading volumes reveal? Analysts use volume trends to assess the level of conviction behind a stock’s price changes. When volumes suddenly increase above normal levels, it can be a sign that investors feel very strongly in one way or the other about the future direction of a stock, or may even have access to inside information. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) average trading volume of 11,180,930 during the past month is 18.51% below its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been less active than usual in the stock in recent times. What do the analysts think? JPM is currently overvalued by 1.6% relative to the average 1-year price target of $99.81 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 2.50, which implies that analysts are generally neutral in their outlook for JPM over the next year. How risky is the stock?  Absolute price performance isn’t the only thing analysts consider when predicting future performance: volatility matters as well. Beta, which measures the stock’s volatility relative to the overall market, is a simple but effective metric for assessing risk. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) has a beta of 1.20, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are more extreme than the market as a whole. JPM therefore has a above average level of market risk. During the past couple of weeks, JPM average daily volatility was 9.95%, which is 3.33 percentage points lower than the average volatility over the past 100 days.

Fortune Live Media via flickr    Wall Street stock analysts are about to find themselves on the chopping block, and only the best will survive.  That was the hard truth Mary Erdoes had for a room full of analysts Thursday at the BancAnalysts Association of Boston Conference. Erdoes, the head of JPMorgan Chase's $1.9 trillion asset and wealth management business, was asked about impacts from MiFID II — Europe's sweeping financial regulatory changes that will be implemented in 2018 — and painted a future in which asset mangers chop their budgets and only pay for research from top-tier analysts. "On the buy side, the larger firms will absorb the costs and figure out how that cascades its way through," Erdoes said. "It probably means they'll tighten up a lot on what they spend on sell-side research, which is why the two go hand in hand." Firms are planning to make cuts because MiFID II requires asset managers pay for research separately from commissions for trading execution, whereas it previously often came bundled with other products.  Most of the largest asset managers, including JPMorgan, are absorbing the multi-million dollar costs and funding the research internally, rather than passing the costs on to their customers. This is bad news for stock analysts, as it could result in a 50% "compression" in research budgets, according to Credit Suisse. That means less money to go around. Erdoes plainly laid out what happens next: "I was dealing with 10 of you; I don't want 10 of you anymore, I only want the five best of you." She noted that the sell-side research industry had already contracted massively in recent years, with investment banks spending "50% of what they used to spend." "So you're the precious few. The rest of them are not here. Maybe this room was five-times bigger before, I don't know," Erdoes told the audience of analysts, many of whom would presumably not be there the following year given the looming cuts. The upside? The research quality will improve as the fat is trimmed.  "It'll just make the industry better," Erdoes said. "It will constantly get you to excellence and get rid of the less than excellence." That's the cold hard truth sell-side stock analysts are facing: If you're not in the top-tier, the Mary Erdoes's of the world won't have much use for you anymore.  Some who get edged out, however, will likely find work within buy-side asset managers, she added.  Erdoes also anticipates the number of sell-side research providers will shrink, as the smaller firms will have to price competitively with the larger firms while still paying for top talent.  "It's going to be very difficult for the the bespoke, research-driven firms to be able to do that on the sell side," Erdoes said.

"It probably means they'll tighten up a lot on what they spend on sell-side research, which is why the two go hand in hand." Firms are planning to make cuts because MiFID II requires asset managers pay for research separately from commissions for trading execution, whereas it previously often came bundled with other products.  Most of the largest asset managers, including JPMorgan, are absorbing the multi-million dollar costs and funding the research internally, rather than passing the costs on to their customers. This is bad news for stock analysts, as it could result in a 50% "compression" in research budgets, according to Credit Suisse. That means less money to go around. Erdoes plainly laid out what happens next: "I was dealing with 10 of you; I don't want 10 of you anymore, I only want the five best of you." She noted that the sell-side research industry had already contracted massively in recent years, with investment banks spending "50% of what they used to spend." "So you're the precious few. The rest of them are not here. Maybe this room was five-times bigger before, I don't know," Erdoes told the audience of analysts, many of whom would presumably not be there the following year given the looming cuts. The upside? The research quality will improve as the fat is trimmed.  "It'll just make the industry better," Erdoes said. "It will constantly get you to excellence and get rid of the less than excellence." That's the cold hard truth sell-side stock analysts are facing: If you're not in the top-tier, the Mary Erdoes's of the world won't have much use for you anymore.  Some who get edged out, however, will likely find work within buy-side asset managers, she added.  Erdoes also anticipates the number of sell-side research providers will shrink, as the smaller firms will have to price competitively with the larger firms while still paying for top talent.  "It's going to be very difficult for the the bespoke, research-driven firms to be able to do that on the sell side," Erdoes said.

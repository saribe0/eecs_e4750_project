Bargain hunters are wise to pay careful attention to insider buying, because although there are many various reasons for an insider to sell a stock, presumably the only reason they would use their hard-earned dollars to make a purchase, is that they expect to make money. Today we look at two noteworthy recent insider buys.      On Wednesday, Lockheed Martin ( LMT  )'s Director, Daniel F. Akerson, made a $780,059 buy of LMT, purchasing 2,500 shares at a cost of $312.02 each. Investors are able to buy LMT at a price even lower than Akerson did, with shares changing hands as low as $307.82 at last check today -- that's 1.3% under Akerson's purchase price. Lockheed Martin is trading up about 0.6% on the day Monday. This buy marks the first one filed by Akerson in the past twelve months.  makeArticleAd();    And at Mid-America Apartment Communities ( MAA  ), there was insider buying on Friday, by Director William Reid Sanders who bought 7,000 shares for a cost of $100.11 each, for a trade totaling $700,798. Mid-America Apartment Communities is trading up about 0.2% on the day Monday.

At Stock Options Channel , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the LMT options chain for the new December 22nd contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.  Because the $305.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.67% return on the cash commitment, or 12.20% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost .     Considering the fact that the $310.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) stock took a hit today with the release of its earnings report for the third quarter of 2017. Source: Praveer Sharma via Flickr Lockheed Martin Corporation’s earnings report for the third quarter of year started off bad with earnings per share of $3.24. This is down from its earnings per share of $7.93 from the same time last year. It also wasn’t able to reach Wall Street’s earnings per share estimate of $3.26, which isn’t good news for LMT stock. Revenue of $12.17 billion for the third quarter of 2017 also didn’t do LMT stock any favors. Analysts were looking for Lockheed Martin Corporation to report revenue of $12.81 billion during the quarter. Still, it was an increase over its revenue of $11.55 billion from the third quarter of 2016. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Lockheed Martin Corporation reported net earnings of $939 million in the third quarter of 2017. This is a large drop from its net earnings of $2.40 billion reported in the same period of the year prior. While the current earnings report hasn’t been the best for LMT stock, it may still have hope for 2017. Lockheed Martin Corporation has increased its outlook for the full year to include earnings per share ranging from $12.85 to $13.15. It was previously expecting earnings per share to come between $12.30 and $12.60. Wall Street is looking for 2017 earnings per share of $12.64. Lockheed Martin Corporation’s guidance increase also extends to its revenue for 2017. The security and aerospace company is expecting revenue to range from $50.00 billion to $51.20 billion. It’s previous guidance had revenue coming between $49.80 billion and $50.00 billion. Analysts are estimating revenue of $50.59 billion for the year. LMT stock was down 2% as of noon Tuesday, but is up 24% year-to-date. As of this writing, William White did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The earnings cycle is sending some mixed signals for the first time this quarter as three more widely watched stocks provided just “OK” earnings results for the quarter. With the major indices trading at their all-time highs, “OK” results are usually likely to cause traders to start hitting the “sell” button, as we’re seeing on a few stocks today. Today’s three big stock charts analyze the price patterns of Biogen Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) and McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) as two out of three of these companies are trading lower in the wake of their earnings results creating potential buying opportunities.  Biogen shares traded strongly right into their earnings report, suggesting that the company needed to nail their earnings report to avoid a “sell the news” situation that would take BIIB stock back into its trading range. The report didn’t blow investor’s hair back, so let’s see what the chart says now:  Defense stocks have been among the groups of stocks posting strong, low volatility rallies, you know, the kind everyone likes. The problem happens when a company like that misses earnings, the way that Lockheed Martin did. This quarter’s results missed expectations, although management did guide forward earnings higher, which is the saving grace right now. So, is LMT stock a buy on this dip?

Sholten Singer/The Herald-Dispatch Marshall wide receiver Tyre Brady turns a catch up field as the Herd takes on FIU in a C-USA football game on Saturday, Oct. 28, 2017, at Joan C. Edwards Stadium in Huntington, W.Va. HUNTINGTON - There is a nice balance building among the Marshall University wide receivers. On the outside, there is the playmaking ability of Tyre Brady - a long, athletic target with a nose for a big catch. And on the inside, there is Marcel Williams - a precise route-runner who uses his speed and quickness in cuts to break away from the defense. It is serving as the ultimate compliment for the Thundering Herd passing attack. In the last two weeks, both players have shown their explosiveness, combining to catch 30 passes for 397 yards and two touchdowns. It is part of a one-two punch that has led the Marshall air attack forward. "We threw the ball well offensively," Marshall head coach Doc Holliday said Friday night after Florida Atlantic beat the Herd, 30-25. "We just didn't take care of it." While the four interceptions thrown by quarterback Chase Litton are the glaring statistic in the contest, Williams and Brady both provide a positive note as Marshall (6-3, 3-2 Conference USA) moves forward and focuses on Western Kentucky (5-4, 3-2 C-USA) in a 6:30 p.m. Saturday game in Joan C. Edwards Stadium. Williams averaged 30 yards per catch in Friday's loss to Florida Atlantic, hauling in four passes to lead the Herd with 122 receiving yards. Three of Williams' four catches led to scores, and it was another strong outing after catching nine passes for 92 yards and a score in the loss to FIU the previous week. Williams said it is all about getting into a rhythm with Litton and with what a defense is showing. "It's something we've worked on from day one - just getting a feel for it," Williams said. "Later on in the year after you see certain coverages and get a feel for each other. You know you are getting the ball in certain coverages and you go and talk to the quarterback on and off the field. We've been through seven or eight games so you get a feel for it and work a route to get open." Litton said with the experience they've gained, Williams is a target that is one of the tops on his radar and a player that is breaking out for big gains consistently. "You get him the ball and he can do that," Litton said. "I have to do a better job of getting No. 9 the ball." Williams has really come on in the last few weeks, and Brady has maintained his consistency despite seeing a wealth of different coverages geared toward taking him away. Brady caught eight passes for 82 yards Friday against Florida Atlantic and hauled in nine receptions for 101 yards and a touchdown in the FIU loss. Currently, Brady is second in C-USA in two categories - receptions per game (6.1) and receiving yards per game (86.2). He also is tied for the C-USA lead in touchdown receptions with seven. With Williams' surge in production and Brady's consistency, Marshall has a two-man combination that is keeping the Herd offense moving through the air.

By Morgan Smith Nov. 4, 2017 Nanova Biomaterials Inc., a dental and orthopedics manufacturing startup company founded by two MU professors and colleagues, has created a new product that whitens teeth with the use of a smartphone. The product, Novashine, was developed by PlasmaDent, an affiliate of the original company, Nanova Inc. Founded in 2007, the company was started by four researchers, two of whom are professors Hao Li and Qingsong Yu of the mechanical and aerospace engineering department at the MU College of Engineering. “We applied the technology and knowledge we have always been trying to develop a better product,” Li said, who is also Nanova’s CEO. Novashine consists of a specially formulated gel that is applied to the inside of a plastic tray. The LED tray lights up when plugged into a computer or smartphone and is meant to be applied to the teeth for 15 to 30 minutes each use. The gel uses only 6 percent hydrogen peroxide, making it 100 percent safe for enamel, according to Novashine’s website. “We developed this teeth whitening gel with less sensitivity and better whitening performance,” senior scientist Xiaoqing Dong said. Dong joined the company after working in Yu’s lab at MU. Li said a focus of Nanova is improving the lives of Columbia residents, including students of the many colleges nearby.  “We create jobs here, we provide internships for Mizzou students and students from other universities, we provide funding and we also donate some money for research,” Li said. Li received the National Science Foundation’s Faculty Early Career Development Program award for his work in 2009. After envisioning Nanova Inc., he brought together Yu as well as Nanova chief scientist Meng Chen, an MU associate professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering, and orthopedic doctor Kenneth Lambert to aid in founding the company. Since its conception, Yu said Nanova Inc. has grown to encompass over 50 employees, three buildings and three main focuses. Li said these include the development of medical devices and pharmaceuticals. Additionally, the company addresses environmental protection through Nanova Environmental, which works to advance environmental monitoring. “Since we have started, the core team has raised about $10 million for research and over $30 million in venture capital investment,” Li said. “[Nanova Inc.] may make some contributions to the economic development of Columbia.” Yi Gan, recent MU graduate with a master’s in business administration, said working as a marketing manager at Nanova has allowed her to explore every area of her passion for entrepreneurship, including speaking at local business events. “We do a lot of things. We design the product, we do market research, we launch the product, everything; I really like it,” Gan said. Currently selling Novashine for $59.99 on both the Novashine website and Amazon, Dong said PlasmaDent plans to eventually have its product on the shelves of Walgreens, Walmart and other retail stores. MU students, faculty and alumni can receive 10 percent off their purchase on the Novashine website by using the promotional code Fall2017. Nanova Biomaterials Inc. has also produced and sold products such as dental filling composites, fluoride varnish and teeth whitening gel. In previous years, the company has received attention for its trademark plasma brush, the first of it’s kind to make cavity fillings longer lasting and nearly painless. “Our slogan is ‘Better life through innovation,’” Li said. “We want to solve clinical problems and improve the health care of people; I think that’s kind of our goal.” Edited by Olivia Garrett | ogarrett@themaneater.com Share: Facebook / Twitter / Google+ 0 comments This item does not have any approved comments yet.

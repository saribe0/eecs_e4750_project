The day before Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is set to release the second season of its hit original series Stranger Things, let’s take a look at why the streaming service is still a great growth investment despite already soaring over the last few years. As many investors already know, growth stocks can be a ton of fun because they present the opportunity for potentially massive returns. With that said, investors can’t just pick stocks at random and hope they turn into the next Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). What they can do, however, is look for companies that currently present the possibility for hefty gains based on real growth opportunities within a business. Based on these criteria, growth-minded investors might think about taking a long look at Netflix stock. Last quarter, NFLX revenue jumped 33% in its all-important streaming sector. On top of that, the video-streaming powerhouse added 5.3 million subscribers—pushing the company’s total to 109.3 million worldwide. The company projects that it will add another 6.3 million subscriptions this quarter. Netflix also announced plans to spend up to $8 billion on content in 2018.

     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 NFLX has witnessed its long term and short term MA triggering a buy signal. Many traders watch for short-term averages to cross above long-term averages to signal the beginning of a uptrend. Upon corrections, the price will meet support from the averages between $195.97 and $190.19. A break down through these support points will trigger sell signals. Some other technical concerns emerged as well, putting in risk the future growth of the stock in the next couple of days. Its pivot point high generated sell signal on Friday October 27, 2017, which calls for additional declines until the stock forms a new pivot point low, as this could be a buying opportunity. Volume up and price depreciating is getting our attention as this movement is seen as bearish sign. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) Support And Resistance Levels Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) recorded volume accumulation so there will probably be a surplus of buyers at $195.54.

 Accumulated volume is going to prevent the price from rising further at $198.02 and this action will lead the price to take a temporary pause or stay muted for a few days. Netflix, Inc.

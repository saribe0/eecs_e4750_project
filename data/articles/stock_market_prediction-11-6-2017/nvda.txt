Source: Shutterstock Now that Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has passed through the $200-mark on its way to $350, I’ve got my eyes focused on three numbers that could move NVDA stock higher as we move through 2017 and into 2018. In my last article about NVDA stock, I stated that it would hit $350 by the end of calendar 2019 and before Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) hits $25.  To have a hope of achieving this, Nvidia has got to hit some targets over the next 24 months. Here are three numbers I believe are critical to its success or failure.  Over Nvidia’s past seven fiscal years, its Tegra processor segment’s revenue has never been higher than $824 million. That mark was achieved in fiscal 2017. It got as low as $198 million in fiscal 2011.  It’s time to break through $1 billion for the first time. As of the end of July, its halfway point of fiscal 2018, the segment had revenue of $665 million. That represents double its revenue in the same quarter a year earlier.  When Nvidia reports its Q3 2018 earnings November 9, I’ll be looking to see how the segment performed in the quarter. Over the past five quarters, it has managed to grow the segment’s revenue four of those times sequentially. Revenue in Q2 2018 was flat from the first quarter.  So, I want to see more than $333 million in revenue from its Tegra processor segment in Q3 2018. I also want to see more revenue in the subsequent quarter as well. It might not be as big a contributor to the top — and bottom — line (15% in Q2 2018) but the demand for system-on-chip modules is growing. In the second quarter, Nvidia generated $1.19 billion in revenue from the gaming market — up 52% year over year and 15% sequentially over Q1 2018 — which accounts for 53% of its overall revenue.

https://stocknewsgazette.com/2017/11/06/a-side-by-side-analysis-of-nvidia-corporation-nvda-and-cirrus-logic-inc-crus/

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares are up more than 95.51% this year and recently increased 1.34% or $2.75 to settle at $208.69. Cirrus Logic, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRUS), on the other hand, is down -0.21% year to date as of 11/03/2017. It currently trades at $56.42 and has returned -1.05% during the past week. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Cirrus Logic, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRUS) are the two most active stocks in the Semiconductor – Specialized industry based on today’s trading volumes. We will compare the two companies based on the strength of various metrics, including growth, profitability, risk, return, and valuation to determine if one is a better investment than the other. Growth One of the key things investors look for in a company is the ability to grow earnings at a high compound rate over time. Analysts expect NVDA to grow earnings at a 12.92% annual rate over the next 5 years. Comparatively, CRUS is expected to grow at a 20.00% annual rate. All else equal, CRUS’s higher growth rate would imply a greater potential for capital appreciation. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Profitability and Returns Just, if not more, important than the growth rate is the quality of that growth. Growth can actual be harmful to investors if it comes at the cost of weak profitability and low returns. To adjust for differences in capital structure we’ll use EBITDA margin and Return on Investment (ROI) as measures of profitability and return., compared to an EBITDA margin of 23.86% for Cirrus Logic, Inc. (CRUS). NVDA’s ROI is 19.80% while CRUS has a ROI of 21.70%. The interpretation is that CRUS’s business generates a higher return on investment than NVDA’s. Cash Flow  
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 If there’s one thing investors care more about than earnings, it’s cash flow. NVDA’s free cash flow (“FCF”) per share for the trailing twelve months was +0.90. Comparatively, CRUS’s free cash flow per share was +1.05. On a percent-of-sales basis, NVDA’s free cash flow was 7.81% while CRUS converted 4.34% of its revenues into cash flow. This means that, for a given level of sales, NVDA is able to generate more free cash flow for investors. Liquidity and Financial Risk Liquidity and leverage ratios are important because they reveal the financial health of a company. NVDA has a current ratio of 7.80 compared to 4.00 for CRUS. This means that NVDA can more easily cover its most immediate liabilities over the next twelve months. NVDA’s debt-to-equity ratio is 0.35 versus a D/E of 0.00 for CRUS. NVDA is therefore the more solvent of the two companies, and has lower financial risk. Valuation NVDA trades at a forward P/E of 51.99, a P/B of 20.85, and a P/S of 14.81, compared to a forward P/E of 11.69, a P/B of 3.12, and a P/S of 2.26 for CRUS. NVDA is the expensive of the two stocks on an earnings, book value and sales basis. Given that earnings are what matter most to investors, analysts tend to place a greater weight on the P/E. Analyst Price Targets and Opinions When investing it’s crucial to distinguish between price and value. As Warren Buffet said, “price is what you pay, value is what you get”. NVDA is currently priced at a 21.27% to its one-year price target of 172.08. Comparatively, CRUS is -18.13% relative to its price target of 68.91. This suggests that CRUS is the better investment over the next year. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 2.40 for NVDA and 2.30 for CRUS, which implies that analysts are more bullish on the outlook for NVDA. Risk and Volatility To gauge the market risk of a particular stock, investors use beta. Stocks with a beta above 1 are more volatile than the market as a whole. Conversely, a beta below 1 implies below average systematic risk. NVDA has a beta of 1.20 and CRUS’s beta is 0.02. CRUS’s shares are therefore the less volatile of the two stocks. Insider Activity and Investor Sentiment Analysts often look at short interest, or the percentage of a company’s float currently being shorted by investors, to aid in their outlook for a particular stock. NVDA has a short ratio of 0.94 compared to a short interest of 5.31 for CRUS. This implies that the market is currently less bearish on the outlook for NVDA. Summary Cirrus Logic, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRUS) beats NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) on a total of 10 of the 14 factors compared between the two stocks. CRUS is more profitable, generates a higher return on investment, has higher cash flow per share and has lower financial risk. In terms of valuation, CRUS is the cheaper of the two stocks on an earnings, book value and sales basis, CRUS is more undervalued relative to its price target. Finally, FSLR has better sentiment signals based on short interest.

Latest evolution in the price of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has been one of the most talked about matter among the interested investors. It is widely believed that a stock’s future performance can best be predicted by analyzing prior trends and patterns in price. In the case of NVDA, the chart has some interesting things to say about where the stock might be headed in the future. How has the stock performed recently? NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the last month has increased +15.11%. Shares are now up over the past year, outperforming the broad market by -100% and outperformed a peer group of similar companies by 342%. After the latest session, which saw the stock close at a price of $208.69, NVDA sits below its 52-week high. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been trading in a bullish manner, based on the relative positions of the stock’s 20 and 200 day moving averages. Momentum indicators 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that NVDA may be headed in the future. In order to predict this, technical analysts look at momentum indicators, which measure the speed and magnitude of these price movements. The idea is that as momentum slows, it may signal the approach of key support or resistance levels and a reversal of recent trends. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for NVDA is 72.05%, which suggests that the stock may be primed for a trend reversal or a corrective pullback in price. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 91.15%, tells a similar story, and suggests that NVDA currently trades in overbought territory. What do the trading volumes reveal? Volume patterns are useful for gauging the level of conviction behind price changes, and can be used to make predictions about future price movements. A sudden increase in a stock’s activity can be a sign that investors are trading in anticipation of a catalyst, or that investors feel very strongly in one way or the other about the future direction of a stock. NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) average trading volume of 13,179,010 during the past month is 25.29% below its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been less active than usual in the stock in recent times. What do the analysts think? NVDA is currently overvalued by 21.27% relative to the average 1-year price target of $172.08 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 2.40, which implies that analysts are generally neutral in their outlook for NVDA over the next year. How risky is the stock?  Absolute price performance isn’t the only thing analysts consider when predicting future performance: volatility matters as well. Beta, which measures the stock’s volatility relative to the overall market, is a simple but effective metric for assessing risk. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has a beta of 1.20, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are more extreme than the market as a whole. NVDA therefore has a above average level of market risk. During the past couple of weeks, NVDA average daily volatility was 19.68%, which is 13.82 percentage points lower than the average volatility over the past 100 days.

 The following data is for NVIDIA Corporation | NASDAQ: NVDA | Monday, November 6, 2017 Based on the aggregate value of the company over its current share price and the total amount of outstanding stocks, the market cap of NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) is presently reeling at 123.56B. Acting as the blue chip in today’s trade, NVIDIA Corporation’s existing market cap value showcases its prevailing assets, capital and revenues. It also indicates that the share tends to be less volatile and proves to be more attractive than smaller companies because of their stability and the likelihood of higher dividend offers. The company’s P/E ratio is currently valued at 59.75, with a forward P/E of 51.99. The existing P/E value will allow investors to easily determine whether the company’s stock price is cheap or expensive. Corporations that acquires a higher P/E ratio are usually growth stocks. However, their relatively high multiples do not necessarily indicate that their shares are overpriced and not good buys for the long term. NVIDIA Corporation has a current ratio of 7.8, indicating whether the company’s short-term assets (cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, receivables and inventory) are readily obtainable to pay off its short-term liabilities. Theoretically, the higher the current ratio, the better. The corporation holds a quick ratio of 7, signifying the short-term liquidity and the ability to use its quick assets to pay the current liabilities. However, investors should also know that this is not the whole story on company liquidity. It’s ROA is valued at 23.90% marking the total profit the company generates as a percentage of the value of its total assets. Generally, the higher the ROA, the better it is. A falling ROA is almost always a problem, but investors and analysts should also know that the ROA does not account for outstanding liabilities and may signpost a greater profit level than actually derived. The firm has a ROI of 19.80%, calculating the gain or loss generated on investment relative to the sum of money invested. Return on investments is normally expressed as a percentage and is used for personal financial decisions. The existing ROI value of NVIDIA Corporation outlines the firm’s profitability alongside the efficiency of different investments. NVIDIA Corporation has an EPS value of 3.49, demonstrating the portion of the company’s earnings, net of taxes and preferred stock dividends that is allotted to each share of common stock. The current amount sensibly gauges the company’s liability per unit of shareholder ownership and indicates whether it is a key driver of share prices. The current share price of NVIDIA Corporation is valued at $208.69 with a change in price of 1.34%. Company has a target price of $172.08. The existing EPS value gives an insight into the company’s EPS growth this year at 137.90%. With this in mind, the EPS growth for the following year measures at 10.49%. It has an EPS growth of 22.20% for the past five years, indicating an EPS value of 12.92% for the next five years. The sales growth for the past five years is 11.60%.

Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has been on a huge rally recently. NVDA stock is up more than 15% over the past month and has solidly overtaken the $200 level. It seems like this is a growth stock that just can’t be stopped. But it pays to remember that every once and a while, earnings are a road bump in this growth story. Just look at the most recent earnings report. Despite big beats, NVDA stock dropped more than 5%. The same thing happened in February 2017, when a big earnings beat resulted in NVDA stock dropping. What do those two earnings reports have in common? NVDA stock had rallied big into both of those prints. But when NVDA doesn’t rally big into earnings, NVDA stock tends to jump big on solid numbers. See the May 2017 and November 2016 reports. Overall then, NVDA earnings are a “sell the news” event when the stock has rallied big into the report. They are a “buy the surprise” event when the stock has been flattish into the report. Where does NVDA find itself today? Well, the stock has rallied 33% since the last earnings report. That puts NVDA stock in the ballpark of where it was prior to the August 2017 and February 2017 reports. Prior to the August 2017 report, NVDA stock had run up 35% since the last earnings report. Prior to the February 2017 report, NVDA stock had run up 32% since the prior earnings report. After both the August and February 2017 reports, NVDA stock dropped. Consequently, it looks like NVDA earnings are a “sell the news” event this time around. I expect shares to drop in response to the quarterly numbers. My conviction in this is strengthened by looking at how Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stock dropped after its strong quarterly report.

NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) is an interesting player in the Technology space, with a focus on Semiconductor – Specialized. The stock has been active on the tape, currently trading at $207.20, up from yesterday’s close by 0.19%. Given the stock’s recent action, it seemed like a good time to take a closer look at the company’s recent data. Fundamental Analysis No amount of research is complete without a bird’s eye view of the financial data. NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) currently trades with a market capitalization of $120.52 Billion. That value represents a market adjusting for revenues that have been growing by 56.16 % on a quarterly year/year basis as of the company’s last quarterly report. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For NVDA, the company currently has $1.99 Billion of cash on the books, which is offset by $89 Million current liabilities. You can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $1.97 Billion over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to grow in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $0.94 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 66.63% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors. Technical Analysis We’ve taken a serious look at this stock from a fundamental perspective, but the tale of the tape may offer more hints about what lies under the surface. Looking at the stock’s movement on the chart, NVIDIA Corporation recorded a 52-week high of $207.89. It is now trading 0.69% off that level. The stock is trading $181.77 its 50-day moving average by -25.43%. The stock carved out a 52-week low down at $66.57. In recent action, NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) has made a move of +14.56% over the past month, which has come on weak relative transaction volume. Over the trailing year, the stock is underperforming the S&P 500 by 23.3, and it’s gotten there by action that has been more volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. In terms of the mechanics underlying that movement, traders will want to note that the stock is trading on a float of 2.56% with $573.18 Million sitting short, betting on future declines. That suggests something of the likelihood of a short squeeze in shares of NVDA. 

https://www.stocknewsgazette.com/2017/11/02/revisit-the-buy-and-hold-case-for-nvidia-corporation-nvda/

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) gained 1.46% in first day of the new month, going up from its prior closing price of $203.84 to $206.81, and has now recorded rally in 5 consecutive sessions. Many in the market will be closely watching whether this winning streak is sustainable or take a temporary pause for the next couple of trading sessions. The stock price went upward in 6 of the last 10 days and has generated 4.58% during the last two weeks. Trading activity decreased by -2.32 million shares, and in total, 10.25 M shares exchanged hands for about $2 120.34 million. It should be noted that increasing price and decreasing volume show lack of interest and this is a warning that something has fundamentally changed. Inside NVDA’s Recent Trend NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) lies in the upper part of a wide and strong rising trend in the short term, and this will normally pose a very good selling opportunity for the short-term trader as reaction back towards the lower part of the trend can be expected. A break-up at the top trend line at $210.08 will firstly indicate a stronger raising rate. Short-term traders are predicted to see a rally of 23.7% over the course of a quarter and, with 90% chance the price will be floating in the range of $231.27 and $259.87 in this timeframe. NVIDIA Corporation Technical Signals 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 NVDA has witnessed its long term and short term MA triggering a buy signal. Many traders watch for short-term averages to cross above long-term averages to signal the beginning of a uptrend. Upon corrections, the price will meet support from the averages between $199.59 and $187.16. A break down through these support points will trigger sell signals. Its pivot point low generated buy signal on Wednesday October 25, 2017, which calls for additional surge until the stock forms a new pivot point high. There was a decrease in volume but the price rose. This is usually not interpreted as a good sign as traders widely believe falling volume should see declining stock. Investors should be watching the price action like a hawk in the coming sessions. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Support And Resistance Levels In case of pullback, the next support the price will capture from accumulated volume will not be far away from current price at $187.55 and $180.11. It seems to be blessed by the accumulated volume as it meets no resistance above current level and favorable trading conditions will help the stock to show strong performance in the coming days. 
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 It is important to note, however, that the stock needs to make its way through natural risk while testing a key support level. Once this support is broken, another support level will be to be established at a lower level. Turning back to this stock, NVIDIA Corporation approaches the first support point just current price at $187.55. In case of a break, the next support we will see from accumulated volume is going to be at $180.11 and $155.96. NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Risk Assessment A volatility based measure Bollinger Bands suggests this stock poses high risk. In the most recent session, the stock price hovered around $2.99 between high and low, or 1.46%. The average volatility for the past week stood at 2.38%.

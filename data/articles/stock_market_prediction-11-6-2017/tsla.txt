Tesla’s earnings numbers were not welcome news for investors. Today, the company said it delivered 26,137 cars during the third quarter, but only 222 of those were Model 3s. That’s far below the 1,500 Tesla was hoping to have delivered by this time. Overall, the company posted a loss of $619 million on sales of $2.98 billion. Tesla shares dropped by as much as 5.4% on the news in after-hours trading, before recovering slightly. Overall, the company’s stock is up by about 50% for the year. Tesla CEO Elon Musk had warned there would be bumps in the road as Tesla entered “production hell” for the Model 3, and in August warned of “production bottlenecks.” In a Nov. 1 letter to investors (pdf), Tesla clarified that the primary production constraint is the battery module assembly line in its Gigafactory 1 outside Reno, Nevada. Tesla said it was redesigning two parts of the battery assembly process, “key elements of which were done by manufacturing systems suppliers,” to streamline its automated manufacturing process. Musk says he’s camping out at the factory until the problems are resolved. In describing the struggle to get manufacturing back on track, he made an allusion to the nine circles of hell in Dante Alighieri’s Inferno. “We were in level nine, and we’re now in level eight and close to exiting level eight,” said Musk, “I thought we’d be more like level seven. I was really depressed three or four weeks ago.” Musk said that Tesla’s reliance on a small number of robotic stations to automate construction of the vehicle, rather than human workers, means that any problems on the line can slow assembly dramatically. The company’s fortunes are riding on the Model 3, which has a base price of $35,00. Tesla is betting its first mass-market car will elevate it to become the first automaker to join America’s famous “Big 3” in more than 50 years. Tesla has already surpassed all of them in market value at one time (GM put Tesla back in second place earlier this year), but the electric carmaker has yet to prove its staying power.  So far, it’s been a rough ride. Musk must coordinate a sprawling supply and production chain, including two factories where cars are assembled in Fremont and the Gigafactory where Model 3 battery packs and drive units are made. Tesla notes that its manufacturing process is more automated than most carmakers, and therefore takes longer to establish. The company said it plans to make 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week by about March 2018 (a quarter later than initially predicted) and then 10,000 units per week sometime after that. The company has about $3.5 billion in cash entering the fourth quarter to make it happen.

 @FredericLambert After market close today, Tesla released its financial results and shareholders letter for the third quarter 2017. Wall Street was expecting record revenue of about $2.9 billion for the quarter and a loss of about $2.45 per share due to large capital expenditure caused by the slow start of Model 3 production. The company released the official results today delivering on revenue of ~$2.9 billion and missed on earnings with a loss of $3.70 per share (GAAP).

(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Here we will be posting our follow-up posts about the earnings to expand on the most important points (refresh the page to see the most recent posts): The shareholder letter has been embedded in full below. Tesla’s stock price was down 4% in aftermarket trading following the release of the results. The results compare to revenue of ~$2.8 billion and a loss of $2.04 per share (GAAP) during the previous quarter. Tesla slightly updated its record delivery results for Model S and Model X: “In Q3, we delivered 25,915 Model S and Model X vehicles and 222 Model 3 vehicles, for a total of 26,137 deliveries. Combined Model S and Model X deliveries in Q3 grew 18% globally compared to Q2 and 4.5% versus the same quarter one year ago. Consequently, both Model S and Model X gained further market share in the US luxury vehicle market. In addition, our used vehicle sales more than doubled from the prior quarter.” The company’s gross margin took a big hit: 18.3% down from 27.9% quarter-over-quarter. It is attributed to Model 3 production being extremely costly right now with little deliveries. Investors will be happy to know that Tesla is not planning another capital raise despite its wider losses: “Between cash on hand, future cash flows and available lines of credit, we believe that we are well capitalized to accommodate the revised ramp of Model 3 production to 5,000 per week. Upon achieving this production level, we expect to generate significant cash flows from operating activities.” Here’s the shareholder letter in full:

Tesla earnings (Shutterstock photo) Tesla (TSLA), which has ambitions of being more mainstream, will report third quarter fiscal 2017 earnings results after Wednesday's closing bell. But investors would feel much better if the luxury electric vehicle company had ambitions of being more profitable. Tesla shares have taken a massive beating over the past couple of weeks, falling as much as 18% from its all-time high of $386.99 reached in June to a recent low of $316.66 — the stock’s lowest level since early August. A combination of factors has impacted TSLA stock. But the biggest concern rests with Tesla’s money-making capabilities, particularly as it relates its highly-anticipated Model 3 sedan — the company’s first attempt at producing a mass market electric vehicle. Tesla reportedly spends some $80,000 to build each Model 3, which will retail for $35,000 — or about half the price of Tesla's next-cheapest car, the Model S. The company believes the lower price point would enable it to emerge from a niche market to better compete with Detroit heavyweights General Motors (GM) and Ford (F). On Wednesday the Street will want to get a sense of not only how realistic Tesla’s Model 3 delivery goals are, but also how much cash it will take to meet those goals. Earlier this month the company spooked investors when announcing that its third-quarter Model 3 delivery totals would be 220 vehicles. Though that marked a 4.5% increase year over year, it’s below the 1,260 vehicles analysts expected and well below the company’s year-end production targets of 20,000 Model 3s a month by December. On Friday analysts at Evercore downgraded TSLA stock from Buy to Neutral, advising their clients to be “more cautious” on Model 3 production. The Model 3 is “the most important piece of the Tesla investment story in coming quarters,” Evercore warned. In terms of overcoming production hiccups, which CEO Elon Musk recently described at “manufacturing hell,” Evercore noted, “We suspect that Tesla won’t have 100% visibility on the ramp until they hit more than 1,000 Model 3 units per week.” As such, the firm reduced its price target on TSLA stock to $312, from $330, implying a 3% downside to Friday’s closing price of $320.87. In the three months that ended September, Wall Street expects the Palo Alto, Calif.-based company to post a per-share loss of $2.29 on revenue of $2.94 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when the company lost 71 cents per share on $2.3 billion in revenue. For the full year, ending in December, the loss is expected to be $6.67 per share, compared to a loss of $2.87 a year ago, while full-year revenue of $11.84 billion would rise 69.2% year over year. All told, with the 1,000 Model 3 units per week benchmark expected to be reached toward the end of November, Tesla has a lot to prove Wednesday if it wants to keep its shares from driving in reverse. From my vantage point, however, these shares, which I now own, are not as risky as they were three months ago. I’ve said this before, Tesla’s main problem — if you can call it that — is that the company must overcome too much demand for its products. And that’s a business I want a piece of.

YouTube/iPhone-Fan  Tesla on Wednesday reported the largest quarterly loss in its history and said it was cutting production on two of its vehicle models. Here are the key third-quarter numbers (expectations via Bloomberg): The company said it planned to produce "about 10% fewer" units of its Model S and Model X models in the fourth quarter and reallocate resources to the Model 3, its newest. Tesla expects to hit a Model 3 production rate of 5,000 vehicles a week by late in the first quarter of 2018. "While we continue to make significant progress each week in fixing Model 3 bottlenecks, the nature of manufacturing challenges during a ramp such as this makes it difficult to predict exactly how long it will take for all bottlenecks to be cleared or when new ones will appear," Tesla said in its statement. Tesla said in October that it produced only 260 vehicles, well below its target of 1,500. CEO Elon Musk said the Model 3 was "deep in production hell." Tesla's negative free cash flow expanded to -$1.4 billion, more than analysts' forecast of -$1.2 billion. The company said it was working with organizations in Puerto Rico to provide solar panels following the devastation left by Hurricane Maria in late September. Installations of its energy-storage units rose 138% year over year in the third quarter, driven by the Powerwall, its at-home battery. Tesla shares fell as much as 5% in extended trading after the earnings release. Tesla has surged 51% this year through Wednesday's close, and its market cap at various points has surpassed those of rivals including Ford, Fiat Chrysler, and General Motors.

U.S. stock futures are mixed this morning, as Wall Street struggles for new highs heading into what could be a volatile week. House Republicans unveiled their tax plan this weekend to mixed reviews, and President Trump embarked on a tour of Asia in an effort to ostensibly reach a diplomatic solution on North Korea. However, many investors will be paying close attention to Trump’s comments on North Korea, which have been quite inflammatory in the past. Heading into the open, Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are up 0.12%, S&P 500 futures have risen 0.02% and Nasdaq-100 futures are up 0.07%. On the options front, volume remained brisk on Friday, with about 19.8 million calls and 15.7 million puts changing hands on the session. On the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio fell to 0.60, while the 10-day moving average held at 0.64. Taking a closer look at Friday’s options activity, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) call options gained considerable traction after the company saw non-iPhone sales rise 24%. Meanwhile, Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) options speculation surged as rumors hit that Broadcom Ltd (NASDAQ:AVGO) was planning a $100 billion-plus bid for the chipmaker. Finally, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) had its “production hell” quip thrown back in its face after poor third-quarter earnings.  Apple silenced quite a few bears last week when it beat third-quarter earnings expectations. While iPhone sales still remain below historical levels, the company banked on a 24% jump in non-iPhone sales, which came in at $23.1 billion on the quarter. Apple also set iPhone deliveries within expectations following the launch of the iPhone X last week. That said, some analysts were quick to point out that Wall Street’s expectations had fallen since the September iPhone 8 event, and that these lowered expectations were the only reason Apple was able to turn in an earnings beat. Options traders were happy with the results, however, as calls made up an above average 67% of Friday’s take, which came in at more than 1.4 million contracts. However, the November put/call open interest ratio of 0.80 indicates that there are still more than a few bears betting that AAPL stock is due for a pullback. In fact, put OI has ballooned to more than 15,500 contracts at the $165 strike, with another 40,000 at the Nov $160 strike.

Latest evolution in the price of Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock has been one of the most talked about matter among the interested investors. It is widely believed that a stock’s future performance can best be predicted by analyzing prior trends and patterns in price. In the case of TSLA, the chart has some interesting things to say about where the stock might be headed in the future. How has the stock performed recently? Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in the last month has decreased -14.23%. Shares are now up over the past year, outperforming the broad market by -100% and underperformed a peer group of similar companies by -10%. After the latest session, which saw the stock close at a price of $306.09, TSLA sits below its 52-week high. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) has been trading in a bullish manner, based on the relative positions of the stock’s 20 and 200 day moving averages. Momentum indicators 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that TSLA may be headed in the future. In order to predict this, technical analysts look at momentum indicators, which measure the speed and magnitude of these price movements. The idea is that as momentum slows, it may signal the approach of key support or resistance levels and a reversal of recent trends. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for TSLA is 36.02%, which suggests that the stock is not particularly expensive or cheap, and not predisposed to a reactive price movement based on this measure. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 12.70%, tells a different story, and suggests that TSLA currently trades in oversold territory. What do the trading volumes reveal? Price isn’t the only tool analysts use to forecast future performance. Volume patterns can also reveal some important insights. If, for instance, a stock’s volumes suddenly increase by a significant amount, it’s usually a sign that the level of conviction behind the trade is high. Investors may feel very strongly about the future direction of the stock in question. Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) average trading volume of 6,405,215 during the past month is 1.34% below its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been less active than usual in the stock in recent times. What do the analysts think? TSLA is currently undervalued by -5.38% relative to the average 1-year price target of $323.48 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 2.80, which implies that analysts are generally neutral in their outlook for TSLA over the next year. How risky is the stock?  When analyzing a stock’s price performance, it’s essential to take risk into account. Beta, which measures a stock’s volatility relative to the overall market, can be used to gauge the level of systematic risk associated with a particular stock. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) has a beta of 1.02, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are more extreme than the market as a whole. TSLA therefore has a above average level of market risk. During the past couple of weeks, TSLA average daily volatility was 41.19%, which is -2.88 percentage points higher than the average volatility over the past 100 days.

Shares of Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE:UA) observed rebound of 1.63% since bottoming out on Nov. 02, 2017. Meanwhile, due to an ongoing pressure which caused a decline of almost -26.46% in the past five days, the stock price is now down -57.93% so far on the year — still in weak territory. In this case, shares are down -64.14% , the 52-week high touched on Dec. 09, 2016, but are collecting gains at -58.14% for the past 12 months.  Brokerage houses, on average, are recommending investors to sell Under Armour, Inc. (UA)’s shares projecting a $18 target price. Analysts‟ target price forecasts are a prediction of a stock‟s future price, generally over the 12 months following the release date (Asquith et al., 2005). This forecast is a point estimate that provides investors with a benchmark against which to directly compare stock price in the short run.Target prices made by analysts employed by large brokers, who have access to a greater resource pool, are more likely to be met over the 12-month forecast period.  UA’s revenue has declined at an average annualized rate of about 0% during the past five years. However, the company’s most recent quarter increase of 8.7% looks attractive. The sales growth rate for a stock is a measure of how the stock’s sales per share (SPS) has grown over a specific period of time. It tells an investor how quickly a company is increasing its revenues. The sales growth rate helps investors determine how strong the overall growth-orientation is for a stock or portfolio.   The best measure of a company is its profitability, for without it, it cannot grow, and if it doesn’t grow, then its stock will trend downward. Increasing profits are the best indication that a company can pay dividends and that the share price will trend upward. Creditors will loan money at a cheaper rate to a profitable company than to an unprofitable one; consequently, profitable companies can use leverage to increase stockholders’ equity even more. Profitability ratios compare different accounts to see how efficiently a business is generating profits. These ratios show how well income is generated through operations, and are important to both creditors and investors. They help determine the company’s ability to continue operating. Currently, Under Armour, Inc. net profit margin for the 12 months is at 2.91%. Comparatively, the peers have a net margin 5.85%, and the sector’s average is 13.97%. In that light, it seems in weak position compared to its peers and sector. The profit margin measures the amount of net income earned with each dollar’s worth of revenue. It shows the percentage of sales that remain after all of the company’s expenses have been paid. The higher the ratio, the better.  Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is another stock that is grabbing investors attention these days. Its shares have trimmed -21.44% since hitting a peak level on Sep. 18, 2017. Meanwhile, due to a recent pullback which led to a fall of almost -13.86% in the past one month, the stock price is now outperforming with 43.24% so far on the year — still in strong zone. In this case, shares are 71.78% higher, the worst price in 52 weeks suffered on Nov. 14, 2016, but are collecting gains at -0.36% for the past six months.  The good news is there’s still room for Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) to grow. At recent closing price of $306.09, TSLA has a chance to add $17.39 or 5.68% in 52 weeks, based on mean target price ($323.48) placed by analysts.The analyst consensus opinion of 2.8 looks like a hold. It has a 36-month beta of 1.02 , so you might be in for a bumpy ride.  For the past 5 years, Tesla, Inc.’s EPS growth has been nearly -13.1%. Sure, the percentage is discouraging but better times are ahead as looking out over a next 5-year period, analysts expect the company to see its earnings go up by 35%, annually.  Tesla, Inc. (TSLA)’s ROE is -38.08%, while industry’s is 13.54%. The average ROE for the sector stands at 13.14%. The return on equity (ROE), also known as return on investment (ROI), is the best measure of the return, since it is the product of the operating performance, asset turnover, and debt-equity management of the firm. If a firm can borrow money and use it to achieve a higher return than the cost of the debt, then the leveraging creates additional revenue that accrues to stockholders as increased equity.  Tesla, Inc.’s ROA is -8.3%, while industry’s average is 6.73%. As with any return, the higher this number the better. However, it, too, needs to be taken into the context of a company’s peer group as well as its sector. The average return on assets for companies in the same sector is 6.69. The return on assets (ROA) (aka return on total assets, return on average assets), is one of the most widely used profitability ratios because it is related to both profit margin and asset turnover, and shows the rate of return for both creditors and investors of the company. ROA shows how well a company controls its costs and utilizes its resources.

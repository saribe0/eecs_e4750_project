Down 1-0 to No. 1 University of Chicago, on the road with under 23 minutes left, the Washington University women’s soccer team’s dream of a third straight UAA title looked dead. Just 41 seconds later, they were more alive than ever, rejuvenated by a pair of scores that sent the Bears to a sensational 2-1 coup of another conference championship. In the most thrilling chapter of the Bears-Maroons rivalry to date, the Red and Green extended their unparalleled dominance of Chicago, seizing a seventh consecutive head-to-head win Saturday at Stagg Field. Four times the Maroons have been ranked, and four times Wash. U. has faced a road test; this time, in the toughest battle yet, the Bears survived, making it 11-2 in the stretch. Junior Darcy Cunningham dribbles the ball past Millikin in the bears impressive 5-0 win in September. Womens soccer won their last game at #1 Chicago 2-1, and continue to the NCAA Selection Show on Monday. Wash. U. faced a daunting task coming in, with the Maroons outscoring their opposition 65-4 entering the game, including 31 unanswered goals. The Red and Green defense was similarly potent, allowing just five goals total prior to the showdown. The two defenses understandably dictated the pace: The game started slow, with only two shots taken between the teams in the first 15 minutes. Neither offense could create opportunities against the other’s stellar back line. In the 17th minute though, Chicago struck, firing a 25-yard free kick into the upper left corner to give the Maroons an early lead. After that, both attacks woke up, exchanging shots throughout the remainder of the half. Both teams narrowly missed key opportunities: A promising header by sophomore forward Taylor Cohen went wide off the net in the 33rd minute, then Chicago’s own header ricocheted off the post to keep the score at 1-0. Towards the end of the half, Wash. U.’s offense began to exert more control over the flow of the game, taking the last four shots before the break. At one point, senior forward Mariana Alisio regained Wash. U. possession after a shot, but her attempt went just left of the goal. The half concluded with Chicago leading, 1-0, but the Bears showing positive signs with a commanding 9-4 lead in attempts. The second half saw the Red and Green continue their momentum from the end of the first and realize some of the opportunities they had been unable to finish earlier. After two quick shots by Cohen in the first five minutes, freshman forward Ellie DeConinck placed a shot on goal in the 52nd minute, which was saved by the Chicago goalkeeper.  Though the Maroon keeper fantastically kept her team ahead, the Bear barrage kept coming. Over a span of two minutes beginning in the 61st, Cohen, junior midfielder Maggie Crist and senior midfielder Mia Mastroianni all took great shots that were saved.  But in the 68th minute, the Bears finally broke through in a big way. Junior midfielder Darcy Cunningham sent a beautiful shot from 25 yards out over the keeper and into the back of the net to tie the game. After the score, DeConinck re-entered the game after a brief break. Within 41 seconds, she got away from the defense for a breakaway opportunity off a feed from Cunningham and Cohen and converted the shot to give Wash. U. a stunning, decisive 2-1 lead. Both teams continued to fight for the UAA crown until the very end. In the 83rd minute, freshman goalkeeper Emma Greenfield saved what would be the final shot by Chicago to cement the comeback win. The victory was an all-around extraordinary effort. The Red and Green offense was clicking, taking 10 more shots than the Maroons and offering more than twice as many shots on goal. The defense also performed well, denying chances for extended stretches of time while also turning miscues into opportunities when chances presented themselves. Greenfield made key saves that helped keep the game from getting away from the Bears in the first half and sealed the victory in the second half. The two teams claimed a share of the UAA title with identical 6-1 conference records. It marks the fifth in six years for head coach Jim Conlon’s Bears. Wash. U. received the UAA’s automatic bid for this year’s NCAA Tournament and will begin competing later this month. With the regular season complete, the Selection Show will take place Monday at noon.

 The nation's 12th-ranked Division I women's basketball team clobbered the nation's fourth-ranked Division II team Sunday, but the Duke Blue Devils couldn't stop UAA's Hannah Wandersee.  A 6-foot-1 junior from Kodiak, Wandersee had the best game of her college career in UAA's 87-56 exhibition loss at Cameron Indoor Stadium in Durham, North Carolina.  She put up the second double-double of her career — 19 point and 10 rebounds — and blocked four shots.  "We have been waiting for a breakout game from her like this," UAA coach Ryan McCarthy said in a press release from UAA. "(W)e just didn't realize it would come against Duke at Cameron Indoor Stadium."  Wandersee connected on 9 of 16 shots from the field and added two steals to lead the Seawolves, who got in trouble early.  Duke raced to a 10-0 lead, a burst that began with a wide-open 3-pointer by Lexie Brown, a two-time All-America guard. A 5-9 senior, Brown poured in 27 points on 10-of-17 shooting, with many of her points coming in transition.  Duke's speed and size proved fatal to the Seawolves, who surrendered 20 fast-break points and were outrebounded 48-34.  UAA responded to Duke's fast start with a 3-pointer by Shelby Cloninger and a jumper by Sydni Stallworth to make it 10-5, but the Blue Devils led 26-13 at the end of the first quarter and 49-28 at the half.  "This was a tremendous opportunity for us to test ourselves against incredible athletes at the highest level of our sport," McCarthy said. "I'm really proud of the effort our ladies showed today – they did not back down an inch. Hannah's effort was especially impressive."  Wandersee's only other double-double came in her freshman season when she posted 22 points and 11 rebounds against New Hope Christian, an Oregon school that belongs to the National Christian College Athletic Association.  Cloninger hit three of her six shots behind the arc to finish with 11 points for the Seawolves, who also got five points, four rebounds, four assists and two steals from Rodericka Ware.  Rebecca Greenwell, Brown's backcourt mate, dropped in 20 points to go with seven rebounds, six assists and five steals for the Blue Devils.  The Seawolves play their first games against Division II opponents this week at the Wildcat Crossover Tournament in Ellensburg, Washington. UAA faces Hawaii Pacific at 11 a.m. AST Friday and Cal State Los Angeles at noon AST Saturday.

Wednesday night, the Washington University women’s volleyball team had dinner with former Bears head coach Teri Clemens. Just a week earlier, Wash. U. had been one of the hottest teams in Division III, having won 10 straight contests. But the Red and Green had lived up to their name: The tides turned quickly when a loss to DePauw University not only ended the streak, but leaked into three straight losses. Sophomore Lauren Fournier digs the ball in the bears’ 3-0 win against Transylvania in October. Bears volleyball defeated Emory on Saturday with a 3-1 victory, and will play at the NCAA selection show on November 6th. With the UAA Championships right around the corner, the Bears needed to get their act together. A win against Greenville University helped, but it was meeting with Clemens, who served 14 years at the helm, totaling seven national championships and a 136-1 conference record, that sparked their best weekend of the year. “She really got us fired up,” sophomore setter Chloe Stile said. “She told us that we could crush everyone in the UAA and that’s what she expected of us. But it also didn’t matter what the scoreboard said but how we felt after the game and knowing that we gave it our all. I think that really inspired a lot of us.” Current head coach Vanessa Walby saw the same effects. “I think spending time with Teri was helpful,” Walby said. “I think the underclassmen are still trying to learn the history and traditions that is Bear volleyball. Seeing it firsthand for all of the girls was very special. Teri built what we have here and it is special and awesome to be a part of.” The Bears proceeded to sweep the UAA Championships, with commanding wins over New York University, No. 20 University of Chicago and No. 7 Emory University to clinch their 22nd conference title this weekend in the Woodruff P.E. Center in Atlanta. During the three-game losing streak, the team’s cohesion wasn’t the same as it had been during most of the regular season. After meeting with Clemens and defeating Greenville, the team made adjustments—but they weren’t tactical changes, according to Stile. “A lot of it was that we really came together as a team over the weekend,” Stile said. “During those three games at the end of the season, we were playing more like individuals…It was mostly mental; it wasn’t so much physical adjustments.” Walby saw the same effects, citing that the team “regrouped” as everyone was given a “clean slate” after the three games heading into the UAA conference tournament. The team set the tone with a 3-0 beatdown of NYU in its opening match. After winning the first set 25-13, the Bears held on for a tight 25-21 victory in the second set. Demoralized, New York’s energy was zapped and the Bears took advantage, closing with a powerful 25-9 set to complete the sweep. Wash. U. finished with 47 kills to NYU’s 29, while posting a hitting percentage of 38. Junior middle hitter Julianne Malek and freshman outside hitter Tricia Brown tied for a team-high 10 kills, while freshman setter Kirby Knapp had a team-high 24 assists and sophomore defensive specialist Zoe Baxter totaled a team-high 12 digs. The Bears fed off that momentum to knock off Chicago in three sets. Once again, the Bears totaled more kills, hitting 50 to Chicago’s 37. It was junior outside hitter Ifeoma Ufondu who led the way, notching 20 kills, tying her highest mark all year, on a 41 hitting percentage. Stile had a team-high 22 assists while Baxter and the team’s lone senior, defensive specialist Lauren Fournier, had a team-high 13 digs. Once again, Wash. U. found itself in the championship match with Emory. Historically, that’s par for the course—11 of the last 14 times and the six most recent times the Red and Green have seized the UAA title, it’s been against the Eagles. The Bears fought to win a tight 25-23 first set, but lost their first set of the weekend, 25-17, in the next. The Bears showed resiliency, winning back-to-back sets 25-16 and 25-17, respectively, to close the deal and capture the title. Malek again led the team in kills with 14 and a hitting percentage of 54. Knapp totaled 20 assists while Baxter had 21 digs. “I would prefer to say as a team it was a great team weekend,” Walby said. “That was our emphasis.” The Bears now have a guaranteed spot in the NCAA Tournament, but will have to wait until Monday’s Selection Show to see where they’re placed. They will have a viewing show as a team when the results come out at 11:30 a.m. “I am really excited that we have the automatic qualifier,” Walby said. “That takes a lot of stress off. Now we wait to see if we host or are traveling.” The Bears will try to replicate their run last year and make it back to the NCAA Championship, channeling a little Teri Clemens, just as they did this weekend.

Analyst ratings can sometimes be complicated, and we here at ETF Channel have noticed a bit of a paradox with Under Armour Inc (Symbol: UAA). The average 12-month price target for UAA - averaging the work of 25 analysts - reveals an average price target of $13.78/share. That's a whopping 18.69% above where UAA has been trading recently at $11.61/share. With this kind of capital gain potential (should UAA reach that price target), one might expect to see a high concentration of "buy" or even "strong buy" ratings on the stock. Yet, take a look at the bearishness:     10 ETFs With Most Upside To Analyst Targets »

Consistently, one of the more popular stocks people enter into their stock options watchlist at Stock Options Channel is Exxon Mobil Corp (Symbol: XOM). So this week we highlight one interesting put contract, and one interesting call contract, from the January 2018 expiration for XOM. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting, is at the $80 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of 88 cents. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 1.1% return against the $80 commitment, or a 5.4% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost ).      Turning to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the January 2018 expiration, for shareholders of Exxon Mobil Corp (Symbol: XOM) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 3.7% annualized dividend yield. Selling the covered call at the $85 strike and collecting the premium based on the $1.02 bid, annualizes to an additional 6% rate of return against the current stock price (this is what we at Stock Options Channel refer to as the YieldBoost ), for a total of 9.7% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $85 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but XOM shares would have to advance 1.7% from current levels for that to occur, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 3% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.

Over the last few days fluctuation in the stock of Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) was the main talking point of investors. It is widely believed that a stock’s future performance can best be predicted by analyzing prior trends and patterns in price. In the case of XOM, the chart has some interesting things to say about where the stock might be headed in the future. How has the stock performed recently? Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) in the last month has increased +1.80%. Shares are now up over the past year, outperforming the broad market by -100% and underperformed a peer group of similar companies by -98%. After the latest session, which saw the stock close at a price of $83.18, XOM sits below its 52-week high. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has been trading in a bullish manner, based on the relative positions of the stock’s 20 and 200 day moving averages. Momentum indicators 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that XOM may be headed in the future. To do this, analysts often study the speed and magnitude of a stock’s price movements with what are known as momentum indicators. The logic is that as a stock’s momentum slows, it may be nearing key support or resistance levels and possibly the end of a current trend. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for XOM is 60.03%, which suggests that the stock is not particularly expensive or cheap, and not predisposed to a reactive price movement based on this measure. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 73.27%, tells a different story, and suggests that XOM currently trades in overbought territory. What do the trading volumes reveal? Volume patterns can also be useful for predicting future performance. When trading activity is abnormally high, it’s often a sign that the market feels particularly strong in one way or another about the future direction of a stock. Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) average trading volume of 8,192,646 during the past month is 25.27% below its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been less active than usual in the stock in recent times. What do the analysts think? XOM is currently undervalued by -0.89% relative to the average 1-year price target of $83.93 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 3.00, which implies that analysts are generally neutral in their outlook for XOM over the next year. How risky is the stock?  No study on the valuation of a stock is complete without taking into account risk. When analyzing the systematic risk associated with a stock, analysts look at beta, which measures the stock’s volatility relative to the overall market. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has a beta of 0.82, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are less extreme than the market as a whole. XOM therefore has a below average level of market risk. During the past couple of weeks, XOM average daily volatility was 5.26%, which is 4.39 percentage points lower than the average volatility over the past 100 days.

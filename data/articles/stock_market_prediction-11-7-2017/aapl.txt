 AAPL  Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report)	 stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Apple has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18.9, as you can see in the chart below:  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 20.7. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts Apple’s current PE ratio marginally somewhat above its midpoint (which is 13.4) over the past five years.  Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 23.9. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.  We should also point out that Apple has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 15.7, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Apple’s stock in the near term too.P/CF RatioAn often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price/cash flow metric. This ratio doesn’t take amortization and depreciation into account, so can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business. This is a preferred metric to some valuation investors because cash flows are (a) generally less prone to manipulation by the company’s management and (b) are less affected by variation in accounting policies between different companies.The ratio is generally applied to find out whether a company’s stock is overpriced or underpriced with reference to its cash flows generation potential compared with its competitors. However, it is not commonly used for cross-industry comparison, as the average price to cash flow ratio varies from industry to industry.In this case, Apple’s P/CF ratio of 15.4 is higher than the industry average of 12.9, which indicates that the stock is somewhat overvalued in this respect.  Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Apple currently has a Value Style Score of ‘B’, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes AAPL a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Apple is just 1.4, a level that is noticeably lower than the industry average of 3.2. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Clearly, AAPL is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Apple might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of F and a Momentum score of A. This gives AAPL a VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of C. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging. The current quarter has seen four estimates go higher in the past sixty days and four lower, while the full year estimate has seen six upward and four downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a favorable impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen about 3.5% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has increased approximately 3.3%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below: Apple Inc. Price and Consensus     Apple Inc. Price and Consensus | Apple Inc. Quote The stock holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which indicates expectations of in-line performance from the company in the near term. However, Apple is enjoying bullish analyst sentiment, as indicated by the positive estimate revisions, and this works in the company’s favor.Bottom LineApple is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (bottom 22% out of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. Nonetheless, over the past one year, the sector has clearly outperformed the broader market, as you can see below:  So, value investors might want to wait for the broader factors to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.

How much will cost to replace a damaged iPhone X? The short answer: up to more than half the cost of buying a new device, according to Statista.  Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL)'s iPhone X starts at $999 for a base model 64GB device and moves up in price for higher storage. This makes the iPhone X the most expensive iPhone to date, yet it appears that demand for the phone outpaces supply. Apple began accepting pre-orders for the iPhone X last week and it sold out within minutes. The estimated delivery time now stands at five to six weeks. The lucky few who will have an iPhone X in their hands in a few weeks' time are naturally cautioned not to drop or break the phone, because it will be pricey. Apple's official screen repair service for the iPhone X will cost consumers $279, and damage beyond the screen will set consumers back $549, Statista said. By comparison, a screen repair for the iPhone 8 Plus costs $169, and $399 if damage extends beyond the screen. The cheapest screen to repair is the iPhone SE at $129, or $269 for extensive damage.  You will find more statistics at Statista.

U.S. stock futures are mixed this morning, as Wall Street struggles for new highs heading into what could be a volatile week. House Republicans unveiled their tax plan this weekend to mixed reviews, and President Trump embarked on a tour of Asia in an effort to ostensibly reach a diplomatic solution on North Korea. However, many investors will be paying close attention to Trump’s comments on North Korea, which have been quite inflammatory in the past. Heading into the open, Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are up 0.12%, S&P 500 futures have risen 0.02% and Nasdaq-100 futures are up 0.07%. On the options front, volume remained brisk on Friday, with about 19.8 million calls and 15.7 million puts changing hands on the session. On the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio fell to 0.60, while the 10-day moving average held at 0.64. Taking a closer look at Friday’s options activity, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) call options gained considerable traction after the company saw non-iPhone sales rise 24%. Meanwhile, Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) options speculation surged as rumors hit that Broadcom Ltd (NASDAQ:AVGO) was planning a $100 billion-plus bid for the chipmaker. Finally, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) had its “production hell” quip thrown back in its face after poor third-quarter earnings.  Apple silenced quite a few bears last week when it beat third-quarter earnings expectations. While iPhone sales still remain below historical levels, the company banked on a 24% jump in non-iPhone sales, which came in at $23.1 billion on the quarter. Apple also set iPhone deliveries within expectations following the launch of the iPhone X last week. That said, some analysts were quick to point out that Wall Street’s expectations had fallen since the September iPhone 8 event, and that these lowered expectations were the only reason Apple was able to turn in an earnings beat. Options traders were happy with the results, however, as calls made up an above average 67% of Friday’s take, which came in at more than 1.4 million contracts. However, the November put/call open interest ratio of 0.80 indicates that there are still more than a few bears betting that AAPL stock is due for a pullback. In fact, put OI has ballooned to more than 15,500 contracts at the $165 strike, with another 40,000 at the Nov $160 strike.

Apple also set iPhone deliveries within expectations following the launch of the iPhone X last week. That said, some analysts were quick to point out that Wall Street’s expectations had fallen since the September iPhone 8 event, and that these lowered expectations were the only reason Apple was able to turn in an earnings beat. Options traders were happy with the results, however, as calls made up an above average 67% of Friday’s take, which came in at more than 1.4 million contracts. However, the November put/call open interest ratio of 0.80 indicates that there are still more than a few bears betting that AAPL stock is due for a pullback. In fact, put OI has ballooned to more than 15,500 contracts at the $165 strike, with another 40,000 at the Nov $160 strike.

Consistently, one of the more popular stocks people enter into their stock options watchlist at Stock Options Channel is Apple Inc (Symbol: AAPL). So this week we highlight one interesting put contract, and one interesting call contract, from the February 2018 expiration for AAPL. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting, is at the $160 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $3.45. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 2.2% return against the $160 commitment, or a 7.7% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost ).      Turning to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the February 2018 expiration, for shareholders of Apple Inc (Symbol: AAPL) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 1.4% annualized dividend yield. Selling the covered call at the $190 strike and collecting the premium based on the $3.35 bid, annualizes to an additional 6.9% rate of return against the current stock price (this is what we at Stock Options Channel refer to as the YieldBoost ), for a total of 8.3% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $190 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but AAPL shares would have to advance 9% from current levels for that to happen, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 10.9% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.

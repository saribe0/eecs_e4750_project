Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT) is an interesting player in the Technology space, with a focus on Semiconductor Equipment & Materials. The stock has been active on the tape, currently trading at $56.43, up from yesterday’s close by 0.95%. Given the stock’s recent action, it seemed like a good time to take a closer look at the company’s recent data. Fundamental Analysis No amount of research is complete without a bird’s eye view of the financial data. Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT) currently trades with a market capitalization of $60.44 Billion. That value represents a market adjusting for revenues that have been growing by 32.72 % on a quarterly year/year basis as of the company’s last quarterly report. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For AMAT, the company currently has $5.28 Billion of cash on the books. You can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $3.4 Billion over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to hold steady in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $0.91 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 81.91% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors. Technical Analysis No analysis is ever complete without a thorough survey of a stock’s technical behavior. Looking at the stock’s movement on the chart, Applied Materials, Inc. recorded a 52-week high of $56.82. It is now trading 0.39% off that level. The stock is trading $49.73 its 50-day moving average by -6.7%. The stock carved out a 52-week low down at $28.02. In recent action, Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT) has made a move of +8.85% over the past month, which has come on weak relative transaction volume. Over the trailing year, the stock is underperforming the S&P 500 by 22.64, and it’s gotten there by action that has been more volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. In terms of the mechanics underlying that movement, traders will want to note that the stock is trading on a float of 1.44% with $1.06 Billion sitting short, betting on future declines. That suggests something of the likelihood of a short squeeze in shares of AMAT. 

https://stocknewsgazette.com/2017/10/30/dissecting-the-numbers-for-applied-materials-inc-amat-and-teradyne-inc-ter/

Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) shares are up more than 75.67% this year and recently increased 1.36% or $0.76 to settle at $56.69. Teradyne, Inc. (NYSE:TER), on the other hand, is up 68.27% year to date as of 10/27/2017. It currently trades at $42.74 and has returned 9.28% during the past week. Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) and Teradyne, Inc. (NYSE:TER) are the two most active stocks in the Semiconductor Equipment & Materials industry based on today’s trading volumes. The market is clearly enthusiastic about both these stocks, but which is the better investment? To answer this, we will compare the two companies based on the strength of their growth, profitability, risk, returns, valuation, analyst recommendations, and insider trends. Growth Companies that can consistently grow earnings at a high compound rate usually have the greatest potential to create value for shareholders in the long-run. Analysts expect AMAT to grow earnings at a 28.63% annual rate over the next 5 years. Comparatively, TER is expected to grow at a 21.80% annual rate. All else equal, AMAT’s higher growth rate would imply a greater potential for capital appreciation. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Profitability and Returns Growth isn’t very attractive to investors if companies are sacrificing profitability and shareholder returns to achieve that growth. We will use EBITDA margin and Return on Investment (ROI), which control for differences in capital structure between the two companies, to measure profitability and return., compared to an EBITDA margin of 27.58% for Teradyne, Inc. (TER). AMAT’s ROI is 17.30% while TER has a ROI of -2.20%. The interpretation is that AMAT’s business generates a higher return on investment than TER’s. Cash Flow  
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Cash is king when it comes to investing. AMAT’s free cash flow (“FCF”) per share for the trailing twelve months was +1.09. Comparatively, TER’s free cash flow per share was +1.34. On a percent-of-sales basis, AMAT’s free cash flow was 10.74% while TER converted 15.12% of its revenues into cash flow. This means that, for a given level of sales, TER is able to generate more free cash flow for investors. Liquidity and Financial Risk Balance sheet risk is one of the biggest factors to consider before investing. AMAT has a current ratio of 2.90 compared to 4.70 for TER. This means that TER can more easily cover its most immediate liabilities over the next twelve months. AMAT’s debt-to-equity ratio is 0.61 versus a D/E of 0.18 for TER. AMAT is therefore the more solvent of the two companies, and has lower financial risk. Valuation AMAT trades at a forward P/E of 15.51, a P/B of 6.96, and a P/S of 4.38, compared to a forward P/E of 19.19, a P/B of 4.15, and a P/S of 4.17 for TER. AMAT is the cheaper of the two stocks on an earnings basis but is expensive in terms of P/B and P/S ratio. Given that earnings are what matter most to investors, analysts tend to place a greater weight on the P/E. Analyst Price Targets and Opinions When investing it’s crucial to distinguish between price and value. As Warren Buffet said, “price is what you pay, value is what you get”. AMAT is currently priced at a -5.36% to its one-year price target of 59.90. Comparatively, TER is 0.8% relative to its price target of 42.40. This suggests that AMAT is the better investment over the next year. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 1.80 for AMAT and 2.10 for TER, which implies that analysts are more bullish on the outlook for TER. Risk and Volatility Beta is an important measure that gives investors a sense of the market risk associated with a particular stock. A beta above 1 signals above average market risk, while a beta below 1 implies below average volatility. AMAT has a beta of 1.83 and TER’s beta is 1.01. TER’s shares are therefore the less volatile of the two stocks. Insider Activity and Investor Sentiment Comparing the number of shares sold short to the float is a method analysts often use to get a reading on investor sentiment. AMAT has a short ratio of 1.46 compared to a short interest of 3.40 for TER. This implies that the market is currently less bearish on the outlook for AMAT. Summary Teradyne, Inc. (NYSE:TER) beats Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) on a total of 7 of the 14 factors compared between the two stocks. TER is growing fastly, has a higher cash conversion rate, higher liquidity and has lower financial risk. In terms of valuation, TER is the cheaper of the two stocks on book value and sales basis, Finally, RPM has better sentiment signals based on short interest.

After staying quite for a long time Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) shares have recently been behaving interestingly to keep investors awake. Many analysts use price trends and patterns to predict future performance, and we can glean some important insights about AMAT by examining the chart. How has the stock performed recently? Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) in the last month has increased +8.85%. Shares are now up over the past year, outperforming the broad market by -100% and outperformed a peer group of similar companies by 141%. After the latest session, which saw the stock close at a price of $56.43, AMAT sits below its 52-week high. Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) has been trading in a bullish manner, based on the relative positions of the stock’s 20 and 200 day moving averages. Momentum indicators 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that AMAT may be headed in the future. If we want to get a sense of AMAT’s future performance, we have to look at the speed and size of these price movements. Using what are known as momentum indicators, we can use the stock’s price momentum to get a sense of whether the stock is in the midst of, or nearing the end of, a current trend. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for AMAT is 69.53%, which suggests that the stock is not particularly expensive or cheap, and not predisposed to a reactive price movement based on this measure. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 92.07%, tells a different story, and suggests that AMAT currently trades in overbought territory. What do the trading volumes reveal? In addition to price, analysts use volume trends to predict future performance. The level of trading activity in a stock is often a good proxy for the level of interest and enthusiasm for the name within the investment community. A sudden increase in activity can be a sign that investors are trading in anticipation of a catalyst. Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT) average trading volume of 9,402,280 during the past month is 4.93% below its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been less active than usual in the stock in recent times. What do the analysts think? AMAT is currently undervalued by -5.79% relative to the average 1-year price target of $59.90 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 1.80, which implies that analysts are generally bullish in their outlook for AMAT over the next year. How risky is the stock?  Absolute price performance isn’t the only thing analysts consider when predicting future performance: volatility matters as well. Beta, which measures the stock’s volatility relative to the overall market, is a simple but effective metric for assessing risk. Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) has a beta of 1.83, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are more extreme than the market as a whole. AMAT therefore has a above average level of market risk. During the past couple of weeks, AMAT average daily volatility was 16.23%, which is 12.11 percentage points lower than the average volatility over the past 100 days.

 Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that AMAT may be headed in the future. Fortunately, there is way to use the speed and magnitude of these price changes to predict future performance, thanks to what are known as momentum indicators. As momentum slows, it might be a sign that a support or resistance level has been reached, and that a trend is about to reverse. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for AMAT is 67.77%, which suggests that the stock is not particularly expensive or cheap, and not predisposed to a reactive price movement based on this measure. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 81.17%, tells a different story, and suggests that AMAT currently trades in overbought territory. What do the trading volumes reveal? Volume patterns can also be useful for predicting future performance. When trading activity is abnormally high, it’s often a sign that the market feels particularly strong in one way or another about the future direction of a stock. Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT) average trading volume of 9,224,880 during the past month is 6.49% below its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been less active than usual in the stock in recent times. What do the analysts think? AMAT is currently undervalued by -5.59% relative to the average 1-year price target of $59.90 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 1.80, which implies that analysts are generally bullish in their outlook for AMAT over the next year. How risky is the stock?  When analyzing a stock’s price performance, it’s essential to take risk into account. Beta, which measures a stock’s volatility relative to the overall market, can be used to gauge the level of systematic risk associated with a particular stock. Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) has a beta of 1.84, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are more extreme than the market as a whole. AMAT therefore has a above average level of market risk. During the past couple of weeks, AMAT average daily volatility was 16.02%, which is 11.48 percentage points lower than the average volatility over the past 100 days.

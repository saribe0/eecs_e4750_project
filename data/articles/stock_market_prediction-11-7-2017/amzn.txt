Source: Shutterstock Shares of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) have been on fire this year. The AMZN stock price is up 47% so far in 2017, a massive move for a now $532 billion company. For investors that have missed the move last week, there’s still a chance to get long this premier tech stock. With shares up this big, some investors feel they’ve missed the move. That feeling is understandable. I wish I had just bought Amazon stock, Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) five or ten years ago and left it at that. In any regard, there are a few catalysts left for Amazon despite this year’s massive move. For starters, the broad-based market rally has no end in sight. And I don’t say that as a blind bull. In truth, I haven’t been bullish enough. I’ve spent too much time in cash (although it’s admittedly comforting) and have pared back my winners by too much — in names like Visa Inc (NYSE:V) and Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA), specifically. From the looks of it though, any blip in the market will be bought ferociously. Investors pounce on 1% and 2% pullbacks, thus the market has now set a record for the longest stretch without a 3% pullback. That goes for the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY) and SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSEARCA:DIA). For market leaders like Amazon, investors are the same way. They want to be a part of the cloud and the commerce revolution. It helps that we’re coming into November. The holiday season should kickstart the buying appetite in the stock market, especially in an economy and market like this. Heading into the season where Amazon, eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) and others do a bulk of their business, why shouldn’t investors be excited about them? Prior to reporting earnings in late-October, Amazon had been bumbling along, actually down 6.5% in the three months prior and up just 7% in the prior six months. Remarkably unimpressive gains for a stock that’s up almost 50% on the year. That shows us that AMZN stock has been consolidating for the better part of six months. That in itself is bullish, as it has a longer base to project higher from. Even though expectations fell over the past 12 months, analysts were looking for earnings of just 3 cents per share going into the quarter. Amazon blew it away, reporting 52 cents per share. Sales of $43.74 billion came in $1.6 billion ahead of expectations and up 33.7% year-over-year. Its midpoint of fourth-quarter revenue guidance more or less hit analysts’ expectations. As a quick note, this is really impressive sales growth for a $530 billion market cap company. But Alibaba Holding Group Ltd (NYSE:BABA) just reported 60% sales growth this quarter and has a $475 billion market cap. That’s one reason why we are long this name. The lack of profit remains one concern. Last year’s $2.4 billion in net income was its best annual pull ever. In all honesty, that’s not that great. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) made $45 billion last year. Cut the market cap in half (so it’s closer to Amazon’s market cap) and we’re still looking at $22.5 billion in profit, some ten-fold what AMZN did. Valuation has never mattered with Amazon and it won’t start now. But it’s important to note.

Getty/Drew Angerer  You've probably heard the term "Amazoned" recently. It refers to Amazon's power to erase billions of dollars of competitor market cap by simply announcing that it's entering a new sector. It's an effect most clearly demonstrated by Amazon's recent acquisition of Whole Foods, which has sent shockwaves across competing grocery stores, brick-and-mortar retailers, and even pharmacies. To see how far this Amazon effect will go, analysts at Morgan Stanley surveyed their peers to see which sectors will be the most impacted by Amazon in the near- and long-term. Most analysts surveyed, more than 40 in total, said that food retail would be the sector hit the hardest. Amazon entering the food retail space through its Whole Foods purchase has already erased billions from grocer's market caps. In second place were department stores, with 49% of analysts saying that's the sector Amazon would disrupt the most in the next 12 months. This makes sense as consumer habits have been shifting towards ecommerce amid the retail apocalypse. In the non-consumer space, Wall Street sees logistics and transportation as the most vulnerable to Amazon, with 43% of analysts voting for this option. Retail real estate investment trusts came in second, with 36% of the vote. Amazon owns significantly less warehouse space than people think, with Walmart way out in front by that measure. The Whole Foods purchase adds about 1 million square feet of space to Amazon's warehouse holdings, but the company is looking to expand, which analysts think could upset the retail real estate industry.  Morgan Stanley's survey also asked analysts about which industries were mostly safe from Amazon's reach. They replied saying dollar stores would take the longest for Amazon to disrupt in the consumer space, while healthcare and commercial REITs would be the safest in the non-consumer space. As for the sector that has been the most unfairly impacted by Amazon? Well, that would be auto parts retailers, according to those surveyed. Shares of Amazon are up 27.55% this year.

Banks have had  nice moves higher over the past year, but nicer still were the moves in the TARP warrants. To review, as part of the TARP bailouts during the financial crisis, the government received warrants on lenders' common stock. The Treasury began selling these warrants in 2009, providing bank bulls with a leveraged way to play the recovery. "If the subprime credit-default swaps were this asymmetric, beautiful investment to express what was wrong with American capitalism…, these securities are the opposite,” says one hedge funder, whose firm bought about $200M of Bank of America's (NYSE:BAC) TARP warrants. BofA is higher by more than 50% since the 2016 election; the TARP warrants are up more than 200%. Similar moves are being seen in Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), and PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC), among others. An investment in the warrants of Zions Bancorp (NASDAQ:ZION) in 2013 is up 740% since vs. about a 150% rally in the common stock.

   A 40-year-old woman is now facing multiple felony charges after being busted by police in Scarsdale for drinking and driving with a blood alcohol content more than triple the legal limit on Monday morning.
   
   Officers in Scarsdale were on patrol shortly before 6:30 a.m. on Monday morning when they spotted a Honda Accord swerving across the double yellow line on Weaver Street, into the officers’ lane of traffic.
   
   During the subsequent traffic stop, officers said that the driver, Stamford, Conn. resident Dewanda Ross stated that she “had one beer several hours prior in Yonkers.” While speaking with Ross, officers said that they detected the smell of alcohol on her breath, and her eyes were glassy and bloodshot, while her speech was slow and slurred.
   
   Police said that when prompted to exit her vehicle, Ross “stated ‘my car is married,’ and several other statements that did not make sense.”
   
   After exiting her vehicle, police said that Ross proceeded to fail numerous Standardized Field Sobriety Tests and an alco-sensor FST showed she had a blood alcohol content of .21 percent. Later, a Datamaster DMT test taken at Scarsdale Police Headquarters showed she had a blood alcohol content of .25 percent. Ross was also in possession of marijuana at the time of her arrest.
   
   Ross was arrested and charged with felony counts of operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated with a prior conviction dating back to 2012 and aggravated driving while intoxicated with a blood alcohol content greater than .18 percent with a prior conviction. She was also charged with a misdemeanor count of using a borrowed vehicle without an interlock, unlawful possession of marijuana and several traffic violations.
   
   Following arraignment, Ross was released on $100 bail. She is due to appear in Scarsdale Village Court on Monday afternoon to answer the charge.

Shares of Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) are now higher by more than 25% year-to-date and looking strong. Helped by a spike in interest rates — as a result of a marginally more hawkish Federal Reserve and other G4 central banks — BAC stock has staged a technically sound breakout that could move higher. Like I always say in this here column, without the proper perspective on the markets any given trader or investor over time will likely stand to give back a large chunk of his or her gains. As such, the current shift in central bank posturing is crucial for investors and trades focusing on banking and other financial stocks. Over the past days, weeks and even months we have heard from a multitude of important central banks that they are slowly shifting to a more hawkish tone, if only moderately so. On the multi-year weekly chart, we see that BAC stock (top part of the chart) dropped sharply along with the rest of financial companies and indeed the broader market during the 2008/2009 financial crisis. After years of “basing,” BofA blasted higher following the U.S. election, and by so doing scored a technical breakout. Upside momentum however quickly again began to wane and the stock didn’t do much for bullish investors from early March until this past September. After a prolonged period of rest BAC stock in September finally took the next leg higher, which now looks to have further upside.

On this chart we see that the relative strength of financial stocks as a group has improved versus the broader large-cap market and indeed now looks giddy to break higher. In other words, BAC stock could be in for a period of not only absolute but also relative strength in the broader picture.

After the September breakout got overheated BAC stock in the second half of October started to rest again. While the stock remains in this near-term resting period, odds look favorable that ultimately a continuation-move higher sets in toward year-end. Active investors and traders could look to buy BAC around current levels in the mid to high $27s for a next upside target at $29, followed by possibly $30 — although I do not expect this move to take place in a straight line.

Bank of America Corporation (BAC) is an interesting player in the Financial space, with a focus on Money Center Banks. The stock has been active on the tape, currently trading at $27.39, down from yesterday’s close by -0.76%. Given the stock’s recent action, it seemed like a good time to take a closer look at the company’s recent data. Fundamental Analysis Money managers are always interested in a company that can find the right recipe of fundamental data because it reflects something important going on underneath the surface. Bank of America Corporation (BAC) currently trades with a market capitalization of $288.36 Billion. That value represents a market adjusting for revenues that have been growing by 16.23 % on a quarterly year/year basis as of the company’s last quarterly report. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For BAC, you can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $-13.11 Billion over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to fall in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $0.48 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 69.34% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors. Technical Analysis It’s important to check the technicals to get a sense of how BAC has been acting. Looking at the stock’s movement on the chart, Bank of America Corporation recorded a 52-week high of $27.98. It is now trading 0.59% off that level. The stock is trading $25.24 its 50-day moving average by -2.15%. The stock carved out a 52-week low down at $16.28. In recent action, Bank of America Corporation (BAC) has made a move of +5.92% over the past month, which has come on weak relative transaction volume. Over the trailing year, the stock is underperforming the S&P 500 by 22.64, and it’s gotten there by action that has been more volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. In terms of the mechanics underlying that movement, traders will want to note that the stock is trading on a float of 1.09% with $10.45 Billion sitting short, betting on future declines. That suggests something of the likelihood of a short squeeze in shares of BAC.

Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) fell by -0.76% in Wednesday’s trading session from $27.60 to $27.39 and has now fallen 3 consecutive sessions. The stock price went upward in 6 of the last 10 days and has generated 4.54% during the last two weeks. There was a decrease in both volume and price. This is usually interpreted as a good sign as traders widely believe falling stock should see declining volume. Traded activity experienced a fall of -1.08 million shares and in total 50.10 M shares exchanged hands for about $1 372.26 million. Inside BAC’s Recent Trend Bank of America Corporation (BAC) lies in the middle of a wide and strong rising trend in the short term and issued considerable signs about additional rally. Short-term traders are predicted to see a rally of 14.36% over the course of a quarter and, with 90% chance the price will be floating in the range of $28.53 and $32.43 in this timeframe. Bank of America Corporation Technical Signals 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 BAC has witnessed its short term MA triggering a sell signal. Meanwhile, however, the long-term average has generated a buy signal. When the short-run moving average rises above its longer-term trend, a buy signal is created. This is because a short-run moving average that crosses its long-run moving average counterpart is seen as the initiation of an upward trend. On additional rally, the share price will meet short term resistance at around $27.57. On a drop, the stock is likely to find some support over the long run, which begins at $25.93. A buy signal will be generated if it crosses above the short term moving average. Meanwhile, however, a price crossing below the long term moving average will generate a sell signal. Some other technical concerns emerged as well, putting in risk the future growth of the stock in the next couple of days. Its pivot point high generated sell signal on Friday October 27, 2017, which calls for additional declines until the stock forms a new pivot point low, as this could be a buying opportunity. The downbeat movement of both volume and price during the recent session is interpreted as a good sign because traders usually believe falling stock should see declining volume. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) Support And Resistance Levels In case of pullback, the next support the price will capture from accumulated volume will not be far away from current price at $25.83 and $25.45. In case of gains, the next resistance from accumulated volume will not be far away from today’s level at $27.63, $27.68 and $27.80. 
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 It is important to note, however, that the stock needs to make its way through natural risk while testing a key support level. Once this support is broken, another support level will be to be established at a lower level. Turning back to this stock, Bank of America Corporation approaches the first support point just current price at $25.83. In case of a break, the next support we will see from accumulated volume is going to be at $25.45 and $23.31. Accumulated volume is going to prevent the price from rising further at $27.63 and this action will lead the price to take a temporary pause or stay muted for a few days. Bank of America Corporation (BAC) Risk Assessment The number of shares changed hands in the stock is good, indicating the interest and low risk associated with it. In the most recent session, the stock price hovered around $0.38 (1.39%) between intraday high and intraday low. Each day in the past 1 week, the average volatility remained at 1.38%.

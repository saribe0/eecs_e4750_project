Security Singapore bank turns on AI to fight vice activities 

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-07/centuries-of-data-forewarn-of-rapid-reversal-from-low-interest-rates

Forget secular stagnation. One historian says the world is actually in its ninth “real rate depression” and 700 years of data show that – when it comes – the turnaround could be sudden. In research published on the Bank of England’s staff blog, Harvard University’s Paul Schmelzing says most work pointing to a period of permanently lower equilibrium real interest rates is too short term. Instead, he tracked the risk-free rate since 1311 by identifying the dominant asset of each period – starting with sovereign rates in the Italian city states in the 14th and 15th centuries and moving to long-term rates in Spain, then the Province of Holland, the U.K., Germany, and finally the U.S. Real rates, or the benchmark interest rates minus inflation, have averaged 4.78 percent while the 200-year real-rate average is 2.6 percent. That makes the current market environment “severely depressed,” Schmelzing wrote. However, it’s simply following a five-century downward trend, in which there have been nine periods of secular decline followed by reversals. For a QuickTake on free trade and its foes, click here The current period – since the 1980s – is the second-longest recorded and its closest historical analogy is the global “Long Depression” of the 1880s and 1890s which saw low productivity growth, deflationary price dynamics, and the rise of global populism and protectionism. This spell seems to have ended without a push from policy makers. That could be good news for those struggling to find a fix for the current low-rate environment. “There is strong evidence suggesting that the last ‘secular stagnation cycle’ started fading relatively autonomously after just over two decades following the key financial shock, not requiring the aid of decisive fiscal or monetary stimulus.” Be prepared though. The data show most reversals of real-rate stagnation periods have been rapid and non-linear. Within 24-months after hitting their troughs in the cycle, rates gained on average 315 basis points, with two occasions showing appreciations of more than 600 basis points, Schmelzing says. “Looking at past cyclical patterns, the evidence suggests that when rate cycles turn, real rates can relatively swiftly accelerate.”

 Element Data announced another acquisition today. The Seattle-area machine learning startup has purchased the technology assets and patents from Auguri Corporation, a small Silicon Valley company that describes itself as “a decision support software platform.” Auguri employed six people and will shut down as a result of the deal. Its chairman, Fadi Micaelian, will join Element Data as its new senior vice president of innovation and partnership, and will remain in California. Auguri’s customers included Boeing, the Department of Defense, and the United Nations. Ed Oates, co-founder of Oracle, was on Auguri’s board of advisors. “As we continue to grow through strategic acquisitions that complement our framework, Auguri Corporation provides us the ability to deploy into large scale enterprise level customers,” Element Data CEO Geoff McDonald said in a statement. The deal marks Element Data’s third acquisition this year. The 21-person company acquired the technology and team of PV Cube, a Seattle machine learning startup led by two vets of Microsoft Cortana and Bing, this past April. Last month, it bought the assets and patents of BehaviorMatrix, a Philadelphia startup that specializes in understanding the emotional responses audiences have to brands. Element Data’s flagship product is a Decision Insights Computing Engine (DICE), which uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to help people make decisions based on a broad range of criteria. In July, Element Data closed a $3.5 million funding round, led by returning investor Archibald Cox Jr., who also led the company’s $1.7 million seed round in April. Flying Fish, a new Seattle venture capital firm, also participated in the round. GeekWire is once again proud to partner with Bank of America to support Geeks Give Back, a community-wide effort to raise more than $1 million for the Washington State Opportunity Scholarship. This unique program provides scholarships to low- and middle-income Washington state residents pursuing their bachelor’s degree in science, technology, engineering and math.

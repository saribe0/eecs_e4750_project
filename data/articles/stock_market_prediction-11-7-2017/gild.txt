https://simplywall.st/news/2017/11/07/is-gilead-sciences-inc-gild-expensive-for-a-reason-a-look-at-the-intrinsic-value/

 I use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of varying growth rates for the company’s cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a more stable growth phase. To begin with we have to get estimates of the next five years of cash flows. For this I used the consensus of the analysts covering the stock, as you can see below. I then discount this to its value today and sum up the total to get the present value of these cash flows.  Present Value of 5-year Cash Flow (PVCF)= $35,413  We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after the five years. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at an annual growth rate equal to the 10-year government bond rate of 2.5%. We discount this to today’s value at a cost of equity of 14.7%.  Terminal Value (TV) = FCF2021 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = $9,993 × (1 + 2.5%) ÷ (14.7% – 2.5%) = $83,403 Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV) = TV / (1 + r)5 = $83,403 / ( 1 + 14.7%)5 = $41,924   The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the cash flows, which in this case is $77,337. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. If the stock is an depositary receipt (represents a specified number of shares in a foreign corporation) then we use the equivalent number. This results in an intrinsic value of $59.17, which, compared to the current share price of $73.46, we see that Gilead Sciences is fair value, maybe slightly overvalued and not available at a discount at this time.   The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don’t agree with my result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. Because we are looking at Gilead Sciences as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighed average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation I’ve used 14.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.631. This is derived from the Bottom-Up Beta method based on comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.   Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn’t be the only metric you look at when researching a company. What is the reason for the share price to differ from the intrinsic value? For GILD, I’ve put together three key factors you should further research:  1. Financial Health: Does GILD have a healthy balance sheet?

Latest evolution in the price of Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) stock has been one of the most talked about matter among the interested investors. At the end of the day, it’s only a stock’s performance that matters. With this in mind, it’s worth taking a look at the chart to get a sense of where it might be headed in the future. How has the stock performed recently? Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) in the last month has decreased -10.57%. Shares are now up over the past year, outperforming the broad market by -100% and underperformed a peer group of similar companies by -85%. After the latest session, which saw the stock close at a price of $73.46, GILD sits below its 52-week high. Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) has been trading in a bullish manner, based on the relative positions of the stock’s 20 and 200 day moving averages. Momentum indicators 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that GILD may be headed in the future. Fortunately, there is way to use the speed and magnitude of these price changes to predict future performance, thanks to what are known as momentum indicators. As momentum slows, it might be a sign that a support or resistance level has been reached, and that a trend is about to reverse. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for GILD is 31.18%, which suggests that the stock is not particularly expensive or cheap, and not predisposed to a reactive price movement based on this measure. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 11.96%, tells a different story, and suggests that GILD currently trades in oversold territory. What do the trading volumes reveal? Price isn’t the only tool analysts use to forecast future performance. Volume patterns can also reveal some important insights. If, for instance, a stock’s volumes suddenly increase by a significant amount, it’s usually a sign that the level of conviction behind the trade is high. Investors may feel very strongly about the future direction of the stock in question. Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD) average trading volume of 8,906,505 during the past month is 4.66% below its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been less active than usual in the stock in recent times. What do the analysts think? GILD is currently undervalued by -13.04% relative to the average 1-year price target of $84.48 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 2.40, which implies that analysts are generally neutral in their outlook for GILD over the next year. How risky is the stock?  When predicting the future performance for a stock, it’s also important to take into account risk. To do this, analysts often use a stock’s beta, which measures the stock’s volatility relative to the overall market. Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) has a beta of 1.17, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are more extreme than the market as a whole. GILD therefore has a above average level of market risk. During the past couple of weeks, GILD average daily volatility was 15.68%, which is 5.84 percentage points lower than the average volatility over the past 100 days.

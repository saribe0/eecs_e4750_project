Bargain hunters are wise to pay careful attention to insider buying, because although there are many various reasons for an insider to sell a stock, presumably the only reason they would use their hard-earned dollars to make a purchase, is that they expect to make money. Today we look at two noteworthy recent insider buys.      On Wednesday, Lockheed Martin ( LMT  )'s Director, Daniel F. Akerson, made a $780,059 buy of LMT, purchasing 2,500 shares at a cost of $312.02 each. Investors are able to buy LMT at a price even lower than Akerson did, with shares changing hands as low as $307.82 at last check today -- that's 1.3% under Akerson's purchase price. Lockheed Martin is trading up about 0.6% on the day Monday. This buy marks the first one filed by Akerson in the past twelve months.  makeArticleAd();    And at Mid-America Apartment Communities ( MAA  ), there was insider buying on Friday, by Director William Reid Sanders who bought 7,000 shares for a cost of $100.11 each, for a trade totaling $700,798. Mid-America Apartment Communities is trading up about 0.2% on the day Monday.

Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) and United Technologies Corporation (NYSE:UTX) are both Industrial Goods companies that recently hit new highs.

This is down from its earnings per share of $7.93 from the same time last year. It also wasn’t able to reach Wall Street’s earnings per share estimate of $3.26, which isn’t good news for LMT stock. Revenue of $12.17 billion for the third quarter of 2017 also didn’t do LMT stock any favors. Analysts were looking for Lockheed Martin Corporation to report revenue of $12.81 billion during the quarter. Still, it was an increase over its revenue of $11.55 billion from the third quarter of 2016.

The earnings cycle is sending some mixed signals for the first time this quarter as three more widely watched stocks provided just “OK” earnings results for the quarter. With the major indices trading at their all-time highs, “OK” results are usually likely to cause traders to start hitting the “sell” button, as we’re seeing on a few stocks today. Today’s three big stock charts analyze the price patterns of Biogen Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) and McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) as two out of three of these companies are trading lower in the wake of their earnings results creating potential buying opportunities.  Biogen shares traded strongly right into their earnings report, suggesting that the company needed to nail their earnings report to avoid a “sell the news” situation that would take BIIB stock back into its trading range. The report didn’t blow investor’s hair back, so let’s see what the chart says now:  Defense stocks have been among the groups of stocks posting strong, low volatility rallies, you know, the kind everyone likes. The problem happens when a company like that misses earnings, the way that Lockheed Martin did. This quarter’s results missed expectations, although management did guide forward earnings higher, which is the saving grace right now. So, is LMT stock a buy on this dip?

Lukas Vopnford of Midland is pushed out of bounds by Ross Ostendorf of Hastings during Saturday’s Great Plains Athletic Conference game at Heedum Field. The Warriors defeated the Broncos 32-24. Midland University snapped a four-game losing skid while the woes for Hastings College continued on Saturday afternoon at Heedum Field. Payton Nelson’s 22-yard touchdown pass to Alec Von Alvensleben on fourth down with 2:34 left in the game stretched Midland’s lead to eight points and the Warriors held on for a 32-24 win. The loss was the fourth straight for the Broncos, who fall to 5-5 overall, including 2-5 in the Great Plains Athletic Conference. The Warriors improve to 5-4 overall, including 3-4 in the league. “Today we found a way to win is the best way to put it,” Midland coach Jeff Jamrog said. “It was a great win for the program and a great effort by our guys. We needed it and I think we are headed in the right direction.” Nelson scrambled for the game’s final score before finding Von Alvensleben, who was left open after Hastings Semone Brown crumpled to the ground with an apparent knee injury. “If our corner doesn’t blow his knee out on that one, it is a fourth-down stop for us and we’re only down two points,” Hastings coach Tony Harper said. “But we have to be able to finish games out. We can’t throw interceptions and give up big plays on fourth down. All the credit goes to the Midland kids. They believed and they played hard the whole game.” The Broncos threatened on their last series, but were turned away by the Midland defense. The Warriors keep possession of the Watchorn-McLaughlin Trophy that goes to the game’s winner. The trophy is named after former MU head coach and athletic director Don Watchorn and former Hastings coach Tom McLaughlin. “We wanted to keep that trophy here and I think our kids were on a mission today,” Jamrog said. Nelson, a sophomore from Omaha North High School, led the Warriors to touchdowns on their first three possessions. Hayden Dunn was left wide open for the game’s first score — a 32-yard touchdown pass from Nelson. The conversion kick, however, failed leaving it 6-0 with 7:49 left in the opening period. Hastings answered with an eight-play, 69-yard march. Quarterback Clark Livingston capped the drive with a 5-yard touchdown run. Tom Schnase’s conversion put the Broncos up 7-6. Following the ensuing kickoff, it took the Warriors only two plays to respond. Malik Dumetz hauled in a 72-yard touchdown pass from Nelson. Midland went for two points, but it backfired when Ross Ostendorf intercepted the pass and ran it back for two points to cut MU’s lead to 12-9. Midland made it 19-9 when Nelson directed a six-play, 70-yard drive. The quarterback ran it in from 10 yards out. Matt Stankoski added the conversion kick. “We were lights out in the first half,” Jamrog said about the Warriors, who surpassed 300 yards in total offense combined in the first two periods. “We didn’t do as much in the second half, but we scored when we needed to.” Schnase capped an 11-play, 65-yard drive with a 27-yard field goal to trim the deficit to 19-12 with 10:30 left in the half and the Broncos drew closer a few minutes later. Punter Camdon Griffiths of the Warriors pinned Hastings back at the Hastings 1. Livingston threw an incompletion on the first play, but on second down Tahj Willingham broke free for a 99-yard touchdown run. The touchdown tied a GPAC and NAIA record for the longest rushing touchdown. It also set a new Hastings school record. Schnase failed on the conversion, leaving Midland up 19-18. The Warriors answered with an 87-yard drive that was capped by Garry Cannon’s 2-yard touchdown run. Cannon started the season at quarterback, but is now seeing action at running back. “Garry did some good things running the ball and Emmitt Knight gave us a burst in there,” Jamrog said about the University of South Dakota transfer. “We’ve been waiting for that day to happen for him like it did today.” Knight finished with 76 yards on just 10 carries while Cannon ran 13 times for 79 yards. MU led 26-18 at the break, but didn’t score again until Nelson connected with Von Alvensleben. Hastings’ lone score after the break came when Livingston found Rashaad Shamburger for a 5-yard TD pass. with 4:33 left in the third quarter. The try for two failed. “It was almost a tale of two halves,” Harper said. “In the first half, we didn’t play well at all defensively and Midland went up and down the field on us. Our offense had success against them. In the second half, our defense caused some turnovers and got stops, but our offense struggled at times.” Nelson was 11 of 20 passing for 246 yards and three touchdowns. He was intercepted once. Dumetz had three catches for 97 yards and Lukas Vonpford snagged two receptions for 54 yards. Linebacker Wyatt Tremayne had 11 stops to lead the defense. Tyler Blanco had six stops, intercepted one pass and broke up another. Bryan McLaughlin added six tackles and Exavier Edwards broke up three passes. Willingham led Hastings with 197 yards rushing on 24 carries. Livingston was 18 of 44 for 219 yards and one interception. The Warriors will honor their senior class on Saturday in the season finale. Midland will host Doane at 1 p.m. at Heedum.

http://www.columbiatribune.com/news/20171103/university-of-missouri-cuts-housing-meal-rates-for-2018

 The University of Missouri is cutting the cost of living and eating on campus as it tries to lure freshmen away from off-campus housing and convince more returning students to stay in dorms for a second year.The cost of the most popular residence and meal plans will be reduced by an average of 3.5 percent for the 2018-19 academic year, which begins in August, with new options for meals that can reduce the cost further, Chancellor Alexander Cartwright said Friday.The lowest-cost option for housing will be cut from $6,770 to $6,430 and the cheapest meal plan will be reduced from $2,840 for 175 meals to $2,550 for 150 meals. The reduction in the number of meals in the two most affordable plans is based on surveys to determine how many meals students are actually eating in the dining halls.Room rates will fall 5 percent in Hatch Hall and 2.2 percent in Gillett, Hudson, Wolpers and Gateway halls, Cartwright said.“I understand what it takes to do the hard work to be able pay for an education,” Cartwright said. “This is an opportunity for us to try to reduce those costs as much as we can.”As enrollment has fallen, the university has faced increasing competition from private student housing, with some offering signing bonuses of up to $1,000 and others offering to buy incoming freshmen out of residence hall contracts. The university has seven residence halls that have been closed or are seeing limited use because freshman enrollment is down more than 30 percent over two years.At an announcement on campus, Cartwright said the move is part of continuing efforts to make MU more affordable. The university has made more open-source textbooks available to students free of charge, cutting the total student spending on course materials by $1.8 million, he said. The Land Grant Compact, announced earlier this year, will cover tuition for Pell Grant-eligible students and 100 percent of unmet needs for Pell-eligible students in the honors college.University regulations require first-time freshmen to live in residence halls unless they receive a waiver. That loophole was exploited by the new student housing apartment complex on Ninth Street, The Rise, to seek tenants as it prepared to open for the fall semester.The university does not want to fill the halls by stricter enforcement of that rule, Vice Chancellor for Operations Gary Ward said. Instead, it wants to attract students to stay through their sophomore year — 275 have signed up already for next year, he said — and cutting the price is a way to do that. “Instead of trying to be heavy-handed, we want to earn it,” Ward said.MU owes $317 million toward construction bonds that financed residence halls. The annual payment of principal and interest is about $22.5 million per year. Reduced enrollment has not put the school's ability to make those payments in jeopardy but it has made it harder to maintain a balance for capital needs, Ward said. The rate cuts will be made up by an additional 50 students living in residence halls, said Alysha O'Neil, budget director for student affairs.Ward said he expects to do better than that."I am very confident we will be able to attract additional freshmen in to the residential life halls and we will be able to attract returning students," he said.One source of new residence hall tenants could be fraternity members. A report from Dyad Strategies on the Office of Greek Life at MU recommended ending the practice of allowing freshmen to live in chapter houses rather than residence halls.Whether that recommendation will be fully implemented is still an open question, Ward said."The idea is we are bringing Dyad back late this winter and spring, to work with our campus community to get a better idea of how we are going to implement their recommendations," he said.During the announcement, Cartwright touted the benefits of residence hall living. The price is all-inclusive, covering cleaning, laundry services, security and participation in freshman interest groups to support studies, he said.“It also includes support from live-in professional staff and access to academic success programs that apartments cannot offer,” Cartwright said.If the university is more successful in attracting and retaining students in the residence halls, the owners of private student housing will probably seek to market their apartments to young professionals or others who want to live downtown, said Jerry Dowell, government affairs director for the Columbia Chamber of Commerce.“Obviously Mizzou is going to do what they need to do and the off-campus housing owners are going to do what they need to do as well,” Dowell said.rkeller@columbiatribune.com573-815-1709 The University of Missouri is cutting the cost of living and eating on campus as it tries to lure freshmen away from off-campus housing and convince more returning students to stay in dorms for a second year.

Sholten Singer/The Herald-Dispatch Marshall wide receiver Tyre Brady turns a catch up field as the Herd takes on FIU in a C-USA football game on Saturday, Oct. 28, 2017, at Joan C. Edwards Stadium in Huntington, W.Va. HUNTINGTON - There is a nice balance building among the Marshall University wide receivers. On the outside, there is the playmaking ability of Tyre Brady - a long, athletic target with a nose for a big catch. And on the inside, there is Marcel Williams - a precise route-runner who uses his speed and quickness in cuts to break away from the defense. It is serving as the ultimate compliment for the Thundering Herd passing attack. In the last two weeks, both players have shown their explosiveness, combining to catch 30 passes for 397 yards and two touchdowns. It is part of a one-two punch that has led the Marshall air attack forward. "We threw the ball well offensively," Marshall head coach Doc Holliday said Friday night after Florida Atlantic beat the Herd, 30-25. "We just didn't take care of it." While the four interceptions thrown by quarterback Chase Litton are the glaring statistic in the contest, Williams and Brady both provide a positive note as Marshall (6-3, 3-2 Conference USA) moves forward and focuses on Western Kentucky (5-4, 3-2 C-USA) in a 6:30 p.m. Saturday game in Joan C. Edwards Stadium. Williams averaged 30 yards per catch in Friday's loss to Florida Atlantic, hauling in four passes to lead the Herd with 122 receiving yards. Three of Williams' four catches led to scores, and it was another strong outing after catching nine passes for 92 yards and a score in the loss to FIU the previous week. Williams said it is all about getting into a rhythm with Litton and with what a defense is showing. "It's something we've worked on from day one - just getting a feel for it," Williams said. "Later on in the year after you see certain coverages and get a feel for each other. You know you are getting the ball in certain coverages and you go and talk to the quarterback on and off the field. We've been through seven or eight games so you get a feel for it and work a route to get open." Litton said with the experience they've gained, Williams is a target that is one of the tops on his radar and a player that is breaking out for big gains consistently. "You get him the ball and he can do that," Litton said. "I have to do a better job of getting No. 9 the ball." Williams has really come on in the last few weeks, and Brady has maintained his consistency despite seeing a wealth of different coverages geared toward taking him away. Brady caught eight passes for 82 yards Friday against Florida Atlantic and hauled in nine receptions for 101 yards and a touchdown in the FIU loss. Currently, Brady is second in C-USA in two categories - receptions per game (6.1) and receiving yards per game (86.2). He also is tied for the C-USA lead in touchdown receptions with seven. With Williams' surge in production and Brady's consistency, Marshall has a two-man combination that is keeping the Herd offense moving through the air.

 The Missouri women’s basketball team is out of preseason tuneups.The real games begin on Friday, but if you ask coach Robin Pingeton she will tell you she wants two more weeks of practice.Sophie Cunningham and Jordan Frericks, after the team’s dominating 80-30 win over Division II McKendree, want the regular season games to begin.“I’m ready,” Frericks said with a laugh as the postgame presser ended.The Tigers looked ready Monday afternoon, as did Cunningham, who left Thursday’s scrimmage against Southwest Baptist in the first half with an injured hand.She started Monday and in 15 minutes scored 13 points on 5-of-7 shooting, grabbed seven rebounds and had two steals.The hand had no ill effects on the preseason All-SEC honoree.“It’s good. It’s feeling very healthy and I’m just icing it and stuff, so I’m all good,” said Cunningham, the Tigers leading scorer from a year ago.McKendree’s day offensively wasn’t as efficient as Cunningham’s and the Tigers defense had something to do with that. They flustered the Bearcats, forcing them to shoot just 25 percent, blocked seven shots and forced 22 turnovers. Missouri scored 34 points off of those turnovers.That was a welcome improvement from Thursday’s scrimmage, coach Robin Pingeton said.“We definitely needed to shore some things up from our first exhibition game, defensively, and I thought we did what we needed to do tonight on the defensive end, for the most part,” Pingeton said. “We did a good job of keeping them off the free throw line. I thought our presses were a little bit better than they were in the first exhibition game, so they made the adjustments that we talked about and did a good job with that.”Pingeton added that she would have liked to see the Tigers shoot better than they did. Missouri shot 46 percent from the field and 30 percent from behind the arc.Kayla Michael was the team’s second-leading scorer with 10 points and six rebounds.One player who had her hand in nearly every play was Jordan Frericks, who missed all of last season with a torn anterior cruciate ligament. Her first game back was Thursday and she built on that performance with nine points, seven rebounds, four steals, two blocks and two assists on Monday.Cunningham is glad to see Frericks back on the floor, but added that what the team missed the most was her leadership.“Everybody looks up to J,” Cunningham said. “She is such a strong body inside, she is a beast and everybody around the country knows it. It’s nice to have our little duo back together.”Missouri's two scrimmages are done. On Friday things get real when the Tigers travel to Iowa City to play Western Kentucky in the first game of the Hawkeye Challenge.Again, Frericks said the Tigers are ready.“I think these exhibition games were good for us to get our nerves out and see what we can continue to improve,” Frericks said. “I think throughout the whole year we will continue to improve, but I think we are ready for a good competition game.”  The Missouri women’s basketball team is out of preseason tuneups.

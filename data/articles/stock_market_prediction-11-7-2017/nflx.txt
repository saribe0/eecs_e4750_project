Nasdaq stocks continue to dominate the landscape. The latest round of earnings simply added gasoline to an already raging fire. But with the majority of the popular FANG stocks already skirting the stratosphere, it’s challenging to find low-risk entries. Unless you’re looking at Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), that is. Unlike its peers, NFLX stock yet remains close to its rising 20-day moving average. And while the rest of its pals have already busted through well-established resistance zones, NFLX hasn’t. But it’s getting darn close, and that’s what attracted me to it for today’s pick. Year-to-date, Netflix is already up 63% in what can only be described as a banner year for shareholders. At $201.50, it sits a mere pebble toss from record highs. The consolidation striking the stock over the past month has allowed the 20-day moving average to catch up, making it one of the least extended stocks of the coveted FANG gang. And that makes it a much easier stock to buy. Netflix shares have a long history of rewarding breakout buyers. More times than not, breaching resistance delivers swift follow through and big profits to buyers. Here’s to hoping such an outcome awaits for the upcoming breakout over $203. With earnings fading in the distance, implied volatility has receded to the lower end of its one-year range. And that means option premiums are cheap once more. To capitalize on the next breakout, consider buying the Jan $200/$215 bull call spread for $6.30. The max loss is limited to the initial debit and will be forfeited if NFLX sits below $200 at expiration. The max gain of $8.70 will be captured if Netflix shares can rise above $215 by expiration. By risking $6.30 to win $8.70, the option spread offers a potential return on investment of 138%. As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn’t hold positions in any of the aforementioned securities.

 Shares of 21 st  Century Fox FOXA  suddenly popped over 6% in Monday afternoon trading, shortly after reports suggesting that the company was looking to sell most of its assets to Disney DIS  emerged. According to people familiar with the matter cited by CNBC  , Fox has been holding talks with Disney over the past few weeks, but there is no certainty that the discussions will lead to a deal. In fact, these sources said that the chatter has been on again, off again, and the two sides are not currently engaged in deal talks. Per CNBC's initial report, Fox's willingness to engage in sales talks stems from a growing sense among senior management that the company would not be able to reach the scale believed to be needed for success in today's media world through acquisitions. Nevertheless, it does not appear that Disney would purchase all of Fox. Instead, Fox believes that a "more tightly focused group of properties around news and sports could compete more effectively in the current marketplace," said CNBC. Movie and television production companies like 21 st  Century Fox have been challenged by the likes of Netflix NFLX  , Amazon AMZN  , Alphabet GOOGL  , and Facebook FB  in recent years, with each of these tech behemoths working to change the nature of content consumption in their own individual ways. This evolution has also affected Disney, which has struggled with subscriber losses in key entities like ESPN. In response, the massive media conglomerate is preparing to launch its own direct-to-consumer streaming service, and adding another studio such as Fox could potentially bolster that platform's appeal. Shares of FOXA surged more than 6.5% to touch an intraday high of $26.60 in the wake of CNBC's initial report. Disney shares were up about 1.3% at the time of this writing.

 NVIDIA CorporationNVDA is scheduled to report third-quarter 2018 results on Nov 9. We expect the company to benefit from growing strength in the artificial intelligence (AI) space. Moreover, the company's innovative product pipeline along withstrength in gaming and high-end notebook GPUs keep it well positioned. NVIDIA's efforts toward autonomous vehicle alsoexhibitits intention to be the largest player in the self-driving and machine learning arena too. We also believe that the higher adoption of NVIDIA's Tegra processors will act as a catalyst, going ahead. Let's dwell deeper and find out the factors influencing the results. AI Space:  Key Catalyst NVIDIA is one of the leading players in AI for applications to autonomous driving and also sells its GPUs to Alphabet, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon for their data centers. The graphics chipmaker possesses both a powerful all-purpose AI-enabled processor and its CUDA software programming platform, which helps build out AI software. Compared withcompetitive products like Alphabet's GOOGL Google AI chip, analysts believe that NVIDIA's processor has a larger potential customer base. "Incumbency matters and Nvidia has a much wider AI/machine learning ecosystem that will be tough to match," Arya said. Notably, the company entered into a wide range of partnerships based on its AI technology, namelyBaidu, Foxconn, Inventec, Quanta, Wistron, Volkswagen, Volvo and Autoliv. Demand for NVIDIA's DGX AI supercomputer also remained high as more organizations are keen on building AI-enabled applications. It has shipped the system to over 300 customers, so far, and more than 1,000 are in the pipeline. Per NVIDIA, Facebook is using its 128 DGX system. With these deal, NVIDIA will be better poise to reinforceits hold in the AI technologies. It is also worth mentioning that, NVIDIA recently unveiled a new AI supercomputer chip designed for self-driving cars called Pegasus at its GPU Technology Conference (GTC) in Europe. This new technology, Pegasus helps to drive fully autonomous robotaxis which can handle the concept of Level 5 self-driving vehicles and uses NVIDIA's DRIVE PX 2 platform, trained on deep neural networks. The recent launch is seen as NVIDIA's determined focus on remaining ahead of its rivals - Intel Corporation INTC and Qualcomm Inc. QCOM - in the driverless car technology space. NVIDIA continues to be the world's biggest graphic processing hardware provider for PCs since the past several decades. Recently, the company joined forces with Square Enix to unveil Final Fantasy XV Windows Edition for PC in Gamescom 2017. The collaboration is aimed at bringing an enhanced gaming experience to PCs. This deal is a positive for NVIDIA, as it will help the company gain market share among gaming content developers. We expect the momentum to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well, consequently bolstering the top-line performance. Segments Continue to Outstand Continuing its earnings streak for the ninth straight quarter, NVIDIA had reported splendid second-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein it not only marked a strong year-over-year improvement, but also way came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Segment-wise, revenues from the GPU business jumped 59% year over year to $1.9 billion, driven by strength in GeForce GPUs Gaming revenues and datacenter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GPUs is pegged at $1.962 billion, up 15.6% year over year. Revenues from Gaming GPU were up 52% on a year-over-year basis to $1.19 billion in the last reported quarter. Per the company, strong growth "reflects the vibrant gaming ecosystem, underpinned by continued excitement over our recent launch GPUs and other technologies, great games, and growing interest in e-sports." The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Gaming is pegged at $1.332 billion. Additionally, revenues from datacenter came in at $416 million, registering a year-over-year increase of over 2.5 times, mainly fueled by strong adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning, high-performance computing (HPC), and GRID technologies. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for datacenter is pegged at $460 million. Tegra processor revenues came in at $333 million, which doubled on a year-over-year basis. The increase was primarily due to better-than-expected growth in Tegra development services. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Tegra processor is pegged at $375 million, up 55.6% year over year. Automotive revenues for the quarter came in at $142 million, reflecting an increase of 19% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Automotive is pegged at $150 million. Moving to Professional Visualization, revenues from Quadro increased 10% year over year and came in at $235 million. The increase was mainly owingto elevated demand in real-time rendering tools and mobile workstations. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Professional Visualization is pegged at $237 million.

Source: Shutterstock Calling a spade a spade, there are plenty of reasons NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) could, and arguably should, worry investors. Aside from the fact that NVDA stock is priced at a frothy 51.9 times its forward-looking earnings, rivals Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) have finally figured out they’re going to have to team up to slow Nvidia’s growing dominance in artificial intelligence (AI) as well as within the cryptocurrency mining arena. Yet, of all the reasons to sell your NVDA stock, recent comments from Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk (suggesting his company’s self-driving vehicle platform might need more computing power than Nvidia’s technology is currently giving it) isn’t one of them. The short version of a long story: Unbeknownst — until last week anyway — to many investors is that Nvidia has partnered with Tesla to provide some of the hardware and technologies that power its so-called Enhanced Autopilot system. It’s not been a secret, to be fair. In that Tesla has only been selling on the order of 25,000 vehicles per quarter so far this year, though, it’s just not been terribly interesting. Nvidia’s ‘story’ has mostly been about everything else it’s doing — GPUs, AI, data center and more. Self-driving cars are the future, but they’re not a significant part of the present, even though the premise is uber-cool. When asked about the prospect of launching a fully autonomous vehicle, during the Q&A portion of Tesla’s most recent earnings call, however, Musk loosely alluded to the possibility that the current self-driving technology may not be powerful enough. He commented: “The question is not just full autonomy, but full autonomy with what level of reliability? And what will be acceptable to regulators? For customers that have signed up for self-driving capability, or purchased that option, if it does turn out that a computer upgrade is necessary in order to meet the regulatory requirement in their area, we will replace their computer with something with greater power.” NVDA stock investors: Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain… The computer in question is largely built around Nvidia hardware, prompting a slight setback for NVDA stock shortly thereafter, with the stage for that weakness set by September’s rumors that Tesla and AMD were possibly teaming up in the development of a custom-built AI chip that could provide the computing power necessary to drive autonomous cars. Though the rumor was (mostly) debunked a few days later, the seeds of doubt had been planted. Sometimes, a little doubt is all it takes. Still… Were it any other company or any other CEO, such comments — coupled with credible-sounding rumors — might be treated as plausible developments. This is Elon Musk, though, who more so than most any other chief executive tends to verbalize his stream of consciousness without sharing the full context of those thoughts. He has a way of skipping that they’re just part of a list of possibilities.

https://stocknewsgazette.com/2017/11/06/a-side-by-side-analysis-of-nvidia-corporation-nvda-and-cirrus-logic-inc-crus/

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares are up more than 95.51% this year and recently increased 1.34% or $2.75 to settle at $208.69. Cirrus Logic, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRUS), on the other hand, is down -0.21% year to date as of 11/03/2017. It currently trades at $56.42 and has returned -1.05% during the past week. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Cirrus Logic, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRUS) are the two most active stocks in the Semiconductor – Specialized industry based on today’s trading volumes. We will compare the two companies based on the strength of various metrics, including growth, profitability, risk, return, and valuation to determine if one is a better investment than the other. Growth One of the key things investors look for in a company is the ability to grow earnings at a high compound rate over time. Analysts expect NVDA to grow earnings at a 12.92% annual rate over the next 5 years. Comparatively, CRUS is expected to grow at a 20.00% annual rate. All else equal, CRUS’s higher growth rate would imply a greater potential for capital appreciation. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Profitability and Returns Just, if not more, important than the growth rate is the quality of that growth. Growth can actual be harmful to investors if it comes at the cost of weak profitability and low returns. To adjust for differences in capital structure we’ll use EBITDA margin and Return on Investment (ROI) as measures of profitability and return., compared to an EBITDA margin of 23.86% for Cirrus Logic, Inc. (CRUS). NVDA’s ROI is 19.80% while CRUS has a ROI of 21.70%. The interpretation is that CRUS’s business generates a higher return on investment than NVDA’s. Cash Flow  
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 If there’s one thing investors care more about than earnings, it’s cash flow. NVDA’s free cash flow (“FCF”) per share for the trailing twelve months was +0.90. Comparatively, CRUS’s free cash flow per share was +1.05. On a percent-of-sales basis, NVDA’s free cash flow was 7.81% while CRUS converted 4.34% of its revenues into cash flow. This means that, for a given level of sales, NVDA is able to generate more free cash flow for investors. Liquidity and Financial Risk Liquidity and leverage ratios are important because they reveal the financial health of a company. NVDA has a current ratio of 7.80 compared to 4.00 for CRUS. This means that NVDA can more easily cover its most immediate liabilities over the next twelve months. NVDA’s debt-to-equity ratio is 0.35 versus a D/E of 0.00 for CRUS. NVDA is therefore the more solvent of the two companies, and has lower financial risk. Valuation NVDA trades at a forward P/E of 51.99, a P/B of 20.85, and a P/S of 14.81, compared to a forward P/E of 11.69, a P/B of 3.12, and a P/S of 2.26 for CRUS. NVDA is the expensive of the two stocks on an earnings, book value and sales basis. Given that earnings are what matter most to investors, analysts tend to place a greater weight on the P/E. Analyst Price Targets and Opinions When investing it’s crucial to distinguish between price and value. As Warren Buffet said, “price is what you pay, value is what you get”. NVDA is currently priced at a 21.27% to its one-year price target of 172.08. Comparatively, CRUS is -18.13% relative to its price target of 68.91. This suggests that CRUS is the better investment over the next year. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 2.40 for NVDA and 2.30 for CRUS, which implies that analysts are more bullish on the outlook for NVDA. Risk and Volatility To gauge the market risk of a particular stock, investors use beta. Stocks with a beta above 1 are more volatile than the market as a whole. Conversely, a beta below 1 implies below average systematic risk. NVDA has a beta of 1.20 and CRUS’s beta is 0.02. CRUS’s shares are therefore the less volatile of the two stocks. Insider Activity and Investor Sentiment Analysts often look at short interest, or the percentage of a company’s float currently being shorted by investors, to aid in their outlook for a particular stock. NVDA has a short ratio of 0.94 compared to a short interest of 5.31 for CRUS. This implies that the market is currently less bearish on the outlook for NVDA. Summary Cirrus Logic, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRUS) beats NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) on a total of 10 of the 14 factors compared between the two stocks. CRUS is more profitable, generates a higher return on investment, has higher cash flow per share and has lower financial risk. In terms of valuation, CRUS is the cheaper of the two stocks on an earnings, book value and sales basis, CRUS is more undervalued relative to its price target. Finally, FSLR has better sentiment signals based on short interest.

Latest evolution in the price of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has been one of the most talked about matter among the interested investors. It is widely believed that a stock’s future performance can best be predicted by analyzing prior trends and patterns in price. In the case of NVDA, the chart has some interesting things to say about where the stock might be headed in the future. How has the stock performed recently? NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the last month has increased +15.11%. Shares are now up over the past year, outperforming the broad market by -100% and outperformed a peer group of similar companies by 342%. After the latest session, which saw the stock close at a price of $208.69, NVDA sits below its 52-week high. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been trading in a bullish manner, based on the relative positions of the stock’s 20 and 200 day moving averages. Momentum indicators 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that NVDA may be headed in the future. In order to predict this, technical analysts look at momentum indicators, which measure the speed and magnitude of these price movements. The idea is that as momentum slows, it may signal the approach of key support or resistance levels and a reversal of recent trends. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for NVDA is 72.05%, which suggests that the stock may be primed for a trend reversal or a corrective pullback in price. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 91.15%, tells a similar story, and suggests that NVDA currently trades in overbought territory. What do the trading volumes reveal? Volume patterns are useful for gauging the level of conviction behind price changes, and can be used to make predictions about future price movements. A sudden increase in a stock’s activity can be a sign that investors are trading in anticipation of a catalyst, or that investors feel very strongly in one way or the other about the future direction of a stock. NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) average trading volume of 13,179,010 during the past month is 25.29% below its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been less active than usual in the stock in recent times. What do the analysts think? NVDA is currently overvalued by 21.27% relative to the average 1-year price target of $172.08 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 2.40, which implies that analysts are generally neutral in their outlook for NVDA over the next year. How risky is the stock?  Absolute price performance isn’t the only thing analysts consider when predicting future performance: volatility matters as well. Beta, which measures the stock’s volatility relative to the overall market, is a simple but effective metric for assessing risk. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has a beta of 1.20, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are more extreme than the market as a whole. NVDA therefore has a above average level of market risk. During the past couple of weeks, NVDA average daily volatility was 19.68%, which is 13.82 percentage points lower than the average volatility over the past 100 days.

https://investorplace.com/2017/11/exercise-caution-nvidia-nvda-stock-ahead-earnings/

Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has been on a huge rally recently. NVDA stock is up more than 15% over the past month and has solidly overtaken the $200 level. It seems like this is a growth stock that just can’t be stopped. But it pays to remember that every once and a while, earnings are a road bump in this growth story. Just look at the most recent earnings report. Despite big beats, NVDA stock dropped more than 5%. The same thing happened in February 2017, when a big earnings beat resulted in NVDA stock dropping. What do those two earnings reports have in common? NVDA stock had rallied big into both of those prints. But when NVDA doesn’t rally big into earnings, NVDA stock tends to jump big on solid numbers. See the May 2017 and November 2016 reports. Overall then, NVDA earnings are a “sell the news” event when the stock has rallied big into the report. They are a “buy the surprise” event when the stock has been flattish into the report. Where does NVDA find itself today? Well, the stock has rallied 33% since the last earnings report. That puts NVDA stock in the ballpark of where it was prior to the August 2017 and February 2017 reports. Prior to the August 2017 report, NVDA stock had run up 35% since the last earnings report. Prior to the February 2017 report, NVDA stock had run up 32% since the prior earnings report. After both the August and February 2017 reports, NVDA stock dropped. Consequently, it looks like NVDA earnings are a “sell the news” event this time around. I expect shares to drop in response to the quarterly numbers. My conviction in this is strengthened by looking at how Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stock dropped after its strong quarterly report.

Short-term traders are predicted to see a rally of 23.7% over the course of a quarter and, with 90% chance the price will be floating in the range of $231.27 and $259.87 in this timeframe. NVIDIA Corporation Technical Signals 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

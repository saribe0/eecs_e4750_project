Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) on Nov. 3, 2017 saw a modest increase, closing the day at $299.26, or a increase of $6.83 or (2.28%).Volume levels spiked and TSLA actually managed a breakout which translated to 8.88 million shares changing hands on the day.

Driving interest in Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) is a number of factors, including perhaps, a steady decrease of the profile of the company as insider activity takes center stage. This activity has been headed largely by Eric Branderiz, an officer of the company. Eric Branderiz has seen steady activity on the sell side, and on October 24, 2017, executed an option to sell 1736 shares. The disposition, at a price of $339.49, resulted in Eric Branderiz bringing total 0 shares. Other officers which have joined Eric Branderiz in selling shares include Kimbal Musk who sold for 2190 shares. The option since executed brings Musk ownership to 154904 shares. Jon Mcneill, an officer at (TSLA), sold 553 shares at a price of 349.65 to bring his total ownership in the stock to 2,239 shares. But it’s not just selling activity that is creating investor interest in TSLA; over the last several weeks, several insiders have bought shares. On October 24, 2017, Eric Branderiz executed a direct buy involving 1736 shares. Also included in the list of buyers for the last 3 months Jon Mcneill who executed a direct buy for 1,053 shares on September 5, 2017.Officer John Douglas Field bought 4874 shares on September 5, 2017, bringing his total number of shares held to 24182.

US stocks cruised to fresh records for the second straight day on Monday amid a tech-sector mega-merger, while European stocks ended mixed. Before trading began in New York, Broadcom launched a $130.0B unsolicited bid for rival chip manufacturer Qualcomm in a cash and stock offer that was 28% above Qualcomm’s closing price on Friday. That pushed the tech-rich Nasdaq up 0.3%, while shares in Broadcom and Qualcomm jumped more than 1%. Crude prices hit a two-year high amid sweeping crackdown in oil-rich Saudi Arabia, which included the arrest of billionaire investor Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal. A barrel of benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude for December delivery soared $1.71 to finish at $57.35.
Oil shares also felt the impact, with Royal Dutch Shell and BP soaring more than two percent, and Chevron, ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil all rising sharply. “The big story today is energy and the IT sector,” Karl Haeling of LBBW told AFP, noting that the S&P energy index rose more than 2%. “That’s probably helping optimism over mergers and acquisitions.” Meanwhile, in London the FTSE 100 edged higher to reach a new record close. However, in the eurozone both Frankfurt and Paris dipped despite the euro sliding against the dollar. Market analyst David Madden at CMC Markets UK put it down to a lack of news. (Source: Fin24) “Volatility has been low and we have seen some small amounts of profit taking,” he said. “Stock markets have been strong in Europe lately and it appears the bulls are taking a breather today.” Top Pick for Tuesday: Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) has grabbed attention from the analysts when it experienced a change of -1.08% in the last trading session to close at $302.78. Tesla Inc. has attained Perbix, a closely held maker of automated machines used for manufacturing, as the electric-car maker struggles to boost production of its most important new model. Perbix has been a supplier to the automaker led by Elon Musk for almost three years, according to a Tesla spokesman, who declined to disclose the terms of the deal. Tesla will expand its presence in the Minneapolis area where Perbix is based, the spokesman said. Musk last week alluded to automation challenges as among the reasons the Model 3 sedan, which starts at $35,000, has gotten off to a bumpy start. The chief executive officer pushed back a projection for when Tesla will make 5,000 of the cars per week by about three months, to the end of the first quarter of next year. Tesla said in a filing last week it’ll wait until reaching that intermediate target before taking steps to boost weekly output to 10,000 units, allowing the company time to optimize its automation and conserve spending. (Source: Bloomberg) A total of 6,476,745 shares exchanged hands during the intra-day trade contrast with its average trading volume of 5.75M shares, while its relative volume stands at 1.13. Relative volume is the comparison of current volume to average volume for the same time of day, and it’s displayed as a ratio. If RVOL is less than 1 it is not In Play on this trading day and Investors may decide not to trade it.  If RVOL is above 2 it is In Play and this is more evidence Investors ought to be in the name.  When stocks are *very* In Play one can see a RVOL of 5 and above.  The higher the RVOL the more In Play the stock is. Day traders strive to make money by exploiting minute price movements in individual assets (usually stocks, though currencies, futures, and options are traded as well), usually leveraging large amounts of capital to do so, therefore they trade on Stocks in Play. In Play Stocks are volatile enough to produce good risk and reward trading opportunities for both bull and bear traders intraday. Most company stocks have very little volatility. They generally move extremely slowly and they only produce big price swings when the company produces good or bad trading results, which may only happen a couple of times a year at best. In deciding what to focus on – in a stock, say – a typical day trader looks for three things: liquidity, volatility and trading volume. Liquidity allows an investor to enter and exit a stock at a good price (i.e. tight spreads, or the difference between the bid and ask price of a stock, and low slippage, or the difference between the predictable price of a trade and the actual price). If a stock does not have good liquidity then it may take some time before a broker is able to negotiate a deal to buy or sell a stock and the broker may not be able to get the sell or buy price that the trader is looking for. This is a problem for day traders and it could mean the difference between a profitable and non-profitable trade. Traders have different rules for what constitutes liquidity and a good guide is the volume of trades and volume of shares that are traded each day. 100,000 shares traded per day would be a minimum for most traders and some require 1,000,000. Trading volume is a gauge of how many times a stock is bought and sold in a given time period (most commonly, within a day of trading, known as the average daily trading volume – ADTV). A high degree of volume indicates a lot of interest in a stock. Often, a boost in the volume of a stock is a harbinger of a price jump, either up or down. Volatility is simply a measure of the predictable daily price range—the range in which a day trader operates. More volatility means greater profit or loss. After a recent check, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) stock is found to be 3.93% volatile for the week, while 2.83% volatility is recorded for the month. Technical’s Snapshot: The stock has a market cap of $49.40B and the number of outstanding shares has been calculated 163.16M. Based on a recent bid, its distance from 20 days simple moving average is -10.32%, and its distance from 50 days simple moving average is -13.08% while it has a distance of -5.13% from the 200 days simple moving average. The company’s distance from 52-week high price is -22.29% and the current price is 69.92% away from 52-week low price. The company has Relative Strength Index (RSI 14) of 33.08 together with Average True Range (ATR 14) of 10.77. Stock’s Valuation: Past 5 years growth of TSLA observed at -13.10%, and for the next five years the analysts that follow this company is expecting its growth at 35.00%. The stock’s price to sales ratio for trailing twelve months is 4.59 and price to book ratio for the most recent quarter is 9.80, whereas price to cash per share for the most recent quarter are 16.27. Its quick ratio for the most recent quarter is 0.60. Analysts mean recommendation for the stock is 2.80. This number is based on a 1 to 5 scale where 1 indicates a Strong Buy recommendation while 5 represents a Strong Sell.

Tesla’s earnings numbers were not welcome news for investors. Today, the company said it delivered 26,137 cars during the third quarter, but only 222 of those were Model 3s. That’s far below the 1,500 Tesla was hoping to have delivered by this time. Overall, the company posted a loss of $619 million on sales of $2.98 billion. Tesla shares dropped by as much as 5.4% on the news in after-hours trading, before recovering slightly. Overall, the company’s stock is up by about 50% for the year. Tesla CEO Elon Musk had warned there would be bumps in the road as Tesla entered “production hell” for the Model 3, and in August warned of “production bottlenecks.” In a Nov. 1 letter to investors (pdf), Tesla clarified that the primary production constraint is the battery module assembly line in its Gigafactory 1 outside Reno, Nevada. Tesla said it was redesigning two parts of the battery assembly process, “key elements of which were done by manufacturing systems suppliers,” to streamline its automated manufacturing process. Musk says he’s camping out at the factory until the problems are resolved. In describing the struggle to get manufacturing back on track, he made an allusion to the nine circles of hell in Dante Alighieri’s Inferno. “We were in level nine, and we’re now in level eight and close to exiting level eight,” said Musk, “I thought we’d be more like level seven. I was really depressed three or four weeks ago.” Musk said that Tesla’s reliance on a small number of robotic stations to automate construction of the vehicle, rather than human workers, means that any problems on the line can slow assembly dramatically. The company’s fortunes are riding on the Model 3, which has a base price of $35,00. Tesla is betting its first mass-market car will elevate it to become the first automaker to join America’s famous “Big 3” in more than 50 years. Tesla has already surpassed all of them in market value at one time (GM put Tesla back in second place earlier this year), but the electric carmaker has yet to prove its staying power.  So far, it’s been a rough ride. Musk must coordinate a sprawling supply and production chain, including two factories where cars are assembled in Fremont and the Gigafactory where Model 3 battery packs and drive units are made. Tesla notes that its manufacturing process is more automated than most carmakers, and therefore takes longer to establish. The company said it plans to make 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week by about March 2018 (a quarter later than initially predicted) and then 10,000 units per week sometime after that. The company has about $3.5 billion in cash entering the fourth quarter to make it happen.

 @FredericLambert After market close today, Tesla released its financial results and shareholders letter for the third quarter 2017. Wall Street was expecting record revenue of about $2.9 billion for the quarter and a loss of about $2.45 per share due to large capital expenditure caused by the slow start of Model 3 production. The company released the official results today delivering on revenue of ~$2.9 billion and missed on earnings with a loss of $3.70 per share (GAAP).

(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Here we will be posting our follow-up posts about the earnings to expand on the most important points (refresh the page to see the most recent posts): The shareholder letter has been embedded in full below. Tesla’s stock price was down 4% in aftermarket trading following the release of the results. The results compare to revenue of ~$2.8 billion and a loss of $2.04 per share (GAAP) during the previous quarter. Tesla slightly updated its record delivery results for Model S and Model X: “In Q3, we delivered 25,915 Model S and Model X vehicles and 222 Model 3 vehicles, for a total of 26,137 deliveries. Combined Model S and Model X deliveries in Q3 grew 18% globally compared to Q2 and 4.5% versus the same quarter one year ago. Consequently, both Model S and Model X gained further market share in the US luxury vehicle market. In addition, our used vehicle sales more than doubled from the prior quarter.” The company’s gross margin took a big hit: 18.3% down from 27.9% quarter-over-quarter. It is attributed to Model 3 production being extremely costly right now with little deliveries. Investors will be happy to know that Tesla is not planning another capital raise despite its wider losses: “Between cash on hand, future cash flows and available lines of credit, we believe that we are well capitalized to accommodate the revised ramp of Model 3 production to 5,000 per week. Upon achieving this production level, we expect to generate significant cash flows from operating activities.” Here’s the shareholder letter in full:

Tesla earnings (Shutterstock photo) Tesla (TSLA), which has ambitions of being more mainstream, will report third quarter fiscal 2017 earnings results after Wednesday's closing bell. But investors would feel much better if the luxury electric vehicle company had ambitions of being more profitable. Tesla shares have taken a massive beating over the past couple of weeks, falling as much as 18% from its all-time high of $386.99 reached in June to a recent low of $316.66 — the stock’s lowest level since early August. A combination of factors has impacted TSLA stock. But the biggest concern rests with Tesla’s money-making capabilities, particularly as it relates its highly-anticipated Model 3 sedan — the company’s first attempt at producing a mass market electric vehicle. Tesla reportedly spends some $80,000 to build each Model 3, which will retail for $35,000 — or about half the price of Tesla's next-cheapest car, the Model S. The company believes the lower price point would enable it to emerge from a niche market to better compete with Detroit heavyweights General Motors (GM) and Ford (F). On Wednesday the Street will want to get a sense of not only how realistic Tesla’s Model 3 delivery goals are, but also how much cash it will take to meet those goals. Earlier this month the company spooked investors when announcing that its third-quarter Model 3 delivery totals would be 220 vehicles. Though that marked a 4.5% increase year over year, it’s below the 1,260 vehicles analysts expected and well below the company’s year-end production targets of 20,000 Model 3s a month by December. On Friday analysts at Evercore downgraded TSLA stock from Buy to Neutral, advising their clients to be “more cautious” on Model 3 production. The Model 3 is “the most important piece of the Tesla investment story in coming quarters,” Evercore warned. In terms of overcoming production hiccups, which CEO Elon Musk recently described at “manufacturing hell,” Evercore noted, “We suspect that Tesla won’t have 100% visibility on the ramp until they hit more than 1,000 Model 3 units per week.” As such, the firm reduced its price target on TSLA stock to $312, from $330, implying a 3% downside to Friday’s closing price of $320.87. In the three months that ended September, Wall Street expects the Palo Alto, Calif.-based company to post a per-share loss of $2.29 on revenue of $2.94 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when the company lost 71 cents per share on $2.3 billion in revenue. For the full year, ending in December, the loss is expected to be $6.67 per share, compared to a loss of $2.87 a year ago, while full-year revenue of $11.84 billion would rise 69.2% year over year. All told, with the 1,000 Model 3 units per week benchmark expected to be reached toward the end of November, Tesla has a lot to prove Wednesday if it wants to keep its shares from driving in reverse. From my vantage point, however, these shares, which I now own, are not as risky as they were three months ago. I’ve said this before, Tesla’s main problem — if you can call it that — is that the company must overcome too much demand for its products. And that’s a business I want a piece of.

Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) gained 2.28% in Friday’s session, going up from its prior closing price of $299.26 to $306.09. The price has fallen in 6 of the last 10 days and is down by -11.3% over the same course of time. Trading activity decreased by -10.93 million shares, and in total, 8.84 M shares exchanged hands for about $2 704.35 million. It should be noted that increasing price and decreasing volume show lack of interest and this is a warning that something has fundamentally changed. Inside TSLA’s Recent Trend Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) lies in the lower of a wide and falling trend in the short term, and this will normally pose a very good buying opportunity. A break down through the resistance trend line at $298.82 will initially point to a quick declining speed. Short-term traders are anticipated to see a retreat of -7.13% over the course of a quarter and, with 90% chance the price will be floating in the range of $277.51 and $343.54 in this timeframe. Tesla, Inc. Technical Signals 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 TSLA has witnessed its long term and short term MA triggering a sell signal. Many traders watch for long-term averages to cross above short-term averages to signal the beginning of a downtrend. Upon corrections, the price will meet resistance from the averages between $317.87 and $344.94. A buy signal will be generated if it crosses above any of these levels. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) Support And Resistance Levels Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) recorded volume accumulation so there will probably be a surplus of buyers at $299.26. In case of gains, the next resistance from accumulated volume will be at $348.14, $355.40 and $356.91.

 Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) Risk Assessment A volatility based measure Bollinger Bands suggests this stock poses high risk. In the most recent session, the stock price hovered around $11.12 between high and low, or 3.77%. The average volatility for the past week stood at 3.77%. Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) is in oversold territory based on Relative Strength Index reading (28). In some cases it takes more time for the trend to shift while the stock is being oversold and the Relative Strength Index keeps moving.

U.S. stock futures are mixed this morning, as Wall Street struggles for new highs heading into what could be a volatile week. House Republicans unveiled their tax plan this weekend to mixed reviews, and President Trump embarked on a tour of Asia in an effort to ostensibly reach a diplomatic solution on North Korea. However, many investors will be paying close attention to Trump’s comments on North Korea, which have been quite inflammatory in the past. Heading into the open, Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are up 0.12%, S&P 500 futures have risen 0.02% and Nasdaq-100 futures are up 0.07%. On the options front, volume remained brisk on Friday, with about 19.8 million calls and 15.7 million puts changing hands on the session. On the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio fell to 0.60, while the 10-day moving average held at 0.64. Taking a closer look at Friday’s options activity, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) call options gained considerable traction after the company saw non-iPhone sales rise 24%. Meanwhile, Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) options speculation surged as rumors hit that Broadcom Ltd (NASDAQ:AVGO) was planning a $100 billion-plus bid for the chipmaker. Finally, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) had its “production hell” quip thrown back in its face after poor third-quarter earnings.  Apple silenced quite a few bears last week when it beat third-quarter earnings expectations. While iPhone sales still remain below historical levels, the company banked on a 24% jump in non-iPhone sales, which came in at $23.1 billion on the quarter. Apple also set iPhone deliveries within expectations following the launch of the iPhone X last week. That said, some analysts were quick to point out that Wall Street’s expectations had fallen since the September iPhone 8 event, and that these lowered expectations were the only reason Apple was able to turn in an earnings beat. Options traders were happy with the results, however, as calls made up an above average 67% of Friday’s take, which came in at more than 1.4 million contracts. However, the November put/call open interest ratio of 0.80 indicates that there are still more than a few bears betting that AAPL stock is due for a pullback. In fact, put OI has ballooned to more than 15,500 contracts at the $165 strike, with another 40,000 at the Nov $160 strike.

Latest evolution in the price of Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock has been one of the most talked about matter among the interested investors. It is widely believed that a stock’s future performance can best be predicted by analyzing prior trends and patterns in price. In the case of TSLA, the chart has some interesting things to say about where the stock might be headed in the future. How has the stock performed recently? Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in the last month has decreased -14.23%. Shares are now up over the past year, outperforming the broad market by -100% and underperformed a peer group of similar companies by -10%. After the latest session, which saw the stock close at a price of $306.09, TSLA sits below its 52-week high. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) has been trading in a bullish manner, based on the relative positions of the stock’s 20 and 200 day moving averages. Momentum indicators 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that TSLA may be headed in the future. In order to predict this, technical analysts look at momentum indicators, which measure the speed and magnitude of these price movements. The idea is that as momentum slows, it may signal the approach of key support or resistance levels and a reversal of recent trends. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for TSLA is 36.02%, which suggests that the stock is not particularly expensive or cheap, and not predisposed to a reactive price movement based on this measure. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 12.70%, tells a different story, and suggests that TSLA currently trades in oversold territory. What do the trading volumes reveal? Price isn’t the only tool analysts use to forecast future performance. Volume patterns can also reveal some important insights. If, for instance, a stock’s volumes suddenly increase by a significant amount, it’s usually a sign that the level of conviction behind the trade is high. Investors may feel very strongly about the future direction of the stock in question. Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) average trading volume of 6,405,215 during the past month is 1.34% below its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been less active than usual in the stock in recent times. What do the analysts think? TSLA is currently undervalued by -5.38% relative to the average 1-year price target of $323.48 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 2.80, which implies that analysts are generally neutral in their outlook for TSLA over the next year. How risky is the stock?  When analyzing a stock’s price performance, it’s essential to take risk into account. Beta, which measures a stock’s volatility relative to the overall market, can be used to gauge the level of systematic risk associated with a particular stock. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) has a beta of 1.02, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are more extreme than the market as a whole. TSLA therefore has a above average level of market risk. During the past couple of weeks, TSLA average daily volatility was 41.19%, which is -2.88 percentage points higher than the average volatility over the past 100 days.

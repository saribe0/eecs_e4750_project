After previously competing in four games for the regular season, the UAA hockey team made their conference debut last weekend, Nov. 3-4. UAA traveled to Michigan for back-to-back games against Lake Superior State. Prior to the weekend duel, both teams had a total of five loses for the season, with Lake Superior State only leading the Seawolves by one win. However, Lake Superior got a head start with their Western Collegiate Hockey Association games, with one more than UAA. Post-games, both the Seawolves and Lake Superior sit near the bottom of the standings of WCHA standings at eighth and seventh, respectively. At the top of the standings is Bowling Green State University, with three conference wins and one conference loss. Right behind them is Minnesota State and Northern Michigan. The Seawolves got off to an exceptionally slow start on Friday. The first period resulted in no points made by either team. It wasn’t until the last 30 seconds of the second period that UAA took over. Junior forward Nicolas Erb-Ekholm used a power play to score the first UAA goal of the night and his second goal of the season. Erb-Ekholm’s goal wouldn’t have been possible if it weren’t for Nathan and Jonah Renouf assisting the play. The Seawolves maintained their lead for the majority of the second period until Lake Superior’s Anthony Nellis scored at nearly 17 minutes in the second period, bringing the game to a tie. Not long after, a power-play goal took Lake Superior into the lead, early in the third period. UAA’s freshman defenseman Cameron Trott scored late in the third period, with the power-play score tying it up for the rest of the third. Lake Superior’s Max Humitz scored at 3:38 in the first overtime to overtake the Seawolves, and win the game 3-2. UAA came back Saturday to seek redemption. After the Game 1 loss, the Seawolves made a comeback with a win of 4-1. The start of the game resulted in senior forward Tad Kozun being the first to score for the night, barely a minute into the game. His goal served as a rebound from the attempted shot by junior forward Cam Amantea. Tanner Johnson also assisted on the goal. Similar to the first period of the Friday night game, the second period of Saturday’s game stood at a stand still, without either team making a point. It wasn’t until just two minutes into the third period that the Seawolves came back strong. Senior forward Austin Azurdia managed to get his first goal of the night that put UAA up 2-0, assisted by defensemen Eric Sinclair and goaltender Olivier Mantha. For another four minutes, the Seawolves kept their defense up and maintained the 2-0 lead. Six minutes later, Lake Superior’s Jake Hand managed a power play that put the game a 2-1. Quickly after, junior forward Jeremiah Luedtke and Kozun initiated a set-up for Azurdia to successfully make his second goal of the night. The Seawolves regained their two point lead, and had less than 10 minutes in the game. Luedtke still managed to put in one more goal before the end of the night to close out the game win with just two minutes remaining. The win couldn’t have happened without the 34 saves accumulated by senior goaltender Mantha. With one win and one loss for the weekend, the Seawolves currently sit at a tie for eighth in the conference. UAA hockey will be back in action on Nov. 10 and 11 with away games against Alabama-Huntsville. The following weekend the Seawolves will return home to the Sullivan arena to host back-to-back home games versus Michigan Tech.

The men’s soccer team snagged the UAA title with a 2–1 win against Wash U on Saturday. The victory was one for the books, as it marked the team’s annual senior day and gave the Maroons an automatic bid for the NCAA DIII tournament, their third in three years. The victory advanced the team’s overall record to 16–2. Game leaders included third-year forwards Matthew Koh with one goal and Max Lopez with one goal and one assist.  In response to the team’s performance on Saturday, second-year forward Dayo Adeosun said, “As a team, we are proud of the way we started off the game. We did well connecting the early vital passes needed for the team to get a flow.” Winning a UAA championship was an important goal for the Maroons this year, and securing the win on senior day made it that much better.  “Obviously, it is always a great feeling beating [our] conference rival Wash U,” said second-year defender Nate Johnson. “But what made it even more special was that we did it for our four seniors on Senior Day.” Although proud of the win, the Maroons are far from satisfied. Moving forward, they are looking to improve ball movement and vary their points of attack. After coming up short and losing in the third round of the National Tournament last year, the Maroons are looking to redeem themselves and bring home the gold.  “Moving into the postseason, it is always an exciting feeling,” Johnson added. “Last season we came up short, so there is definitely something that the three returning classes want to get back. We know we are a championship-caliber team, and we have a lot to prove both as a team and as a program.” Adeosun echoes his teammates sentiments, “At this point we are confident that if we continue to persistently focus in practice and understand that every moment matters, then we have a great chance to win it all. Ultimately, the national championship has been our goal since the beginning of the season, and we are determined to accomplish that.” The NCAA selection show is scheduled for 12:30 p.m. on November 6. The Maroons will find out where they are seeded and will likely play in the opening round on either November 10 or November 11.  “Following the excitement of the win over Wash U, we have a lot of motivation moving forward into the first round of the tournament this weekend,” Johnson said. “It is going to be exciting to find out our seed and prepare for our road to the Final Four.” The Maroons have an exciting week ahead of them with one goal in mind: winning a national championship.

 The nation's 12th-ranked Division I women's basketball team clobbered the nation's fourth-ranked Division II team Sunday, but the Duke Blue Devils couldn't stop UAA's Hannah Wandersee.  A 6-foot-1 junior from Kodiak, Wandersee had the best game of her college career in UAA's 87-56 exhibition loss at Cameron Indoor Stadium in Durham, North Carolina.  She put up the second double-double of her career — 19 point and 10 rebounds — and blocked four shots.  "We have been waiting for a breakout game from her like this," UAA coach Ryan McCarthy said in a press release from UAA. "(W)e just didn't realize it would come against Duke at Cameron Indoor Stadium."  Wandersee connected on 9 of 16 shots from the field and added two steals to lead the Seawolves, who got in trouble early.  Duke raced to a 10-0 lead, a burst that began with a wide-open 3-pointer by Lexie Brown, a two-time All-America guard. A 5-9 senior, Brown poured in 27 points on 10-of-17 shooting, with many of her points coming in transition.  Duke's speed and size proved fatal to the Seawolves, who surrendered 20 fast-break points and were outrebounded 48-34.  UAA responded to Duke's fast start with a 3-pointer by Shelby Cloninger and a jumper by Sydni Stallworth to make it 10-5, but the Blue Devils led 26-13 at the end of the first quarter and 49-28 at the half.  "This was a tremendous opportunity for us to test ourselves against incredible athletes at the highest level of our sport," McCarthy said. "I'm really proud of the effort our ladies showed today – they did not back down an inch. Hannah's effort was especially impressive."  Wandersee's only other double-double came in her freshman season when she posted 22 points and 11 rebounds against New Hope Christian, an Oregon school that belongs to the National Christian College Athletic Association.  Cloninger hit three of her six shots behind the arc to finish with 11 points for the Seawolves, who also got five points, four rebounds, four assists and two steals from Rodericka Ware.  Rebecca Greenwell, Brown's backcourt mate, dropped in 20 points to go with seven rebounds, six assists and five steals for the Blue Devils.  The Seawolves play their first games against Division II opponents this week at the Wildcat Crossover Tournament in Ellensburg, Washington. UAA faces Hawaii Pacific at 11 a.m. AST Friday and Cal State Los Angeles at noon AST Saturday.

Analyst ratings can sometimes be complicated, and we here at ETF Channel have noticed a bit of a paradox with Under Armour Inc (Symbol: UAA). The average 12-month price target for UAA - averaging the work of 25 analysts - reveals an average price target of $13.78/share. That's a whopping 18.69% above where UAA has been trading recently at $11.61/share. With this kind of capital gain potential (should UAA reach that price target), one might expect to see a high concentration of "buy" or even "strong buy" ratings on the stock. Yet, take a look at the bearishness:     10 ETFs With Most Upside To Analyst Targets »

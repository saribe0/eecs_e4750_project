http://www.nasdaq.com/article/interesting-november-stock-options-for-wmt-cm872410

Consistently, one of the more popular stocks people enter into their stock options watchlist at Stock Options Channel is Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (Symbol: WMT). So this week we highlight one interesting put contract, and one interesting call contract, from the November expiration for WMT. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting, is at the $87 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of 77 cents. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 0.9% return against the $87 commitment, or a 29.4% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost ).      Turning to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the November expiration, for shareholders of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (Symbol: WMT) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 2.3% annualized dividend yield. Selling the covered call at the $91 strike and collecting the premium based on the 85 cents bid, annualizes to an additional 31.6% rate of return against the current stock price (this is what we at Stock Options Channel refer to as the YieldBoost ), for a total of 33.9% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $91 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but WMT shares would have to advance 2.1% from current levels for that to happen, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 3% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.

The recent progress in the stock of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has alerted everyone to look out for right opportunity to invest. Analysts often use price and volume data to predict future stock performance. In the case of WMT, the chart has some interesting things to say about where the stock might be headed. How has the stock performed recently? Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) in the last month has increased +13.52%. Shares are now up over the past year, outperforming the broad market by -100% and outperformed a peer group of similar companies by 198%. After the latest session, which saw the stock close at a price of $89.68, WMT sits below its 52-week high. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has been trading in a bullish manner, based on the relative positions of the stock’s 20 and 200 day moving averages. Momentum indicators 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that WMT may be headed in the future. Fortunately, there is way to use the speed and magnitude of these price changes to predict future performance, thanks to what are known as momentum indicators. As momentum slows, it might be a sign that a support or resistance level has been reached, and that a trend is about to reverse. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for WMT is 71.05%, which suggests that the stock may be primed for a trend reversal or a corrective pullback in price. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 94.66%, tells a similar story, and suggests that WMT currently trades in overbought territory. What do the trading volumes reveal? Price isn’t the only tool analysts use to forecast future performance. Volume patterns can also reveal some important insights. If, for instance, a stock’s volumes suddenly increase by a significant amount, it’s usually a sign that the level of conviction behind the trade is high. Investors may feel very strongly about the future direction of the stock in question. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) average trading volume of 9,172,035 during the past month is 5.02% above its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been more active than usual in the stock in recent times. What do the analysts think? WMT is currently overvalued by 3.15% relative to the average 1-year price target of $86.94 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 2.40, which implies that analysts are generally neutral in their outlook for WMT over the next year. How risky is the stock?  When analyzing a stock’s price performance, it’s essential to take risk into account. Beta, which measures a stock’s volatility relative to the overall market, can be used to gauge the level of systematic risk associated with a particular stock. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has a beta of 0.34, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are less extreme than the market as a whole. WMT therefore has a below average level of market risk. During the past couple of weeks, WMT average daily volatility was 11.68%, which is 3.38 percentage points lower than the average volatility over the past 100 days.

https://simplywall.st/news/2017/11/07/how-wal-mart-stores-inc-wmt-delivered-a-better-roe-than-its-industry/

 Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT) outperformed the hypermarkets and super centers industry on the basis of its ROE – producing a higher 17.00% relative to the peer average of 12.67% over the past 12 months. Though, the impressiveness of WMT’s ROE is contingent on whether this industry-beating level can be sustained. A measure of sustainable returns is WMT’s financial leverage. If WMT borrows debt to invest in its business, its profits will be higher. But ROE does not capture any debt, so we only see high profits and low equity, which is great on the surface. But today let’s take a deeper dive below this surface. View our latest analysis for Wal-Mart Stores   Return on Equity (ROE) is a measure of WMT’s profit relative to its shareholders’ equity. An ROE of 17.00% implies $0.17 returned on every $1 invested, so the higher the return, the better. Investors seeking to maximise their return in the Hypermarkets and Super Centers industry may want to choose the highest returning stock. However, this can be misleading as each firm has different costs of equity and debt levels i.e. the more debt WMT has, the higher ROE is pumped up in the short term, at the expense of long term interest payment burden. Return on Equity = Net Profit ÷ Shareholders Equity  Returns are usually compared to costs to measure the efficiency of capital. WMT’s cost of equity is 8.49%. Given a positive discrepancy of 8.50% between return and cost, this indicates that WMT pays less for its capital than what it generates in return, which is a sign of capital efficiency. ROE can be broken down into three different ratios: net profit margin, asset turnover, and financial leverage. This is called the Dupont Formula: ROE = profit margin × asset turnover × financial leverage ROE = (annual net profit ÷ sales) × (sales ÷ assets) × (assets ÷ shareholders’ equity) ROE = annual net profit ÷ shareholders’ equity  The first component is profit margin, which measures how much of sales is retained after the company pays for all its expenses. Asset turnover reveals how much revenue can be generated from WMT’s asset base. The most interesting ratio, and reflective of sustainability of its ROE, is financial leverage. ROE can be inflated by disproportionately high levels of debt. This is also unsustainable due to the high interest cost that the company will also incur. Thus, we should look at WMT’s debt-to-equity ratio to examine sustainability of its returns. The most recent ratio is 60.72%, which is sensible and indicates WMT has not taken on too much leverage. Thus, we can conclude its above-average ROE is generated from its capacity to increase profit without a large debt burden.   While ROE is a relatively simple calculation, it can be broken down into different ratios, each telling a different story about the strengths and weaknesses of a company. WMT exhibits a strong ROE against its peers, as well as sufficient returns to cover its cost of equity. Its high ROE is not likely to be driven by high debt. Therefore, investors may have more confidence in the sustainability of this level of returns going forward. Though there are other vital factors we need to consider before we conclude whether or not WMT’s returns are sustainable.

Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Dollar Tree, Inc. (NYSE:DLTR) are both Services companies that recently hit new low. This price action has ruffled more than a few feathers in the investment community, but is one a better investment than the other? To answer this, we will compare the two companies across growth, profitability, risk, return, dividends, and valuation measures. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) operates in the Discount, Variety Stores segment of the Services sector. The company has grown sales at a 1.70% annual rate over the past five years, putting it in the low growth category. WMT has a net profit margin of 2.60% and is more profitable than the average company in the Discount, Variety Stores industry. In terms of efficiency, WMT has an asset turnover ratio of 2.43.

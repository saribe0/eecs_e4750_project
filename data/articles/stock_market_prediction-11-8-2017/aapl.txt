When Apple Inc. dropped Imagination Technologies Group Plc as a supplier for iPhone technology, the British chip designer’s shares plunged as much as 69 percent and the company ultimately accepted a buyout. But the U.K.’s Dialog Semiconductor Plc, which relies on Apple for about three-quarters of its revenue, isn’t worried. Following strong third-quarter earnings, Dialog Chief Executive Officer Jalal Bagherli dismissed concerns Tuesday, saying his company and Imagination have little in common other than sharing similar customers. “If someone were to not use us they’d have to create 1,000 highly-skilled power management engineers to really replicate what we do,” Bagherli said in an interview. He said this is in contrast to Imagination, which designs technology for customers to manufacture themselves, rather than being a supplier of usable components. The semiconductor industry has seen much consolidation over the past two years and the U.K. has been a notable target. In addition to Imagination’s sale, U.K. chip designer ARM Holdings Plc was snapped up by SoftBank Group Corp. for $32 billion. Elsewhere, Dutch chipmaker NXP Semiconductors NV is the target of what was once the industry’s biggest-ever deal when Qualcomm Inc. proposed a $47 billion buyout in November last year. Qualcomm itself this week received an unsolicited $105 billion bid from Broadcom Ltd. Bagherli doesn’t see the latter acquisition posing a significant threat to Dialog. “They’re primarily digital companies so really they’re not in areas where they impact our business directly,” he said of Qualcomm and Broadcom. “If they pull that off it creates a very large semiconductor company that competes at a much more significant level with established players like Intel Corp.” The CEO also said his company’s $276 million acquisition of U.S. startup Silego Technology Inc. was completed on Nov. 1, and is forecast to grow 15 percent next year as Dialog makes a bigger push into the connected devices, or “Internet of Things” market. “From a diversification point of view, our strategy is working,” Bagherli said when asked about the risk of having one customer account for as much as 74 percent of its revenue. “Our investment in Bluetooth connectivity is going through the roof, and now we added Silego, which is a unique technology pillar we can offer to a range of customers rather than a single customer.” Bagherli wouldn’t mention his company’s biggest customer by name, nor did he mention the iPhone X directly. But he did suggest some reports that the California-based company had cut orders of components for its new flagship smartphone were either inaccurate or irrelevant to Dialog’s business. He said the company’s third-quarter revenue of $363 million was 2 percent above the midpoint of guidance issued in July. “If it was really halved or doubled,” Bagherli said of iPhone component orders, “we would have really underperformed on our guidance massively, or overperformed massively.” “It’s more difficult to predict the extent of the popularity but everything we see is positive,” he said. “We’ve got a strong backlog and hence we are guiding towards being 19 percent up year-on-year in the fourth quarter.” On Tuesday, Dialog reported revenue that met the average analyst estimate, with adjusted operating profit of $76.6 million. It sees fourth-quarter revenue of $415 million to $455 million, with a strong backlog of orders.

How much will cost to replace a damaged iPhone X? The short answer: up to more than half the cost of buying a new device, according to Statista.  Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL)'s iPhone X starts at $999 for a base model 64GB device and moves up in price for higher storage. This makes the iPhone X the most expensive iPhone to date, yet it appears that demand for the phone outpaces supply. Apple began accepting pre-orders for the iPhone X last week and it sold out within minutes. The estimated delivery time now stands at five to six weeks. The lucky few who will have an iPhone X in their hands in a few weeks' time are naturally cautioned not to drop or break the phone, because it will be pricey. Apple's official screen repair service for the iPhone X will cost consumers $279, and damage beyond the screen will set consumers back $549, Statista said. By comparison, a screen repair for the iPhone 8 Plus costs $169, and $399 if damage extends beyond the screen. The cheapest screen to repair is the iPhone SE at $129, or $269 for extensive damage.  You will find more statistics at Statista.

 Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) reported its fiscal fourth-quarter financial results after the markets closed on Thursday. This stock does not seem like it can be stopped on its race higher, and analysts are cheering it the whole way. A couple of analysts were on the sidelines for this quarter and how the next generation of iPhone would be received, but ultimately their faith was rewarded and Apple stock again hit an all-time high. 24/7 Wall St. has included some brief highlights from the earnings report, as well as what some analysts are saying after the fact. Apple posted $2.07 in earnings per share (EPS) on $52.6 billion in revenue, versus consensus estimates from Thomson Reuters for $1.87 per share and $50.79 billion. In the same period of last year, the iPhone maker said it had EPS of $1.50 and $46.85 billion in revenue. The company reported individual segments as follows: In terms of the guidance for the fiscal first quarter, Apple expects to see revenues in the range of $84 billion to $87 billion, with a gross margin in the range of 38.0% to 38.5%. The consensus estimates are $3.77 in EPS and $85.31 billion in revenue for the current quarter. Canaccord Genuity’s Michael Walkley believes that Apple will continue growing its leading market share of the premium-tier smartphone market with double-digit growth of its installed base during the quarter, and also that the iPhone installed base will surpass 635 million by the end of 2017. The firm raised its price target to $195 based on an expected stronger upgrade cycle in 2018 and a high average selling price for the iPhone X. A few other analysts weighed in on Apple after earnings were released: Shares of Apple closed Friday up 2.6% at $172.50, with a consensus analyst price target of $181.64 and a 52-week trading range of $104.08 to $174.26.

 AAPL  Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report)	 stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Apple has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18.9, as you can see in the chart below:  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 20.7. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts Apple’s current PE ratio marginally somewhat above its midpoint (which is 13.4) over the past five years.  Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 23.9. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.  We should also point out that Apple has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 15.7, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Apple’s stock in the near term too.P/CF RatioAn often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price/cash flow metric. This ratio doesn’t take amortization and depreciation into account, so can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business. This is a preferred metric to some valuation investors because cash flows are (a) generally less prone to manipulation by the company’s management and (b) are less affected by variation in accounting policies between different companies.The ratio is generally applied to find out whether a company’s stock is overpriced or underpriced with reference to its cash flows generation potential compared with its competitors. However, it is not commonly used for cross-industry comparison, as the average price to cash flow ratio varies from industry to industry.In this case, Apple’s P/CF ratio of 15.4 is higher than the industry average of 12.9, which indicates that the stock is somewhat overvalued in this respect.  Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Apple currently has a Value Style Score of ‘B’, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes AAPL a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Apple is just 1.4, a level that is noticeably lower than the industry average of 3.2. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Clearly, AAPL is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Apple might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of F and a Momentum score of A. This gives AAPL a VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of C. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging. The current quarter has seen four estimates go higher in the past sixty days and four lower, while the full year estimate has seen six upward and four downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a favorable impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen about 3.5% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has increased approximately 3.3%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below: Apple Inc. Price and Consensus     Apple Inc. Price and Consensus | Apple Inc. Quote The stock holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which indicates expectations of in-line performance from the company in the near term. However, Apple is enjoying bullish analyst sentiment, as indicated by the positive estimate revisions, and this works in the company’s favor.Bottom LineApple is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (bottom 22% out of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. Nonetheless, over the past one year, the sector has clearly outperformed the broader market, as you can see below:  So, value investors might want to wait for the broader factors to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.

https://stocknewsgazette.com/2017/11/07/what-do-insider-trends-have-to-say-about-apple-inc-aapl/

Recent insider trends for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) have caught the attention of investors. Patters in insider activity can help analysts formulate an outlook for a stock. In the case of AAPL, the data has a lot to say about how the stock might perform going forward. Institutions own 61.73% of Apple Inc. (AAPL)’s shares. The total value of these holdings, in millions, is $546,700. Among active positions in the latest quarter, 948 holders increased their positions by a total of 74.39 million shares, 1,441 holders decreased the positions by a total of 148.99 million shares, and 200 holders held their positions. This works out to a net decrease in ownership of 74.6 million shares, and suggests that institutions are feeling bearish about the stock. Among new and sold out positions, 91 holders initiated new positions by a total of 7.81 million shares and 71 holders exited their positions by a total of 22.24 million shares. This nets out to a decrease of 14.43 million shares and is another bearish sign for AAPL. In the last three months, insiders executed a total of 25 trades. 2 of these were buys and 23 were sells. Insider ownership decreased by a total of 1.27 million shares, which suggests that AAPL’s key executives are feeling less optimistic about the outlook for the stock. The data from the past twelve months tells a similar story: insiders executed 4 buys and 101 sells, and ownership decreased by a net of 3.11 million shares. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 The analysis of insider buying and selling trends can be extended to the aggregate level. Short interest, which represents the number of a stock’s shares currently being shorted, captures what the market as a whole feels about a stock. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s short interest is 34.24 million shares, or % of the float. This represents a decrease of -10% in the number of shares being shorted compared to the previous reading, and implies that investors felt less pessimistic about the stock during the past two weeks. Given what the insider ownership patterns are saying, it makes sense to consider the technicals to see if these pieces of information reach the same conclusion about the outlook for AAPL. A composite of 13 technical indicators that includes measures such as moving averages and momentum oscillators suggests that AAPL is a Strong buy, which implies that AAPL is expected to outperform the market based on prior trading patterns. Conclusion 
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Institutional ownership trends suggest that the stock is cheap and the insider trading data indicates that insiders are bearish. Technical indicators (also) suggest that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is undervalued.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) is an interesting player in the Consumer Goods space, with a focus on Electronic Equipment. The stock has been active on the tape, currently trading at $174.25, up from yesterday’s close by 1.01%. Given the stock’s recent action, it seemed like a good time to take a closer look at the company’s recent data. Fundamental Analysis This company has been competing with others in the Consumer Goods space and offers its own combination of interesting factors Apple Inc. (AAPL) currently trades with a market capitalization of $877.14 Billion. That value represents a market adjusting for revenues that have been growing by 7.20 % on a quarterly year/year basis as of the company’s last quarterly report. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For AAPL, the company currently has $19.15 Billion of cash on the books, which is offset by $18.47 Billion current liabilities. You can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $51.15 Billion over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to grow in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $1.87 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 62.72% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors.

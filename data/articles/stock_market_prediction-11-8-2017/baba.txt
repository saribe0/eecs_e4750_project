U.S. stock futures are mixed this morning, as Wall Street eyes another round of corporate earnings and positive retail data out of the Eurozone. Specifically, Eurozone retail sales rose 3.7% in September year-over-year, topping estimates for a 2.9% gain. Meanwhile, in earnings, Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc (NYSE:VRX) will be in focus after gaining ground and heavy options activity yesterday. Heading into the open, Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are up 0.09%, S&P 500 futures have dipped 0.03% and Nasdaq-100 futures are off 0.03%. On the options front, volume lightened up a bit on Monday, but remained well above October’s daily average. Overall, about 17.2 million calls and 13.4 million puts changed hands on the session. On the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio ticked higher to 0.61, but the 10-day moving average slipped to a one-month low of 0.63. As for Monday’s most active option, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA) attracted heavy call options volume after Oppenheimer boosted its price target on BABA stock. Meanwhile Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (ADR) (NYSE:TEVA) surged despite a price-target cut at Credit Suisse after reports emerged that billionaire Len Blavatnik was looking to acquire a stake. Finally, Valeant Pharmaceuticals gained an influx of call activity amid earnings speculation and news the company was divesting Sprout Pharmaceuticals.  Alibaba posted blowout earnings last week, once again putting Wall Street’s estimates to shame. The brokerage bunch has been playing catch-up ever since, with Oppenheimer joining the bullish chorus on Monday. Analysts at the firm lifted their price target on BABA stock to $220 from $200, noting that the company was “uniquely positioned to benefit from the rise of Chinese middle-class consumption.” BABA stock rose more than 2.5% on the increase, and options traders continued to scarf down calls as a result. Volume topped 199,000 contracts, with calls accounting for 68% of the day’s take. Overall, the November put/call open interest ratio has fallen from last week’s pre-earnings perch of 0.63 to today’s reading of 0.51. Calls are clearly being added at a faster rate than puts, indicating that traders are ramping up bullish expectations ahead of Singles Day.

https://investorplace.com/2017/11/alibaba-group-holding-ltd-earnings-beat-cant-hide-warts/

Absolutely no questions exist — Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA) has been a monster investment. Year-to-date, the BABA stock price at just under $185 gained over 110%. In market capitalization terms, Alibaba added roughly a quarter-trillion dollars. All signs are a go in its quest to dethrone Amazon.com,Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). But should late-to-the-game investors buy into this rally or simply let it go? A review of Alibaba’s second-quarter performance gives you great reads.  Against a consensus earnings-per-share forecast of $6.85, BABA stock came in at $8.57, or a 25.2% positive surprise. More impressively, Alibaba’s year-ago Q2 EPS was $5.26, resulting in a 63% jump. Furthermore, when Alibaba beats, it beats big. Since Q1 of 2015, BABA’s average positive surprise is 15.4%. Additionally, the margins are improving significantly in recent quarters. On the revenue front, BABA is a steamroller. According to Bloomberg, the e-commerce giant reported its “fastest pace of sales” since its 2014 initial public offering. CEO Jack Ma’s plan is to reinvigorate China’s 4 trillion-yuan retail market, currently mired in antiquated ways. The company is enlisting “half a million mom-and-pop shops as part of a drive to woo customers both online and in-store as it opens its wallet to boost services to merchants on its platform.” Additionally, momentum is surging into Alibaba’s cloud-computing business. In Q2, cloud sales doubled, putting pressure on Amazon, and regional rival Tencent Holdings Ltd (OTCMKTS:TCEHY). In theory, all of these developments are strong positives for the BABA stock price. However, theory and actuality clashed in the markets. After jumping to an early lead, BABA stock closed out the November 2 session down nearly 0.7% against the prior. Is this a mere blip — or an early-warning signal? Internet forums are rife with positive comments about BABA stock, as they should be. The e-retailer was a massively profitable pick, particularly if you had gotten in at the bottom of 2016. Again, no one’s disputing the success; rather, the debate centers on whether or not any juice remains. So far, investors have ignored the company’s warts as the BABA stock price soared to record highs. But if you look close enough, they exist. One of Alibaba’s ongoing credibility concerns is fake products. Like our own fake news scandals, Alibaba has consistently fought allegations that it turns a blind eye to counterfeiting. But taking a page out of the fake news playbook, many of the accusations carry nuggets of truth. For one thing, the consistency of the accusations alone raises eyebrows. More critically, China runs a counterfeit economy that totals $400 billion. From shoes to electronics to even medication, Chinese copycats mimic anything and everything. Needless to say, they cost American companies billions of dollars. It’s not just black market goods that potential buyers of BABA stock should worry about. Take a look at Jianghuai Auto Corporation’s 4R3 and tell me that’s not a cheapo imitation of Ford Motor Company‘s (NYSE:F) F-150 truck.

U.S. stock futures are trending lower this morning, as Wall Street digests a deluge of data. Investors are currently mulling over President Donald Trump’s choice for Federal Reserve Chairman and awaiting the unveiling of a House Republican tax bill. Meanwhile, the Bank of England is expected to hike interest rates for the first time in a decade. On the earnings front Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) reported earnings last night, while Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is slated to take the stage after the close this afternoon. Against this crowded backdrop, Dow Jones Industrial Average futures have gained 0.07%, with S&P 500 futures up 0.02% and Nasdaq-100 futures up 0.05%. On the options front, volume was heavy on Monday, as about 18.4 million calls and 14.6 million puts changed hands yesterday. On the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio rose to 0.71, while the 10-day moving average held ticked lower to 0.64. Taking a closer look at Wednesday’s options activity, Facebook and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA) both drew heavy call volume ahead of their respective quarterly report, though both stocks are moving in opposite directions this morning. Meanwhile, United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) also saw a spike in call activity after beating third-quarter expectations and raising guidance.  After the close yesterday, Facebook said that third-quarter earnings rose 77% to $1.59 per share, blowing past Wall Street’s estimates by 31 cents per share. Revenue rose 47% to $10.33 billion, also topping the consensus for $9.84 billion. However, these impressive figures were overshadowed by increased spending, with Facebook saying it expects costs and expenses to grow 45% to 60% in 2018. Concerns over spending have pushed FB stock down in premarket trading. FB options traders were quite optimistic heading into the report, as calls made up 71% of the more than 647,000 contracts traded yesterday. Some of this seemingly bullish activity may have been profit taking ahead of the event, as the November put/call open interest ratio rose to 0.74 from 0.71 earlier in the week. So far, FB stock appears to be holding support near $180, but a breach of this region could add fuel to the downside.

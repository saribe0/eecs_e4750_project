Recent price movements in the stock of Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) have caught the attention of the investment community. It is widely believed that a stock’s future performance can best be predicted by analyzing prior trends and patterns in price. In the case of BAC, the chart has some interesting things to say about where the stock might be headed in the future. How has the stock performed recently? Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) in the last month has increased +6.14%. Shares are now up over the past year, outperforming the broad market by -100% and outperformed a peer group of similar companies by 121%. After the latest session, which saw the stock close at a price of $27.82, BAC sits below its 52-week high. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) has been trading in a bullish manner, based on the relative positions of the stock’s 20 and 200 day moving averages. Momentum indicators 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that BAC may be headed in the future. To forecast a stock’s future performance, analysts use momentum indicators, which take into account the size and speed of these price movements. As momentum begins to slow, it may be a sign that a recent trend is about to reverse. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for BAC is 69.00%, which suggests that the stock is not particularly expensive or cheap, and not predisposed to a reactive price movement based on this measure. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 91.61%, tells a different story, and suggests that BAC currently trades in overbought territory. What do the trading volumes reveal? Price isn’t the only tool analysts use to forecast future performance. Volume patterns can also reveal some important insights. If, for instance, a stock’s volumes suddenly increase by a significant amount, it’s usually a sign that the level of conviction behind the trade is high. Investors may feel very strongly about the future direction of the stock in question. Bank of America Corporation (BAC) average trading volume of 62,215,156 during the past month is 21.05% below its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been less active than usual in the stock in recent times. What do the analysts think? BAC is currently undervalued by -1.07% relative to the average 1-year price target of $28.12 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 2.10, which implies that analysts are generally neutral in their outlook for BAC over the next year. How risky is the stock?  In order to put BAC’s recent price performance into context, we need to get a sense of how the stock moves in relation to the overall market. Beta, which measures a stock’s price volatility relative to the market, provides the cleanest measure of systematic risk for a stock. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) has a beta of 1.32, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are more extreme than the market as a whole. BAC therefore has a above average level of market risk. During the past couple of weeks, BAC average daily volatility was 13.43%, which is 5.15 percentage points lower than the average volatility over the past 100 days.

Banks have had  nice moves higher over the past year, but nicer still were the moves in the TARP warrants. To review, as part of the TARP bailouts during the financial crisis, the government received warrants on lenders' common stock. The Treasury began selling these warrants in 2009, providing bank bulls with a leveraged way to play the recovery. "If the subprime credit-default swaps were this asymmetric, beautiful investment to express what was wrong with American capitalism…, these securities are the opposite,” says one hedge funder, whose firm bought about $200M of Bank of America's (NYSE:BAC) TARP warrants. BofA is higher by more than 50% since the 2016 election; the TARP warrants are up more than 200%. Similar moves are being seen in Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), and PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC), among others. An investment in the warrants of Zions Bancorp (NASDAQ:ZION) in 2013 is up 740% since vs. about a 150% rally in the common stock.

Shares of Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) are now higher by more than 25% year-to-date and looking strong. Helped by a spike in interest rates — as a result of a marginally more hawkish Federal Reserve and other G4 central banks — BAC stock has staged a technically sound breakout that could move higher. Like I always say in this here column, without the proper perspective on the markets any given trader or investor over time will likely stand to give back a large chunk of his or her gains. As such, the current shift in central bank posturing is crucial for investors and trades focusing on banking and other financial stocks. Over the past days, weeks and even months we have heard from a multitude of important central banks that they are slowly shifting to a more hawkish tone, if only moderately so. On the multi-year weekly chart, we see that BAC stock (top part of the chart) dropped sharply along with the rest of financial companies and indeed the broader market during the 2008/2009 financial crisis. After years of “basing,” BofA blasted higher following the U.S. election, and by so doing scored a technical breakout. Upside momentum however quickly again began to wane and the stock didn’t do much for bullish investors from early March until this past September. After a prolonged period of rest BAC stock in September finally took the next leg higher, which now looks to have further upside. 
Click to Enlarge Moving averages legend: red – 200 week, blue – 100 week, yellow – 50 week At the bottom of the chart, in blue, I plotted a ratio chart of the Financial Select SPDR (NYSEARCA:XLF) versus the S&P 500’s SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY). On this chart we see that the relative strength of financial stocks as a group has improved versus the broader large-cap market and indeed now looks giddy to break higher. In other words, BAC stock could be in for a period of not only absolute but also relative strength in the broader picture. 
Click to Enlarge Moving averages legend: red – 200 day, blue – 100 day, yellow – 50 day Moving on to the daily chart we see that as a result of the September breakout of the multi-quarter consolidation phase (black lines), the BAC stock’s intermediate-term moving averages have all begun to curl up again, which is constructive for the time being and should all else being equal offer a layer of technical support. After the September breakout got overheated BAC stock in the second half of October started to rest again. While the stock remains in this near-term resting period, odds look favorable that ultimately a continuation-move higher sets in toward year-end. Active investors and traders could look to buy BAC around current levels in the mid to high $27s for a next upside target at $29, followed by possibly $30 — although I do not expect this move to take place in a straight line.

https://stocknewsgazette.com/2017/11/02/there-are-mixed-technical-signals-in-bank-of-america-corporation-bac/

Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) fell by -0.76% in Wednesday’s trading session from $27.60 to $27.39 and has now fallen 3 consecutive sessions. The stock price went upward in 6 of the last 10 days and has generated 4.54% during the last two weeks. There was a decrease in both volume and price. This is usually interpreted as a good sign as traders widely believe falling stock should see declining volume. Traded activity experienced a fall of -1.08 million shares and in total 50.10 M shares exchanged hands for about $1 372.26 million. Inside BAC’s Recent Trend Bank of America Corporation (BAC) lies in the middle of a wide and strong rising trend in the short term and issued considerable signs about additional rally. Short-term traders are predicted to see a rally of 14.36% over the course of a quarter and, with 90% chance the price will be floating in the range of $28.53 and $32.43 in this timeframe. Bank of America Corporation Technical Signals 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 BAC has witnessed its short term MA triggering a sell signal. Meanwhile, however, the long-term average has generated a buy signal. When the short-run moving average rises above its longer-term trend, a buy signal is created. This is because a short-run moving average that crosses its long-run moving average counterpart is seen as the initiation of an upward trend. On additional rally, the share price will meet short term resistance at around $27.57. On a drop, the stock is likely to find some support over the long run, which begins at $25.93. A buy signal will be generated if it crosses above the short term moving average. Meanwhile, however, a price crossing below the long term moving average will generate a sell signal. Some other technical concerns emerged as well, putting in risk the future growth of the stock in the next couple of days. Its pivot point high generated sell signal on Friday October 27, 2017, which calls for additional declines until the stock forms a new pivot point low, as this could be a buying opportunity. The downbeat movement of both volume and price during the recent session is interpreted as a good sign because traders usually believe falling stock should see declining volume. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) Support And Resistance Levels In case of pullback, the next support the price will capture from accumulated volume will not be far away from current price at $25.83 and $25.45. In case of gains, the next resistance from accumulated volume will not be far away from today’s level at $27.63, $27.68 and $27.80. 
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 It is important to note, however, that the stock needs to make its way through natural risk while testing a key support level. Once this support is broken, another support level will be to be established at a lower level. Turning back to this stock, Bank of America Corporation approaches the first support point just current price at $25.83. In case of a break, the next support we will see from accumulated volume is going to be at $25.45 and $23.31. Accumulated volume is going to prevent the price from rising further at $27.63 and this action will lead the price to take a temporary pause or stay muted for a few days.

http://www.nasdaq.com/article/interesting-march-2018-stock-options-for-hd-cm872463

Consistently, one of the more popular stocks people enter into their stock options watchlist  at Stock Options Channel is Home Depot Inc (Symbol: HD). So this week we highlight one interesting put contract, and one interesting call contract, from the March 2018 expiration for HD. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting, is at the $155 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $4.05. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 2.6% return against the $155 commitment, or a 7.3% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost  ).      Selling a put does not give an investor access to HD's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. So unless Home Depot Inc sees its shares decline 5.2% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $150.95 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $4.05 from $155), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 7.3% annualized rate of return.  makeArticleAd();  Interestingly, that annualized 7.3% figure actually exceeds the 2.2% annualized dividend paid by Home Depot Inc by 5.1%, based on the current share price of $163.52. And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to lose 5.24% to reach the $155 strike price.    Always important when discussing dividends is the fact that, in general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Home Depot Inc, looking at the dividend history chart for HD below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 2.2% annualized dividend yield.    Turning to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the March 2018 expiration, for shareholders of Home Depot Inc (Symbol: HD) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 2.2% annualized dividend yield. Selling the covered call at the $170 strike and collecting the premium based on the $3.95 bid, annualizes to an additional 6.8% rate of return against the current stock price (this is what we at Stock Options Channel refer to as the YieldBoost  ), for a total of 9% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $170 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but HD shares would have to advance 3.9% from current levels for that to occur, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 6.3% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.    The chart below shows the trailing twelve month trading history for Home Depot Inc, highlighting in green where the $155 strike is located relative to that history, and highlighting the $170 strike in red:       The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the March 2018 put or call options highlighted in this article deliver a rate of return that represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Home Depot Inc (considering the last 252 trading day HD historical stock prices  using closing values, as well as today's price of $163.52) to be 14%.    In mid-afternoon trading on Monday, the put volume among S&P 500 components was 1.03M contracts, with call volume at 1.77M, for a put:call ratio of 0.58 so far for the day. Compared to the long-term median put:call ratio of .65, that represents high call volume relative to puts; in other words, buyers are showing a preference for calls in  options trading  so far today.

Shares of ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) are on a recovery track as they have regained 26.53% since bottoming out on Aug. 21, 2017. Thanks to a rise of almost 4.56% in the past five days, the stock price is now up 6.66% so far on the year — still in strong territory. In this case, shares are down -0.85% , the 52-week high touched on Nov. 07, 2017, and are keeping their losses at 21.77% for the past 12 months.  Brokerage houses, on average, are recommending investors to buy ConocoPhillips (COP)’s shares projecting a $53.32 target price. Analysts‟ target price forecasts are a prediction of a stock‟s future price, generally over the 12 months following the release date (Asquith et al., 2005). This forecast is a point estimate that provides investors with a benchmark against which to directly compare stock price in the short run.Target prices made by analysts employed by large brokers, who have access to a greater resource pool, are more likely to be met over the 12-month forecast period.  COP’s revenue has declined at an average annualized rate of about -17.8% during the past five years. However, the company’s most recent quarter increase of 3.4% looks unattractive. The sales growth rate for a stock is a measure of how the stock’s sales per share (SPS) has grown over a specific period of time. It tells an investor how quickly a company is increasing its revenues. The sales growth rate helps investors determine how strong the overall growth-orientation is for a stock or portfolio.   The best measure of a company is its profitability, for without it, it cannot grow, and if it doesn’t grow, then its stock will trend downward. Increasing profits are the best indication that a company can pay dividends and that the share price will trend upward. Creditors will loan money at a cheaper rate to a profitable company than to an unprofitable one; consequently, profitable companies can use leverage to increase stockholders’ equity even more. Profitability ratios compare different accounts to see how efficiently a business is generating profits. These ratios show how well income is generated through operations, and are important to both creditors and investors. They help determine the company’s ability to continue operating. Currently, ConocoPhillips net profit margin for the 12 months is at -8.62%. Comparatively, the peers have a net margin 17.01%, and the sector’s average is 98.62%. In that light, it seems in weak position compared to its peers and sector. The profit margin measures the amount of net income earned with each dollar’s worth of revenue. It shows the percentage of sales that remain after all of the company’s expenses have been paid. The higher the ratio, the better.  The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) is another stock that is grabbing investors attention these days. Its shares have trimmed -2.55% since hitting a peak level on Oct. 26, 2017. Meanwhile, due to a recent pullback which led to a fall of almost -1.24% in the past one month, the stock price is now outperforming with 22.06% so far on the year — still in strong zone. In this case, shares are 36.02% higher, the worst price in 52 weeks suffered on Nov. 09, 2016, and are keeping their losses at 3.5% for the past six months.  The good news is there’s still room for The Home Depot, Inc. (HD) to grow. At recent closing price of $163.66, HD has a chance to add $8.04 or 4.91% in 52 weeks, based on mean target price ($171.7) placed by analysts.The analyst consensus opinion of 1.9 looks like a buy. It has a 36-month beta of 1.1 , so you might be in for a bumpy ride.  For the past 5 years, The Home Depot, Inc.’s EPS growth has been nearly 21.1%. Sure, the percentage is encouraging but better times are ahead as looking out over a next 5-year period, analysts expect the company to see its earnings go up by 12.57%, annually.  The Home Depot, Inc. (HD)’s ROE is 164.51%, while industry’s is 41.23%. The average ROE for the sector stands at 13.11%. The return on equity (ROE), also known as return on investment (ROI), is the best measure of the return, since it is the product of the operating performance, asset turnover, and debt-equity management of the firm. If a firm can borrow money and use it to achieve a higher return than the cost of the debt, then the leveraging creates additional revenue that accrues to stockholders as increased equity.  The Home Depot, Inc.’s ROA is 18.62%, while industry’s average is 7.41%. As with any return, the higher this number the better. However, it, too, needs to be taken into the context of a company’s peer group as well as its sector. The average return on assets for companies in the same sector is 6.68. The return on assets (ROA) (aka return on total assets, return on average assets), is one of the most widely used profitability ratios because it is related to both profit margin and asset turnover, and shows the rate of return for both creditors and investors of the company. ROA shows how well a company controls its costs and utilizes its resources.

http://www.nasdaq.com/article/is-an-earnings-beat-in-store-for-home-depot-hd-in-q3-cm872870

 Moreover, the company has a spectacular positive earnings surprise record for five years now. For the trailing four quarters, the company has delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 3.8%. Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?
 The question lingering in investors' minds now is whether Home Depot will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is $1.81 per share, up 12.9% from the year-ago quarter. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter has moved up in the last 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks anticipate revenues of $24.4 billion, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 5.4%.  Home Depot, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Home Depot, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Home Depot, Inc. (The) Quote Moreover, we note that the stock has outperformed the industry year to date. The company's shares have increased 22.5%, while the industry grew 16.9%. This solid growth comes on the back of a spectacular surprise history and growth strategies, including an interconnected strategy and focus on Pro customers. Factors at Play
 Home Depot has been gaining from strong earnings trends, robust outlook, efforts to improve customer experience along with promising capital strategy. Additionally a recovering housing market and the rehabilitation process following the hurricanes have been aiding its performance.
 The company has been displaying solid growth across all regions, both in stores and online. Further, Pro category sales continue to outperform, driven by constant efforts to enrich customers' experiences.
 Additionally, the company's comparable store sales (comps) trend has been encouraging as it has surpassed the Zacks comps estimate for over two years now. In the most recent quarter, the company's comps improved 6.3%, surpassing the Zacks estimate of 4.7%. Comps growth was aided by robust average ticket, which also topped the Zacks Consensus mark. For the third-quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for average ticket is pegged at 61.
 Home Depot's second-quarter fiscal 2017 results gained from growth across the company's interconnected platform as well as all regions. The company's relentless focus on affording innovative products, boosting interconnected customer experience and driving productivity seems to be paying off. Additionally, housing market recovery remains a tailwind.
 The sturdy first half and expectations of improved home prices and re-emergence of first-time homebuyers, encouraged the company to raise fiscal 2017 view.

The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) and Lumber Liquidators Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LL) are both Services companies that recently hit new highs.

The company has grown sales at a 6.10% annual rate over the past five years, putting it in the medium growth category. HD has a net profit margin of 8.60% and is more profitable than the average company in the Home Improvement Stores industry. In terms of efficiency, HD has an asset turnover ratio of 2.18. This figure represents the amount of revenue a company generates per dollar of assets. HD’s financial leverage ratio is 11.93, which indicates that the company’s asset base is primarily funded by debt.

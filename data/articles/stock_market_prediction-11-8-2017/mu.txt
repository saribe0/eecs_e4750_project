 Mumbai: The University of Mumbai (MU) has brought out a special video to train professors and staffers in the On Screen Marking (OSM) system. It is also conducting training sessions for professors to prevent blunders in the 481 exams to be held for the second term. The OSM, introduced in the first term of this academic year, had caused major chaos.  The MU is focusing on training professors after major blunders in the OSM led to delays in announcing results for 477 exams conducted in the first term, inconveniencing 4.65 lakh students who appeared for them. It had to pass students by awarding average marks to all after answer sheets went missing. Students are still awaiting results of their re-evaluations, though the second-term exam time table has been announced.  The university has now brought out a master plan and has altered software to reduce glitches. Nearly four lakh students are scheduled to appear in these 481 exams, including 1,36,879 students for 227 exams from the Science and Technology stream. Close to 1,73,670 students are to appear for the 78 tests in the Commerce stream and 94,188 students for the Arts stream. The MU has already brought in major changes in the exam system, including refusing supplements to students in subsequent exams and steps to speed up scanning of answer sheets and the evaluation process. The number of scanning machines have been increased from 60 to 65, and the technical staff has also been increased from 200 to 250.

By Michael Wilmarth Nov. 7, 2017 Daymond John, CEO of FUBU and television personality from the reality series “Shark Tank,” gave a speech to a nearly-full Jesse Auditorium Nov. 1 as part of Delta Gamma Sorority’s Lectureship series.  Daymond John was the latest speaker in the Delta Gamma Foundation’s Lectures in Values and Ethics. Previous speakers include anthropologist Jane Goodall and CNN’s Lisa Ling.  The aim of DG’s lectureship series is to uphold MU’s values with every speaker, and John tailored his speech appropriately, citing respect, responsibility, discovery and excellence in his road to success.  MU students heard John’s success story, retrofitted with his five brand-conscious “shark points” and amplified by a soundtrack that began with old school hip-hop and ended with “For The Love of Money.” Hip-hop fit prominently into John’s personal narrative. Though he couldn’t sing, dance, or produce, John swore to himself that no matter what he would “live, die and prosper in the world of hip-hop.” John attributes every outcome of his life to his dedication to his “SHARK points,” or the acronym that John describes as his keys to success.  The points –— Set goals, Homework, Amor, Remember you are the brand and Keep on Swimming — are simple to remember but complicated in their application, John said. 
John credits amor, or “love,” with reorienting him when he started spending too much time partying and not enough with his family.  “Number one, I’m here to brag about my story and history,” John said. John’s story began in Queens, New York. The son of a single mother who worked three jobs, John credits his early financial struggle and perseverance with inspiring his entrepreneurial spirit that ultimately led to his success, which he called “the power of broke.” The bootstrapper rhetoric was well received by college students and fans. MU student Merna Jajou is a pre-med student, but felt that non-business majors could benefit from hearing John’s story as well. “He worked his way up; it wasn’t just given to him,” Jajou said. “Listening to someone that started from nothing and made something of himself is still really important.” John spoke quickly and smoothly, sometimes incorporating humor to shock and entertain the audience. At one point he implied his co-host, Kevin O’Leary, would “do drive-bys on orphanages.”  After praising the amount of time teachers spend with students, he remarked: “I don’t know how you do it. I spend two days with them and I want to slit my wrists and jump out the window.” John talked about the challenges he faced growing up in a tough neighborhood. A lack of role models made life in Queens difficult for kids like him. “We saw pimps and drug dealers,” John said. “We didn’t see heroes.” Race figured into John’s early struggles. He credits Joseph “Run” Simmons, from Run DMC, as his first role model. When John saw Simmons take the stage at a 1986 concert in Philadelphia, his life changed.  “I never saw anyone that looked like me, dressed like me, take the stage like that,” John said. Kayla Johnson recalled seeing something similar in John when she was growing up.  “It was cool to have a black voice on television,” she said. Johnson was inspired by John’s message that anyone could achieve success through hard work and adherence to morals. “There’s no magic that contributed to his success, it was just hard work,” Johnson said. “He’s just like you and me. If I put in the same amount of hard work, I can be successful too.” John credits neighborhood celebrity Russell Simmons, entrepreneur, producer and Queens native, for showing him he could be successful doing what he loved.  “He wasn’t a pimp or a drug dealer,” John said. John saw Simmons in magazines traveling the world by selling hip-hop. The inspiration to do what you love was passed on to MU student Cramon Mays. Mays was pleased with the entire lecture, and in particular with the encouragement he received to keep pursuing his dreams. “I keep telling myself that if I keep doing what I love, life will figure itself out,” Mays said. “It was comforting to hear that from somebody who has actually done it.” Edited by Sarah Hallam | shallam@themaneater.com Share: Facebook / Twitter / Google+ 0 comments This item does not have any approved comments yet.

			Galen Bacharier Nov. 7, 2017 MU announced a new initiative on Friday that will reduce rates for on-campus housing and expand dining plans for students starting in fall 2018. Chancellor Alexander Cartwright, Vice Chancellor Gary Ward, several Missouri elected officials and many Residential Life staff gathered in Rollins Commons for the announcement. The changes will result in a traditional community-style double room costing $6,430, a 2.2 percent lower rate compared to the current cost. This applies to 1,320 beds in rooms throughout Gillett, Hudson, Wolpers and Gateway Residence Halls, around 660 rooms. This new option costs $714 a month, almost $350 less for a year than the least expensive option this year. Four hundred sixty-four beds in Hatch Hall’s double rooms will have their rates lowered 5 percent, a $340 decrease, to provide for a more economic housing option. In all, more than one-third of available rooms will have lower-priced plans next fall. Dining plans will also be revamped. A new Mizzou Block 200 plan has been added, replacing the current Block 175 and 225 plans. This change came as a result of analysis of how much of their meal plans students were using. The Block 200 will run $3,100, about a $344 monthly cost. Another new dining plan, Tiger Plan Platinum, is a more flexible plan that works at all campus locations, including those in the Student Center. In addition, dining plans will no longer be required for returning students who will be living in residence halls. With these new lower-price economy plans, students will be able to live and dine on campus for less than $1,000 a month, according to the press release for the initiative. “We’re trying to make everything more affordable,” Cartwright said. “And if it’s better for the students and they find that this is a more affordable option, as well as beneficial, then a lot of them are going to take advantage of it.” This new initiative is expected to result in a 3.5 percent decrease in cost for the most commonly selected dining and housing plans, according to the press release. This change is one of a series of initiatives intended to make attending MU more affordable. Over the past year, MU has also announced a scholarship program for Missouri Pell Grant recipients and a move to more affordable textbook options. “These changes are very exciting as they will help to reduce the cost of a Mizzou degree,” Maggie Recca, Residence Halls Association president, said in the press release. Room and board is one of the largest costs for students who live on campus, normally totalling over $10,000 annually, according to the MU Student Financial Aid website. The university hopes to lessen that load. Cartwright stressed the importance of on-campus living during the announcement, referencing several residential life programs that benefit students, such as Freshman Interest Groups and Early Alert, a program that notifies staff of students in halls that are struggling academically or socially. “Coming from a small rural community, lower-middle class, I had to find ways — merit-based —  [to pay for school],” said Tim Davis, Missouri Students Association campus community relations chair. “I joined the National Guard to afford college. I’m looking forward to more continued efforts for this.” The option to live in residence halls year round is also included, in response to feedback from students. This will provide “convenient, hassle-free living,” according to the press release. “The level of support we provide in our residence halls makes a real difference when it comes to student success,” Cartwright said.

 WEBZEN today announced the worldwide opening of its acclaimed ARPG MU Legend. It marks the culmination of a one-year-long journey, punctuated by two closed beta tests and one stress test, since preparations began for the release of one of WEBZEN's most anticipated games.  Dennis Czybulka, COO at Webzen Dublin, acknowledged the occasion with these words: "Launching a game is always a high-stakes moment to live through, where hundreds of emotions collide. Here, in the 'OBT backstage', I am witnessing - let me put it like this - 'an exotic diversity of exhilarated states of mind ': The chills of enthusiasm are making hairs stand on end, adding a frenetic edge to the usual finger-tapping rhythm - still not missing a beat - and hearts are hammering faster than usual. Now, the fun starts for the fans, and our attention is focused entirely on making their game experience the most unforgettable yet. We're excited for players to experience first-hand the passion that we've put into MU Legend and look forward to seeing them all in-game." â The open beta is a "last preparation step", and players will retain all game data (characters, purchases, items, etc.) even after the day of the official release. Players no longer have to worry about any data wipes and can now take as much time as they need to explore the deep content offered by the game. Stating it clearly, there will be NO WIPE at all during or after the OBT period.  Although all game content has been made available today, further expansions are already in the pipeline. Developers are planning to deploy updates and extensions on a regular basis, with a 3v3-combat feature to arrive in the first update before the end of the year. This feature will offer a dynamic PvP environment, involving strategy and team coordination. Other new content, including territory wars, is slated to arrive soon after.  Additionally, thousands of players are due to receive their first special titles, awarded for participating in the CBTs and the stress test. The MU Legend team has announced that these marks of recognition will be delivered to those early pioneers on November 14th, 2017.  The team also offered a final comment: "It would have been almost impossible to carry the MU Legend dream this far - more than a decade after the launch of MU Online - without the support of the fans. We'd like to express our warmest thanks to all our players who've continued to have faith in this dream, and we hope that they'll enjoy the game as much as we've enjoyed developing it." Interested gamers can play MU Legend here or learn more about the game here.

Courtesy of Anastasia Shepherd Students in the Marshall INTO program's Service Learning Class recently conducted a fundraising bake-off. As part of the class, students divide into teams and compete to see which team can raise the most money for INTO Giving, a global nonprofit charity that focuses primarily on education. Courtesy of Anastasia Shepherd INTO faculty and staff volunteered at the Huntington Rails and Ales Festival in August to raise money for INTO Giving, a global nonprofit charity that focuses primarily on education. HUNTINGTON - INTO Marshall is a program that brings students from all around the world to Marshall University to study. But Marshall's international students don't just partake in academic pursuits. Some students also engage in a charity program called "INTO Giving" that helps children and educators in developing countries. Throughout the semester students have taken part in numerous fundraising activities. "INTO Giving is a global nonprofit charity that focuses primarily on education. A lot of that education is in the developing world, such as girl's education sub-Saharan Africa and education for Syrian refugees in Lebanon," Chris Walker, director of INTO Giving, said. "It has two centers, one in the UK and one in the U.S. In each of those countries there are about 10 universities where INTO employees and students all pile in to select the causes that they are going to support and turn around and raise money for it. One of the interesting things is that these are typically not a lot of people with a lot of wealth behind them. These are people who are giving about $5 here, $10 there, $20, etc. But collectively it raised around $75,000, and that kind of money goes miles when you are sending money to the developing world," Walker said. Anastasia Shepherd, chairperson for Marshall INTO Giving, explained students in the program's Service Learning Class were divided in two groups to engage in a bake-off competition to see which could raise the most money. The class also worked on a five-week project called "Money Tree," where each group conducted an event each week to see which could raise the most. "The students start with $20 at the beginning of the class and have five weeks to turn that into as much money as they can at the end," Shepherd said. One group had six students, while the other has five. "One is working towards a school in Thailand, and the other is working towards a school in Lebanon for refugees in Syria," Sihiam Elougli, fundraiser coordinator for Marshall INTO Giving, said. "As an ESL instructor I see the class as an educational tool for our students. It teaches our students the ideal of fundraising and all of the work that goes into that. From planning the events, to making things like fliers to advertise the events, and keeping track of their money." There have been other fundraisers in addition to the ones coordinated through the class. INTO faculty and staff volunteered at the Huntington Rails and Ales Festival in August to raise money for the cause. Students hosted an outdoor screening of the horror film "Wish Upon" on the lawn outside of the INTO center as an Oct. 17 fundraiser, and hosted the "Making Change Video Game Competition" on Nov. 1. There will be several more fundraiser activities throughout the month of November. "Henna for Hope" is set for 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. Wednesday, Nov. 8, at the Memorial Student Center, where folks can purchase henna tattoos for charity. A karaoke night is set for Thursday, Nov. 9, in room 215 of the INTO Center, during which students, faculty, staff and members of the community can take part in the fun for $2. The INTO Center also will host a carnival from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. Wednesday, Nov. 15. The event will include carnival-style games, including "whack-a-mole," as well as snacks.

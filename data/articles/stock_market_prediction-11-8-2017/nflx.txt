Source: Shutterstock Over the past few years, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has become an entertainment staple in many U.S. households. Combine the popularity of its online streaming service with the development of its own high quality, exclusive content, and it’s no wonder that NFLX stock has climbed more than 60% year-to-date and nearly 1,900% over the past five years. But, as great as this progress is, many Netflix stock investors are probably wondering: How long can it really last? In my previous article about NFLX stock, I related a Bernstein report on the declining use of traditional cable services by children to Netflix’s long-term popularity. I argued that although the findings did not directly relate to Netflix, they did apply to the general cordless mindset that continues to become the standard in the U.S. — a mindset that greatly benefits NFLX stock in the long-term. I still believe in the long-term success of the company; however, when you look at the bigger picture for Netflix stock, it’s also important to consider other elements outside the cordless movement itself. More specifically, can NFLX maintain its strength with a slew of new (and old) competition coming for its throne? For now, the company continues to impress shareholders. In fact, its latest earnings report cited “5.3 million new subscribers … its best net add in history” and “[t]he bulk of that, an impressive 4.5 million new subscribers, came from overseas.” But the impressive growth story can only continue for so long … right? The long-term picture for Netflix stock gets a little muddier when you consider the potential impact of future competition from the likes of Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB), Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), along with current — and growing — competition from Amazon.com, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Amazon Prime Video and Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) YouTube. Earlier this year, Disney reported that it will cease distributing its content via Netflix starting in 2018 and instead create its own streaming platform as well as a streaming service for ESPN. Of course, the absence of Disney alone is not enough to put an end to NFLX stock’s run, but its abandonment represents a dispersal of quality content. Beyond the enticement of existing/well-known films, there are only so many top-tier writers, actors and directors to grab for exclusive content and the more services there are to choose from, the less plentiful they may be on Netflix. In the years ahead, customers will have even more choices to make; and the inclination to choose multiple services, or at least choose Netflix as one of them, could decrease as the price for its services continues to rise. This, of course, assumes that competing services offer viable alternatives to what Netflix currently produces and plans to create in the years ahead. And NFLX stock isn’t going down without an epic, Hollywood-style fight. In the wake of Disney’s departure, the company plans to increase the already-Herculian output of its original films, with the company expecting to produce 80 NFLX-exculsive movies in 2018. The quality of these films is still to be determined, but the company is clearly continuing to grow its own content at an impressive rate. When you combine this new film-based content with the acclaim of its pre-existing “Originals” like Stranger Things, Orange Is the New Black and House of Cards, it’s highly likely that some of these films could draw in new subscribers while retaining the interest of old subscribers. But even the big-time successes of Netflix aren’t invulnerable to unexpected threats.

Nasdaq stocks continue to dominate the landscape. The latest round of earnings simply added gasoline to an already raging fire. But with the majority of the popular FANG stocks already skirting the stratosphere, it’s challenging to find low-risk entries. Unless you’re looking at Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), that is. Unlike its peers, NFLX stock yet remains close to its rising 20-day moving average. And while the rest of its pals have already busted through well-established resistance zones, NFLX hasn’t. But it’s getting darn close, and that’s what attracted me to it for today’s pick. Year-to-date, Netflix is already up 63% in what can only be described as a banner year for shareholders. At $201.50, it sits a mere pebble toss from record highs. The consolidation striking the stock over the past month has allowed the 20-day moving average to catch up, making it one of the least extended stocks of the coveted FANG gang. And that makes it a much easier stock to buy. Netflix shares have a long history of rewarding breakout buyers. More times than not, breaching resistance delivers swift follow through and big profits to buyers. Here’s to hoping such an outcome awaits for the upcoming breakout over $203. With earnings fading in the distance, implied volatility has receded to the lower end of its one-year range. And that means option premiums are cheap once more. To capitalize on the next breakout, consider buying the Jan $200/$215 bull call spread for $6.30. The max loss is limited to the initial debit and will be forfeited if NFLX sits below $200 at expiration. The max gain of $8.70 will be captured if Netflix shares can rise above $215 by expiration. By risking $6.30 to win $8.70, the option spread offers a potential return on investment of 138%. As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn’t hold positions in any of the aforementioned securities.

Latest evolution in the price of Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) stock has been one of the most talked about matter among the interested investors. Many analysts use price trends and patterns to predict future performance, and we can glean some important insights about NFLX by examining the chart. How has the stock performed recently? Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in the last month has increased +1.00%. Shares are now up over the past year, outperforming the broad market by -100% and outperformed a peer group of similar companies by 278%. After the latest session, which saw the stock close at a price of $200.01, NFLX sits below its 52-week high. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has been trading in a bullish manner, based on the relative positions of the stock’s 20 and 200 day moving averages. Momentum indicators 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that NFLX may be headed in the future. To forecast a stock’s future performance, analysts use momentum indicators, which take into account the size and speed of these price movements. As momentum begins to slow, it may be a sign that a recent trend is about to reverse. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for NFLX is 60.65%, which suggests that the stock is not particularly expensive or cheap, and not predisposed to a reactive price movement based on this measure. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 65.75%, tells a similar story, and suggests that NFLX currently trades in neutral territory. What do the trading volumes reveal? Analysts use volume trends to assess the level of conviction behind a stock’s price changes. When volumes suddenly increase above normal levels, it can be a sign that investors feel very strongly in one way or the other about the future direction of a stock, or may even have access to inside information. Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) average trading volume of 8,283,165 during the past month is 26.63% above its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been more active than usual in the stock in recent times. What do the analysts think? NFLX is currently undervalued by -6.7% relative to the average 1-year price target of $214.38 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 2.20, which implies that analysts are generally neutral in their outlook for NFLX over the next year. How risky is the stock?  In order to put NFLX’s recent price performance into context, we need to get a sense of how the stock moves in relation to the overall market. Beta, which measures a stock’s price volatility relative to the market, provides the cleanest measure of systematic risk for a stock. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has a beta of 1.40, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are more extreme than the market as a whole. NFLX therefore has a above average level of market risk. During the past couple of weeks, NFLX average daily volatility was 18.96%, which is 13.99 percentage points lower than the average volatility over the past 100 days.

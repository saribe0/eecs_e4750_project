 @FredericLambert Yesterday, Tesla confirmed the acquisition of Perbix, a factory automation company based in Minnesota. Today, we get a closer look at the newly acquired company as Tesla discloses that the owner can already unload Tesla shares from the acquisition.

(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Without disclosing the terms, Tesla confirmed that it bought the company with cash and shares. Today, Tesla had to file with the SEC that James S. Dudley, the owner of Perbix, can sell up to 34,772 Tesla shares acquired through the acquisition. It’s worth roughly $10.5 million at the last market close. Tesla wrote in the filing today: “The selling stockholder of Tesla, Inc. (“Tesla,” “we,” “us” or the “Company”) listed on page 5 may sell or otherwise dispose of up to 34,772 shares of our common stock pursuant to this prospectus. The selling stockholder acquired these shares from us pursuant to a share purchase agreement dated November 3, 2017 by and among the Company, PERBIX Machine Company, Inc., a Minnesota corporation, or PERBIX, JCD Investments, LLC, a Minnesota limited liability company and the sole shareholder of record of PERBIX, and James S. Dudley, as the sole member of JCD Investments, LLC, in connection with our acquisition of PERBIX.” Now, it doesn’t mean that it represents the entire deal to acquire the company, but it’s quite apparently part of it. Perbix’s website has been down since the acquisition was announced yesterday, but we get a good look at their operations through this corporate video (hat tip to Navin Nagrani): They seem to have a focus on mechanical and electrical engineering to develop machines and tools to help companies automate their manufacturing processes. The video explains that they have 2 main facilities in Minnesota: a manufacturing center and a design and engineering center. They are also operating a sales and technical support office in Puerto Rico.  They claim to have an “extensive array of machining, welding, and fabrication capabilities, including CNC milling stations,” at their manufacturing center. The company already has an existing customer base, which included Tesla, but if it’s anything like Tesla’s previous acquisition of a similar company, Grohmann Engineering, those customers are likely to be put aside as Perbix’s entire workforce, which consists of about 150 employees, will focus on tesla’s manufacturing operations. Electrek’s Take It looks that like Grohmann Engineering, Perbix’s team is going to be integrated into the Tesla Advanced Automation group that the automaker created last year to accelerate its automation effort. They added over 600 engineers and technicians in the group through the acquisition of Grohmann and they have been building the team ever since. Now the acquisition of Perbix will enable them to add a significant number of engineers to that team quickly. Tesla hasn’t really been active on the acquisition front until last year, but now this latest acquisition follows the acquisition of SolarCity, which itself had recently acquired 2 other companies, and Grohmann all within a year. A few year back, Tesla also acquired a tool and die company in Michigan, which was its first acquisition. Aside from SolarCity, the companies they acquired were fairly small, but the automaker also tried and failed to buy a lithium startup for $325 million back in 2014. Tesla is a transportation and energy company. It sells vehicles under its 'Tesla Motors' division and stationary battery pack for home, commercial and utility-scale projects under its 'Tesla Energy' division.

Under-promise and over-deliver. That is usually a recipe for success for companies on Wall Street. Management sets beatable expectations. The company then comes out and smashes those expectations. Analysts go, “Wow”. Estimates come up. Upgrades flood in. Investors buy in packs. The stock heads higher. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) seems to have flipped this script on its head in the hope that TSLA stock will follow. As opposed to under-promising and over-delivering, Elon Musk and co. consistently over-promise and under-deliver. And yet, it works for the company. Over the past year, TSLA stock is up 60% versus a 23% gain for the S&P 500. Why? Multiple reasons (it is a cult stock with an avid fan-base, Elon Musk is looked at by many as a visionary, and the company is attacking tomorrow’s biggest markets), none of which disappeared after the company’s botched third quarter earnings report. Some of them may have lost their luster, which is why the stock is trading below $300 for the first time since May. But with time, they will appear shiny again, and TSLA stock will bounce back. TSLA stock is perhaps the most polarizing stock on Wall Street. The bear thesis is pretty strong. It is a money-losing operation that keeps pushing off the prospect of sustained profitability. It is a car company that is trading at nearly 5-times sales (other major car companies trade well under 1-times sales). Competition is coming up in a big way. The whole industry might lose a massive tailwind if federal tax credits for electric vehicles in the US get slashed (look at what happened to EV sales in Georgia when that state cut its $5,000 EV tax credit in June 2015). Plus, Model 3 ramp is disappointingly slow. But the bull thesis is even stronger. Yes, it is a money-losing operation, but most hyper-growth stories are money-losing operations. At scale, TSLA could generate huge profits. TSLA stock does trade at a huge premium to other car companies, but sales at other car companies are (at best) inching up by a few percent a year. TSLA is expected to experience sales growth of 70% in each of the next two years.

 The top gainer with a security that increased in price during today’s trading was Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). Tesla, Inc. had a higher price at the close than it did at the open. The company holds a market cap of 49.4B with a P/E of *tba indicating whether its share price properly reflects its performance. Fundamentalists and value investors are seeing the low ratio of 4.59 as more positive – demonstrating that the company has a great deal of revenue with a fair price. However, technicians believes that a higher ratio would indicate the likelihood of a constant augmentation of the company’s share price. Tesla, Inc.’s P/B is valued at 9.8 exhibiting the investor sentiment on the value of the stock to its actual value. A higher P/B ratio of Tesla, Inc. is signposting that the investors have either overvalued it , or that its accountants have undervalued it. The P/B figure is also providing some ideas on whether the shareholders are paying too much for what would be left if the company went bankrupt immediately – but to consider that the company ought to have a lower P/B value. As of now, the increased share price of Tesla, Inc. makes it a lucrative buy for investors. A change of -0.38% in the price clearly indicates a strong asset performance for the corporation, , bearing in mind the total returns from its investment and dividends or distributions obtained from the investment. The ROA of Tesla, Inc. is currently valued at -3.30% indicating how profitable the company is in regards to its total assets. The figure tells us what earnings were generated from invested capital of Tesla, Inc.. It gives investors a clue on how effective the company is in converting the money it has to invest into net income. Tesla, Inc.’s ROI is valued at -5.80% relatively measuring the profitability on the investment. It evidently points out how profitable and preferable it is for the investors. The company has a current ratio of 1 gauging towards its ability in paying short-term and long-term obligations. With the existing current ratio, Tesla, Inc. is more than equipped to confront its liabilities with its assets. Tesla, Inc. has a quick ratio of 0.6 measuring its ability to meet its short term obligations with its most liquid assets. The high quick ratio specifies its better liquidity position on the credit terms the company has negotiated from its suppliers. The EPS growth this year is at 32.50% demonstrating an EPS growth of 69.60% in the coming year. This defines the most likely future of the stock price of Tesla, Inc.. With this high EPSGR it is predicted that growth rate will rise faster as compared to its competitors in the same industry. As it upholds an amended rate with more EPSGR it is prone to be a good target. Tesla, Inc.

https://qz.com/1117933/elon-musks-timeline-stays-true-to-form-as-tesla-tsla-posts-its-largest-quarterly-loss/

Tesla’s earnings numbers were not welcome news for investors. Today, the company said it delivered 26,137 cars during the third quarter, but only 222 of those were Model 3s. That’s far below the 1,500 Tesla was hoping to have delivered by this time. Overall, the company posted a loss of $619 million on sales of $2.98 billion. Tesla shares dropped by as much as 5.4% on the news in after-hours trading, before recovering slightly. Overall, the company’s stock is up by about 50% for the year. Tesla CEO Elon Musk had warned there would be bumps in the road as Tesla entered “production hell” for the Model 3, and in August warned of “production bottlenecks.” In a Nov. 1 letter to investors (pdf), Tesla clarified that the primary production constraint is the battery module assembly line in its Gigafactory 1 outside Reno, Nevada. Tesla said it was redesigning two parts of the battery assembly process, “key elements of which were done by manufacturing systems suppliers,” to streamline its automated manufacturing process. Musk says he’s camping out at the factory until the problems are resolved. In describing the struggle to get manufacturing back on track, he made an allusion to the nine circles of hell in Dante Alighieri’s Inferno. “We were in level nine, and we’re now in level eight and close to exiting level eight,” said Musk, “I thought we’d be more like level seven. I was really depressed three or four weeks ago.” Musk said that Tesla’s reliance on a small number of robotic stations to automate construction of the vehicle, rather than human workers, means that any problems on the line can slow assembly dramatically. The company’s fortunes are riding on the Model 3, which has a base price of $35,00. Tesla is betting its first mass-market car will elevate it to become the first automaker to join America’s famous “Big 3” in more than 50 years. Tesla has already surpassed all of them in market value at one time (GM put Tesla back in second place earlier this year), but the electric carmaker has yet to prove its staying power.  So far, it’s been a rough ride. Musk must coordinate a sprawling supply and production chain, including two factories where cars are assembled in Fremont and the Gigafactory where Model 3 battery packs and drive units are made. Tesla notes that its manufacturing process is more automated than most carmakers, and therefore takes longer to establish. The company said it plans to make 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week by about March 2018 (a quarter later than initially predicted) and then 10,000 units per week sometime after that. The company has about $3.5 billion in cash entering the fourth quarter to make it happen.

 @FredericLambert After market close today, Tesla released its financial results and shareholders letter for the third quarter 2017. Wall Street was expecting record revenue of about $2.9 billion for the quarter and a loss of about $2.45 per share due to large capital expenditure caused by the slow start of Model 3 production. The company released the official results today delivering on revenue of ~$2.9 billion and missed on earnings with a loss of $3.70 per share (GAAP).

(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Here we will be posting our follow-up posts about the earnings to expand on the most important points (refresh the page to see the most recent posts): The shareholder letter has been embedded in full below. Tesla’s stock price was down 4% in aftermarket trading following the release of the results. The results compare to revenue of ~$2.8 billion and a loss of $2.04 per share (GAAP) during the previous quarter. Tesla slightly updated its record delivery results for Model S and Model X: “In Q3, we delivered 25,915 Model S and Model X vehicles and 222 Model 3 vehicles, for a total of 26,137 deliveries. Combined Model S and Model X deliveries in Q3 grew 18% globally compared to Q2 and 4.5% versus the same quarter one year ago. Consequently, both Model S and Model X gained further market share in the US luxury vehicle market. In addition, our used vehicle sales more than doubled from the prior quarter.” The company’s gross margin took a big hit: 18.3% down from 27.9% quarter-over-quarter. It is attributed to Model 3 production being extremely costly right now with little deliveries. Investors will be happy to know that Tesla is not planning another capital raise despite its wider losses: “Between cash on hand, future cash flows and available lines of credit, we believe that we are well capitalized to accommodate the revised ramp of Model 3 production to 5,000 per week. Upon achieving this production level, we expect to generate significant cash flows from operating activities.” Here’s the shareholder letter in full:

Tesla earnings (Shutterstock photo) Tesla (TSLA), which has ambitions of being more mainstream, will report third quarter fiscal 2017 earnings results after Wednesday's closing bell. But investors would feel much better if the luxury electric vehicle company had ambitions of being more profitable. Tesla shares have taken a massive beating over the past couple of weeks, falling as much as 18% from its all-time high of $386.99 reached in June to a recent low of $316.66 — the stock’s lowest level since early August. A combination of factors has impacted TSLA stock. But the biggest concern rests with Tesla’s money-making capabilities, particularly as it relates its highly-anticipated Model 3 sedan — the company’s first attempt at producing a mass market electric vehicle. Tesla reportedly spends some $80,000 to build each Model 3, which will retail for $35,000 — or about half the price of Tesla's next-cheapest car, the Model S. The company believes the lower price point would enable it to emerge from a niche market to better compete with Detroit heavyweights General Motors (GM) and Ford (F). On Wednesday the Street will want to get a sense of not only how realistic Tesla’s Model 3 delivery goals are, but also how much cash it will take to meet those goals. Earlier this month the company spooked investors when announcing that its third-quarter Model 3 delivery totals would be 220 vehicles. Though that marked a 4.5% increase year over year, it’s below the 1,260 vehicles analysts expected and well below the company’s year-end production targets of 20,000 Model 3s a month by December. On Friday analysts at Evercore downgraded TSLA stock from Buy to Neutral, advising their clients to be “more cautious” on Model 3 production. The Model 3 is “the most important piece of the Tesla investment story in coming quarters,” Evercore warned. In terms of overcoming production hiccups, which CEO Elon Musk recently described at “manufacturing hell,” Evercore noted, “We suspect that Tesla won’t have 100% visibility on the ramp until they hit more than 1,000 Model 3 units per week.” As such, the firm reduced its price target on TSLA stock to $312, from $330, implying a 3% downside to Friday’s closing price of $320.87. In the three months that ended September, Wall Street expects the Palo Alto, Calif.-based company to post a per-share loss of $2.29 on revenue of $2.94 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when the company lost 71 cents per share on $2.3 billion in revenue. For the full year, ending in December, the loss is expected to be $6.67 per share, compared to a loss of $2.87 a year ago, while full-year revenue of $11.84 billion would rise 69.2% year over year. All told, with the 1,000 Model 3 units per week benchmark expected to be reached toward the end of November, Tesla has a lot to prove Wednesday if it wants to keep its shares from driving in reverse. From my vantage point, however, these shares, which I now own, are not as risky as they were three months ago. I’ve said this before, Tesla’s main problem — if you can call it that — is that the company must overcome too much demand for its products. And that’s a business I want a piece of.

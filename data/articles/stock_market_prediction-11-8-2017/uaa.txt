After previously competing in four games for the regular season, the UAA hockey team made their conference debut last weekend, Nov. 3-4. UAA traveled to Michigan for back-to-back games against Lake Superior State. Prior to the weekend duel, both teams had a total of five loses for the season, with Lake Superior State only leading the Seawolves by one win. However, Lake Superior got a head start with their Western Collegiate Hockey Association games, with one more than UAA. Post-games, both the Seawolves and Lake Superior sit near the bottom of the standings of WCHA standings at eighth and seventh, respectively. At the top of the standings is Bowling Green State University, with three conference wins and one conference loss. Right behind them is Minnesota State and Northern Michigan. The Seawolves got off to an exceptionally slow start on Friday. The first period resulted in no points made by either team. It wasn’t until the last 30 seconds of the second period that UAA took over. Junior forward Nicolas Erb-Ekholm used a power play to score the first UAA goal of the night and his second goal of the season. Erb-Ekholm’s goal wouldn’t have been possible if it weren’t for Nathan and Jonah Renouf assisting the play. The Seawolves maintained their lead for the majority of the second period until Lake Superior’s Anthony Nellis scored at nearly 17 minutes in the second period, bringing the game to a tie. Not long after, a power-play goal took Lake Superior into the lead, early in the third period. UAA’s freshman defenseman Cameron Trott scored late in the third period, with the power-play score tying it up for the rest of the third. Lake Superior’s Max Humitz scored at 3:38 in the first overtime to overtake the Seawolves, and win the game 3-2. UAA came back Saturday to seek redemption. After the Game 1 loss, the Seawolves made a comeback with a win of 4-1. The start of the game resulted in senior forward Tad Kozun being the first to score for the night, barely a minute into the game. His goal served as a rebound from the attempted shot by junior forward Cam Amantea. Tanner Johnson also assisted on the goal. Similar to the first period of the Friday night game, the second period of Saturday’s game stood at a stand still, without either team making a point. It wasn’t until just two minutes into the third period that the Seawolves came back strong. Senior forward Austin Azurdia managed to get his first goal of the night that put UAA up 2-0, assisted by defensemen Eric Sinclair and goaltender Olivier Mantha. For another four minutes, the Seawolves kept their defense up and maintained the 2-0 lead. Six minutes later, Lake Superior’s Jake Hand managed a power play that put the game a 2-1. Quickly after, junior forward Jeremiah Luedtke and Kozun initiated a set-up for Azurdia to successfully make his second goal of the night. The Seawolves regained their two point lead, and had less than 10 minutes in the game. Luedtke still managed to put in one more goal before the end of the night to close out the game win with just two minutes remaining. The win couldn’t have happened without the 34 saves accumulated by senior goaltender Mantha. With one win and one loss for the weekend, the Seawolves currently sit at a tie for eighth in the conference. UAA hockey will be back in action on Nov. 10 and 11 with away games against Alabama-Huntsville. The following weekend the Seawolves will return home to the Sullivan arena to host back-to-back home games versus Michigan Tech.

Is the worst over for Under Armour Inc (NASDAQ: UAA)? After seeing shares drop 29 percent post-earnings, expectations may now be so low that the company can now hit the reset button. The downside is now limited on Under Armour, but the company must protect their house better, Susquehanna analyst Sam Poser said in a Tuesday note. “The street is already bracing for poor results for the foreseeable future. Further, we believe UAA is becoming more cognizant of its recent mistakes,” Poser said. (See Poser's track record here.)  Susquehanna upgraded Under Armour from Negative to Neutral and raised its price target from $11 to $15. Under Armour is committed to returning to the pull model, with more demand and less inventory in the market, but Poser said he's not convinced that the retailer's distribution model will allow it to grow as an affordable luxury brand, given its current presence in discount retailers. “We believe that distribution to retailers such as Kohl’s, DSW and Famous Footwear must cease quickly in order to rebuild an affordable luxury brand with a pull model. Unfortunately, UAA appears focused on short-term growth over taking the painful but appropriate steps to make Under Armour a strong brand for the long-term,” Poser said.  Despite the upgrade, the Susquehanna analyst said Under Armour is in trouble in North America, and that the company must do an extraordinary amount of work to restore brand sentiment. Creating a compelling lifestyle business, albeit challenging in the current environment, will be an important factor in turning things around for Under Armour, Poser said.  Related Links:  Air Force 1: The Shoe That Defined Sneaker Culture Celebrates Its 35th Anniversary These Non-Tech Companies Are Investing In An AI Future   Photo courtesy of Under Armour.

Investors have been carefully witnessing the recent activity of Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE:UAA) stock. Analysts often use price and volume data to predict future stock performance. In the case of UAA, the chart has some interesting things to say about where the stock might be headed. How has the stock performed recently? Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE:UAA) in the last month has decreased -27.81%. Shares are now up over the past year, outperforming the broad market by -100% and outperformed a peer group of similar companies by 403%. After the latest session, which saw the stock close at a price of $12.02, UAA sits below its 52-week high. Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE:UAA) has been trading in a bearish manner, based on the relative positions of the stock’s 20 and 200 day moving averages. Momentum indicators 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that UAA may be headed in the future. Fortunately, there is way to use the speed and magnitude of these price changes to predict future performance, thanks to what are known as momentum indicators. As momentum slows, it might be a sign that a support or resistance level has been reached, and that a trend is about to reverse. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for UAA is 28.19%, which suggests that the stock may be primed for a trend reversal or a breakout to the upside. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 5.98%, tells a similar story, and suggests that UAA currently trades in oversold territory. What do the trading volumes reveal? In addition to price, analysts use volume trends to predict future performance. The level of trading activity in a stock is often a good proxy for the level of interest and enthusiasm for the name within the investment community. A sudden increase in activity can be a sign that investors are trading in anticipation of a catalyst. Under Armour, Inc. (UAA) average trading volume of 9,705,595 during the past month is 69.84% above its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been more active than usual in the stock in recent times. What do the analysts think? UAA is currently undervalued by -33.48% relative to the average 1-year price target of $18.07 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 3.10, which implies that analysts are generally neutral in their outlook for UAA over the next year. How risky is the stock?  In order to put UAA’s recent price performance into context, we need to get a sense of how the stock moves in relation to the overall market. Beta, which measures a stock’s price volatility relative to the market, provides the cleanest measure of systematic risk for a stock. Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE:UAA) has a beta of 0.05, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are less extreme than the market as a whole. UAA therefore has a below average level of market risk. During the past couple of weeks, UAA average daily volatility was 117.63%, which is -61.07 percentage points higher than the average volatility over the past 100 days.

https://www.adn.com/sports/uaa-athletics/2017/11/05/12th-ranked-duke-rips-uaa-but-cant-shut-down-kodiaks-wandersee/

 The nation's 12th-ranked Division I women's basketball team clobbered the nation's fourth-ranked Division II team Sunday, but the Duke Blue Devils couldn't stop UAA's Hannah Wandersee.  A 6-foot-1 junior from Kodiak, Wandersee had the best game of her college career in UAA's 87-56 exhibition loss at Cameron Indoor Stadium in Durham, North Carolina.  She put up the second double-double of her career — 19 point and 10 rebounds — and blocked four shots.  "We have been waiting for a breakout game from her like this," UAA coach Ryan McCarthy said in a press release from UAA. "(W)e just didn't realize it would come against Duke at Cameron Indoor Stadium."  Wandersee connected on 9 of 16 shots from the field and added two steals to lead the Seawolves, who got in trouble early.  Duke raced to a 10-0 lead, a burst that began with a wide-open 3-pointer by Lexie Brown, a two-time All-America guard. A 5-9 senior, Brown poured in 27 points on 10-of-17 shooting, with many of her points coming in transition.  Duke's speed and size proved fatal to the Seawolves, who surrendered 20 fast-break points and were outrebounded 48-34.  UAA responded to Duke's fast start with a 3-pointer by Shelby Cloninger and a jumper by Sydni Stallworth to make it 10-5, but the Blue Devils led 26-13 at the end of the first quarter and 49-28 at the half.  "This was a tremendous opportunity for us to test ourselves against incredible athletes at the highest level of our sport," McCarthy said. "I'm really proud of the effort our ladies showed today – they did not back down an inch. Hannah's effort was especially impressive."  Wandersee's only other double-double came in her freshman season when she posted 22 points and 11 rebounds against New Hope Christian, an Oregon school that belongs to the National Christian College Athletic Association.  Cloninger hit three of her six shots behind the arc to finish with 11 points for the Seawolves, who also got five points, four rebounds, four assists and two steals from Rodericka Ware.  Rebecca Greenwell, Brown's backcourt mate, dropped in 20 points to go with seven rebounds, six assists and five steals for the Blue Devils.  The Seawolves play their first games against Division II opponents this week at the Wildcat Crossover Tournament in Ellensburg, Washington. UAA faces Hawaii Pacific at 11 a.m. AST Friday and Cal State Los Angeles at noon AST Saturday.

https://www.chicagomaroon.com/article/2017/11/7/maroons-win-uaa-title/

The men’s soccer team snagged the UAA title with a 2–1 win against Wash U on Saturday. The victory was one for the books, as it marked the team’s annual senior day and gave the Maroons an automatic bid for the NCAA DIII tournament, their third in three years. The victory advanced the team’s overall record to 16–2. Game leaders included third-year forwards Matthew Koh with one goal and Max Lopez with one goal and one assist.  In response to the team’s performance on Saturday, second-year forward Dayo Adeosun said, “As a team, we are proud of the way we started off the game. We did well connecting the early vital passes needed for the team to get a flow.” Winning a UAA championship was an important goal for the Maroons this year, and securing the win on senior day made it that much better.  “Obviously, it is always a great feeling beating [our] conference rival Wash U,” said second-year defender Nate Johnson. “But what made it even more special was that we did it for our four seniors on Senior Day.” Although proud of the win, the Maroons are far from satisfied. Moving forward, they are looking to improve ball movement and vary their points of attack. After coming up short and losing in the third round of the National Tournament last year, the Maroons are looking to redeem themselves and bring home the gold.  “Moving into the postseason, it is always an exciting feeling,” Johnson added. “Last season we came up short, so there is definitely something that the three returning classes want to get back. We know we are a championship-caliber team, and we have a lot to prove both as a team and as a program.” Adeosun echoes his teammates sentiments, “At this point we are confident that if we continue to persistently focus in practice and understand that every moment matters, then we have a great chance to win it all. Ultimately, the national championship has been our goal since the beginning of the season, and we are determined to accomplish that.” The NCAA selection show is scheduled for 12:30 p.m. on November 6. The Maroons will find out where they are seeded and will likely play in the opening round on either November 10 or November 11.  “Following the excitement of the win over Wash U, we have a lot of motivation moving forward into the first round of the tournament this weekend,” Johnson said. “It is going to be exciting to find out our seed and prepare for our road to the Final Four.” The Maroons have an exciting week ahead of them with one goal in mind: winning a national championship.

Consistently, one of the more popular stocks people enter into their stock options watchlist at Stock Options Channel is Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (Symbol: WMT). So this week we highlight one interesting put contract, and one interesting call contract, from the November expiration for WMT. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting, is at the $87 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of 77 cents. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 0.9% return against the $87 commitment, or a 29.4% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost ).      Turning to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the November expiration, for shareholders of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (Symbol: WMT) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 2.3% annualized dividend yield. Selling the covered call at the $91 strike and collecting the premium based on the 85 cents bid, annualizes to an additional 31.6% rate of return against the current stock price (this is what we at Stock Options Channel refer to as the YieldBoost ), for a total of 33.9% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $91 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but WMT shares would have to advance 2.1% from current levels for that to happen, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 3% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.

 Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that WMT may be headed in the future. Fortunately, there is way to use the speed and magnitude of these price changes to predict future performance, thanks to what are known as momentum indicators. As momentum slows, it might be a sign that a support or resistance level has been reached, and that a trend is about to reverse. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for WMT is 71.05%, which suggests that the stock may be primed for a trend reversal or a corrective pullback in price. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 94.66%, tells a similar story, and suggests that WMT currently trades in overbought territory. What do the trading volumes reveal? Price isn’t the only tool analysts use to forecast future performance. Volume patterns can also reveal some important insights. If, for instance, a stock’s volumes suddenly increase by a significant amount, it’s usually a sign that the level of conviction behind the trade is high. Investors may feel very strongly about the future direction of the stock in question. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) average trading volume of 9,172,035 during the past month is 5.02% above its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been more active than usual in the stock in recent times. What do the analysts think? WMT is currently overvalued by 3.15% relative to the average 1-year price target of $86.94 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 2.40, which implies that analysts are generally neutral in their outlook for WMT over the next year. How risky is the stock?  When analyzing a stock’s price performance, it’s essential to take risk into account. Beta, which measures a stock’s volatility relative to the overall market, can be used to gauge the level of systematic risk associated with a particular stock. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has a beta of 0.34, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are less extreme than the market as a whole. WMT therefore has a below average level of market risk. During the past couple of weeks, WMT average daily volatility was 11.68%, which is 3.38 percentage points lower than the average volatility over the past 100 days.

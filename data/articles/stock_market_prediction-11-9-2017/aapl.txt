Source: Shutterstock Without fail, when someone dares to suggest Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is fallible and that AAPL stock has the potential to lose value, the fanboys come out in spades and “explain” to that person that they simply don’t appreciate the greatness of the company’s products and the profitability of the corporation. This time around isn’t apt to be any different. Nevertheless, simply because small things can end up being big things — and knowing companies are sometimes knocked off pedestals without any warning — a trio of problems with the recently unveiled and hotly touted iPhone X may in some way be a sign that Apple’s passion for perfection is a thing of the past. It’s a reality that should have smart investors at least wondering if AAPL stock has lost the luster it had when Steve Jobs was at the helm. Giving credit where it’s due, Apple’s newest smartphone is an amazing device, functionally and conceptually. The relatively small phone boasts a relatively large screen by using all the “real estate” available to it, the onboard camera is as powerful as any professional-caliber digital camera and the ability to charge the device wirelessly is a big hit. On the flipside, AAPL stock holders have already (or soon will) learn about a few too many flaws with the iPhone that simply wouldn’t have been allowed to exist at a different time for the company. Three of them are conspicuous enough imply Apple is losing its touch when it comes to the quality that its loyal fans fell in love over the course of the past decade. Users of the newest iPhone will likely have noticed the screen is sharper and more vibrant than smartphone screens they’ve seen in the past. There’s a reason. Apple is using an OLED (organic light emitting diodes) screen, which is amazing to be sure, but will eventually result in burn in, or the permanent “ghosting” of a displayed image on the physical screen, even when that image isn’t being displayed on-screen. It’s not Apple’s fault, to be fair. Burn-in is a reality for all OLED screens. But since Apple made a choice to use OLED technology though — and arguably didn’t have to — it’s going to be held accountable by frustrated customers.

https://stocknews.com/news/aapl-report-apple-inc-aapl-bringing-facial-recognition-to-ipad/

AAPL – Apple’s next generation of high-end iPads will feature facial recognition technology. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is reportedly porting a key piece of iPhone X technology over to its highest-end iPads. That’s according to Bloomberg sources, who indicated this week that upcoming iPads could feature slimmer edges and facial recognition: However, the new version of the tablet is unlikely to include an OLED screen, which provides more vivid colors and sharper clarity, the people said. They asked not to be identified talking about private product development. At least one new iPad model with a screen size similar to the 10.5-inch iPad Pro is planned to include Face ID for unlocking the device, making payments, and sending animated emojis. The feature would replace the iPad home button that has come with a fingerprint scanner since 2014, one of the people said. The updated tablet is expected to be released later next year, a little more than a year after the last major iPad Pro upgrade, the people said. Similar to the iPhone X, the new iPads could have edge-to-edge glass due to the lack of home button. It would be the first major revamp of the iPad’s design since iPad Pro hit the shelves in 2015. Apple is no doubt hoping the changes will reignite iPad sales, which have lagged in recent years amid a glut of tablets from competitors in the marketplace. Apple Inc. shares rose $0.14 (+0.08%) in premarket trading Thursday. Year-to-date, AAPL has gained 54.06%, versus a 17.57% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period. AAPL currently has a StockNews.com POWR Rating of A (Strong Buy), and is ranked #1 of 28 stocks in the Technology – Hardware category.

How much will cost to replace a damaged iPhone X? The short answer: up to more than half the cost of buying a new device, according to Statista.  Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL)'s iPhone X starts at $999 for a base model 64GB device and moves up in price for higher storage. This makes the iPhone X the most expensive iPhone to date, yet it appears that demand for the phone outpaces supply. Apple began accepting pre-orders for the iPhone X last week and it sold out within minutes. The estimated delivery time now stands at five to six weeks. The lucky few who will have an iPhone X in their hands in a few weeks' time are naturally cautioned not to drop or break the phone, because it will be pricey. Apple's official screen repair service for the iPhone X will cost consumers $279, and damage beyond the screen will set consumers back $549, Statista said. By comparison, a screen repair for the iPhone 8 Plus costs $169, and $399 if damage extends beyond the screen. The cheapest screen to repair is the iPhone SE at $129, or $269 for extensive damage.

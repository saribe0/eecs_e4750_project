Recent price movements in the stock of Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) have caught the attention of the investment community. It is widely believed that a stock’s future performance can best be predicted by analyzing prior trends and patterns in price. In the case of AMAT, the chart has some interesting things to say about where the stock might be headed in the future. How has the stock performed recently? Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) in the last month has increased +7.92%. Shares are now up over the past year, outperforming the broad market by -100% and outperformed a peer group of similar companies by 153%. After the latest session, which saw the stock close at a price of $56.55, AMAT sits below its 52-week high. Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) has been trading in a bullish manner, based on the relative positions of the stock’s 20 and 200 day moving averages. Momentum indicators 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that AMAT may be headed in the future. Fortunately, there is way to use the speed and magnitude of these price changes to predict future performance, thanks to what are known as momentum indicators. As momentum slows, it might be a sign that a support or resistance level has been reached, and that a trend is about to reverse. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for AMAT is 67.77%, which suggests that the stock is not particularly expensive or cheap, and not predisposed to a reactive price movement based on this measure. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 81.17%, tells a different story, and suggests that AMAT currently trades in overbought territory. What do the trading volumes reveal? Volume patterns can also be useful for predicting future performance. When trading activity is abnormally high, it’s often a sign that the market feels particularly strong in one way or another about the future direction of a stock. Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT) average trading volume of 9,224,880 during the past month is 6.49% below its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been less active than usual in the stock in recent times. What do the analysts think? AMAT is currently undervalued by -5.59% relative to the average 1-year price target of $59.90 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 1.80, which implies that analysts are generally bullish in their outlook for AMAT over the next year. How risky is the stock?  When analyzing a stock’s price performance, it’s essential to take risk into account. Beta, which measures a stock’s volatility relative to the overall market, can be used to gauge the level of systematic risk associated with a particular stock. Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) has a beta of 1.84, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are more extreme than the market as a whole. AMAT therefore has a above average level of market risk. During the past couple of weeks, AMAT average daily volatility was 16.02%, which is 11.48 percentage points lower than the average volatility over the past 100 days.

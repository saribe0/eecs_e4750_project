Shares of Jeff Bezos led Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) have lost momentum ahead of its third-quarter earnings which the company is scheduled to report today after the market close. Amazon stock has been almost in a downtrend since the beginning of last week in spite of having many reasons to climb higher. On top of it, AMZN stock is yet to recover from its post-earnings sell-off in July end. Hence, a lot is riding on the Seattle, Washington based company's Q3 earnings to drive the recovery in Amazon stock and for it resume its uptrend. Investor sentiment is little shaky ahead of earnings on account of the big EPS miss in the last quarter earnings. Coming to Street estimates, analysts expect the eCommerce giant to report a top line of $42.14 billion, which would translate into a good 28.8% YoY revenue growth. While the revenue growth has never been a problem for Amazon, it's the EPS which disappointed investors in the second quarter earnings as the company missed the Street estimate by a massive margin. For the latest quarter, the Street's consensus estimate for EPS is a non-GAAP earnings of 3 cents per share, a drastic drop from the year-ago quarter EPS of  52 cents, implying a 94% YoY decline. There's little doubt in concluding that Amazon stock could see another correction if the company misses on the EPS target again. Though the current earnings whisper for Amazon which is a non-GAAP earnings of 8 cents per share does suggest that it could deliver an earnings beat. Apart from all this, the third quarter earnings would have a special focus on the impact of Whole Foods' acquisition on the online retail giant's financials. Further, the operating income and Q4 guidance are other crucial metrics which could have a big impact on AMZN stock's fortunes. For a detailed preview of the AMZN stock's Q3 earnings and more insights about how to play Amazon stock ahead of earnings, please go through our Amazon earnings preview. The so called 'boring' Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock has outperformed the broader markets with year-to-date returns of nearly 27%. Under the leadership of Satya Nadella, Microsoft has charted new all-time highs and is also presently trading near its all-time highs. MSFT stock has seen a steady rally over the last one month going into earnings, gaining more than 7%. Now, the expectations are really high from the Redmond, Washington-based tech company's Q1 earnings, which it is set to report today after the closing bell. In spite of the recent highs, there are expectations from Q1 earnings to propel the Microsoft stock much higher. Moving on to analyst estimates, Wall Street expects the company to report earnings per share of 72 cents on a revenue of $23.56 billion. The analyst estimates translate to a 5.5% YoY growth in revenue whereas earnings see a decline of 4 cents from the year-ago quarter EPS of 76 cents per share. The recent earnings history has been very good and the earnings whisper for MSFT stock of 76 cents also suggests that the company would deliver a beat and match the last year earnings number. Microsoft stock has run up quite a bit ahead of earnings by its own standards. However, that also elevates the risk in the context of today's earnings announcement. Either way, Microsoft's earnings release promises to be an interesting event today. For those interested, here's a detailed look at what to expect from Microsoft earnings today. The third earnings for the day is of Brian Krzanich led Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), also scheduled after the market close. Shares of the Mountain View, California based semiconductor giant have seen a strong bullish rally after the last quarter earnings and Intel stock is up by nearly 18% over the last three months. This has been very unlike INTC stock from the first half of 2017 when it was largely subdued. The question now is, whether the latest Q3 earnings will set the Intel stock on a new rally or not? First, we shall have a look at the Street estimates. The average analyst EPS estimate for the Chipzilla in Q3 is 80 cents per share same as the last year same quarter EPS number. The chipmaker is expected to deliver a revenue of $15.73 billion which translates to a marginal YoY decline of 0.3%. One of the archrivals of the semiconductor giant, AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) the other day posted strong top line and bottom line numbers. It's been widely discussed AMD is closing down on Intel in the CPU market and mounting a stiff challenge in its near monopoly server market. Now, the onus is on the Chipzilla, to prove that it can fend off the challenge from its much smaller rivals Dr. Lisa Su led AMD. The performance of the CPU and server segment will be closely watched as those are the segments where AMD seems to be gaining traction at the cost of Intel. As we had noted in our recent detailed Intel Q3 earnings preview, while one can expect Intel to deliver another earnings beat, but the chances of any steep gains in Intel stock immediately following the earnings look grim. The earnings whisper number, which is believed to be Street's unofficial view, suggests an EPS of 82 cents, implying a 2 cents earnings beat. Looking for fundamentally strong tech stocks like Apple?

Asian shares wrung out another decade peak on Wednesday as data showed China’s demand for imports remained buoyant, while the dollar dipped amid concerns Republican plans for major U.S. tax cuts were running into headwinds. Beijing reported imports in October rose 17.2 percent from a year earlier, beating forecasts of 16 percent, but export growth was just under estimates at 6.9 percent. China’s blue-chip CSI300 index .CSI300 gained 0.6 percent to reach ground last trod in mid-2015, just one of many milestones across region. Hong Kong stocks .HSI made a decade top, powered by investor enthusiasm for tech stocks as shares in China Literature Ltd doubled in their red-hot debut (0772.HK). Likewise, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS erased early losses to raise 0.2 percent, it’s highest since November 2007. Japan’s Nikkei .N225 fell 0.2 percent, though that followed its best close since 1992, and Australia’s main index notched its loftiest reading since 2008. Wall Street had taken a breather on Tuesday after again making record peaks. The Dow .DJI ended up 0.04 percent, while the S&P 500 .SPX lost 0.02 percent and the Nasdaq .IXIC 0.27 percent. The S&P 500 financial index .SPSY led decliners with a 1.33 percent fall, in part on concerns a flattening yield curve would crimp profits at banks that borrow short to lend long. The U.S. yield curve has flattened sharply in the last couple of weeks, with the gap between two- and 10-year yields shrinking to just 68 basis points, the smallest since 2007. The move largely reflects wagers the Fed is determined to hike in December, pushing up short-term yields. Such a move was likely to ensure inflation stays lower for longer, thus pulling down longer-dated yields and flattening the curve. (Source: Reuters) Top Pick for Wednesday: Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) has grabbed attention from the analysts when it experienced a change of 0.22% in the last trading session to close at $1123.17. On Wednesday Amazon declared that Alexa and Echo are now available by invitation in Japan. In Addition To, developers can now use the Alexa Skills Kit to create Japanese Alexa experiences, and will soon be able to use the Alexa Voice Service to integrate Alexa into products for Japanese customers. “Tens of millions of customers already love Alexa and we’re thrilled to introduce her to our customers in Japan recently, with an all-new experience designed from the ground up for Japanese customers, counting a new Japanese voice, local knowledge, and over 250 skills from Japanese developers,” said Tom Taylor, Senior Vice President, Amazon Alexa. “We’re also excited to expand the Alexa Skills Kit and the Alexa Voice Service, so developers and hardware makers around the world can create Alexa experiences for our Japanese customers.” A total of 2,665,011 shares exchanged hands during the intra-day trade contrast with its average trading volume of 3.39M shares, while its relative volume stands at 0.79. Relative volume is the comparison of current volume to average volume for the same time of day, and it’s displayed as a ratio. If RVOL is less than 1 it is not In Play on this trading day and Investors may decide not to trade it.  If RVOL is above 2 it is In Play and this is more evidence Investors ought to be in the name.  When stocks are *very* In Play one can see a RVOL of 5 and above.  The higher the RVOL the more In Play the stock is. Day traders strive to make money by exploiting minute price movements in individual assets (usually stocks, though currencies, futures, and options are traded as well), usually leveraging large amounts of capital to do so, therefore they trade on Stocks in Play. In Play Stocks are volatile enough to produce good risk and reward trading opportunities for both bull and bear traders intraday. Most company stocks have very little volatility. They generally move extremely slowly and they only produce big price swings when the company produces good or bad trading results, which may only happen a couple of times a year at best. In deciding what to focus on – in a stock, say – a typical day trader looks for three things: liquidity, volatility and trading volume. Liquidity allows an investor to enter and exit a stock at a good price (i.e. tight spreads, or the difference between the bid and ask price of a stock, and low slippage, or the difference between the predictable price of a trade and the actual price). If a stock does not have good liquidity then it may take some time before a broker is able to negotiate a deal to buy or sell a stock and the broker may not be able to get the sell or buy price that the trader is looking for. This is a problem for day traders and it could mean the difference between a profitable and non-profitable trade. Traders have different rules for what constitutes liquidity and a good guide is the volume of trades and volume of shares that are traded each day. 100,000 shares traded per day would be a minimum for most traders and some require 1,000,000. Trading volume is a gauge of how many times a stock is bought and sold in a given time period (most commonly, within a day of trading, known as the average daily trading volume – ADTV). A high degree of volume indicates a lot of interest in a stock. Often, a boost in the volume of a stock is a harbinger of a price jump, either up or down. Volatility is simply a measure of the predictable daily price range—the range in which a day trader operates. More volatility means greater profit or loss. After a recent check, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock is found to be 1.48% volatile for the week, while 1.67% volatility is recorded for the month. Technical’s Snapshot: The stock has a market cap of $532.76B and the number of outstanding shares has been calculated 474.34M. Based on a recent bid, its distance from 20 days simple moving average is 9.03%, and its distance from 50 days simple moving average is 13.05% while it has a distance of 18.88% from the 200 days simple moving average. The company’s distance from 52-week high price is -0.20% and the current price is 58.17% away from 52-week low price. The company has Relative Strength Index (RSI 14) of 75.97 together with Average True Range (ATR 14) of 20.68. Stock’s Valuation: Past 5 years growth of AMZN observed at 29.00%, and for the next five years the analysts that follow this company is expecting its growth at 58.00%. The stock’s price to sales ratio for trailing twelve months is 3.31 and price to book ratio for the most recent quarter is 21.91, whereas price to cash per share for the most recent quarter are 21.92. Its quick ratio for the most recent quarter is 0.70. Analysts mean recommendation for the stock is 1.80. This number is based on a 1 to 5 scale where 1 indicates a Strong Buy recommendation while 5 represents a Strong Sell.

But it is unlikely in the first place Amazon will try to take over Thermo Fisher's market, as this has been an ongoing on-and-off rumor for the past six years.In fact, it would be challenging for Amazon to try and take over the channel for four reasons, including:Lab supplies is a very small market at $15 billion as opposed to a $300 to $400 billion PBM market Amazon may find more lucrative.TMO's stickiness would be very hard for anyone to break.Low-value purchase orders are streamlined to Thermo Fisher in a way that Amazon may not be able to replicate.Thermo Fisher deals with complex products that require large sales and support teams.Finally, it is difficult to imagine a scenario where Amazon supplies restriction enzymes, proteases, QPCRs, sequencing supplies, Nanodrops and LC-MS products."We believe AMZN is fully capable of supplying orders of IT hardware and has taken share from CDW-G (the government/academic IT hardware provider) among universities and government accounts, but same can not be said for Fisher's catalog (Catalog LINK) just yet", the firm's analyst commented.

AMZN – After hitting new all-time highs yesterday, technical analysis shows more gains ahead for Amazon. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is highly likely to continue its massive bullish run over the next several weeks, according to one prominent technical analyst. TradingAnalysis.com founder Todd Gordon explained to CNBC why Amazon’s chart is so bullish right now: “You can see that [Amazon has made a very nice uptrend in 2017],” the technical analyst said Tuesday on CNBC’s “Trading Nation.” “And if we were to draw a parallel channel, you can see that [Amazon] is moving towards the top end of the parallel channel just south of $1,200 … It looks like we have room towards $1,160 to $1,180 here in the next one to two months” That’s another rally of as much as 5 percent for the stock, which is already up 50 percent this year. Gordon also points out a “cup and handle” technical formation in Amazon’s chart, which is another bullish signal for traders. The analyst is playing the stock via an options spread strategy by buying the “December 8 weekly 1,135-strike call and pair[ing] that with the sale of the December 8 weekly 1,140-strike call for about $2.10.” This tactic will pay off handsomely if AMZN closes above $1,140 on the December 8 expiration. Amazon.com, Inc. shares fell $1.97 (-0.18%) in premarket trading Wednesday. Year-to-date, AMZN has gained 49.78%, versus a 17.37% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period. AMZN currently has a StockNews.com POWR Rating of C (Neutral), and is ranked #22 of 50 stocks in the Internet category.

Amazon has never particularly cared about hitting short-term earnings expectations. But when it does, investors go crazy. Shares of Amazon surged 8% in after-hours trading today (Oct. 26) after the company beat third-quarter expectations. Amazon reported $256 million in profit, roughly comparable to net income in the same quarter a year earlier. It generated $43.7 billion in sales, up 34% year over year and comfortably above the $42 billion in revenue that analysts were expecting. The results mean that Amazon’s sales growth has now accelerated for four straight quarters, a good sign for the company as sales growth in its crucial Amazon Web Services unit has stagnated. AWS, Amazon’s cloud services business and a reliable revenue-generator, contributed $4.6 billion in revenue in the most recent quarter, up 42% from the third quarter of 2017. That’s about the same rate that AWS grew at in the second quarter of this year, and slower than any other quarter in recent years. The main event of Amazon’s third quarter was, of course, the $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods that it completed in August. Amazon said Whole Foods contributed $1.3 billion in sales this past quarter, which ended Sept. 30. Whole Foods reported $3.7 billion in sales in its quarter ended July 2, its last one as an independent public company.

Amazon earnings (Shutterstock photo) Retail giant Amazon (AMZN) is set to report third quarter fiscal 2017 earnings results after the closing bell Thursday. In the three months that ended September, the Seattle-based company is expected to earn 3 cents per share on revenue of $42.05 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when the company earned 52 cents per share on $32.71 billion in revenue. For the full year, ending December, EPS is expected to be $3.63 per share, down from $4.90 per share a year ago, while full year revenue of $174.65 billion would rise 28.4% year over year. Clearly, the e-commerce giant is still projected to put up impressive growth numbers. Notably, this is even though Amazon — now valued at close to $500 billion — is almost twice the size of Wal-Mart (WMT). That said, the company did miss its second quarter earnings estimates and signaled increased capital spending, which spooked investors into selling AMZN stock. The shares took a massive haircut as a result, falling from its all-time high of $1,083 to around $936. While the shares have rebounded somewhat, the stock is still down 7% in three months, suggesting investors are anxious whether CEO Jeff Bezos — as he’s known to do — will decide if it’s time to mash the profit accelerator or continue to building out his vision, which ultimately means higher spending. As such, on Thursday, analysts will also focus on the company’s profit margins, looking for any hint into Bezos’ thinking and whether the stock deserves its consensus price target of $1163, which calls for 20% rise from current levels. Amazon continues to invest in ways to strengthen its logistics, while also expanding internationally. The company’s plans for Whole Foods acquisition will also be a hot topic. Amazon, which immediately cut prices of some selected grocery products, has wasted no time dictating food prices. The acquisition is a way for Amazon to broaden its Prime shopper base. How much of a contribution has Whole Foods made? Piper Jaffray analysts are modeling for $1.4 billion. Beyond the top and bottom line numbers and the impact of Whole Foods, the Street will want to see how the company’s AWS (Amazon Web Services) cloud platform performs, which will dictate how much of a focus should be placed on the company’s capital spending. AWS boats more than half of Fortune 500 companies on the platform to run their businesses. It’s still the clear-cut leader in cloud market share and accounts for more than half of Amazon's operating profits in 2016, up ten percentage points than 2015. At the same time, however, competing cloud platforms from Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) are gaining traction. In the second quarter, AWS revenue rose 42% year over year to $4.1 billion, showing that it is still growing impressively. To the extent AWS, which grew 55% in the year-ago quarter, can grow at 40%-plus Thursday the Street will be pleased. This is because despite the growth deceleration, AWS is still growing twice as faster the retail segment, while producing operating margins that are ten times higher. In other words, AWS carries tons of muscle. And if Amazon can flex more of it Thursday the stock should fly towards all-time highs, and in the process assuaging investor fears about any increased sending the company may wish to adopt to maintain its competitive edge.

Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) posted its third-quarter results Thursday afternoon. The company reported its earnings after the market closed, which saw AMZN shares soar on the e-commerce retailer’s impressive results. Earnings came in at 52 cents per share, which was in line with the year-ago mark. Revenue was a strong point for Amazon, coming in at $43.7 billion, ahead of the $42.19 billion that analysts were calling for, and ahead of the year-ago mark by 34%. One of the most important elements of the period was the acquisition of Whole Foods, which saw the retailer take over a segment of the grocery industry. Prime Day was important for the company as it helped retail growth to increase, especially in international markets, according to the company’s CFO. Amazon Web Services is the strongest segment of the retailer, growing 42% year-over-year and amounting to 11% of the company’s total revenue. The cloud computing unit is also growing at a fast rate for the retailer, surging to $4.6 billion in the period, ahead of the $3.2 billion from a year ago. Amazon predicts that it will rake in between $56 billion and $60.5 billion in sales during its fourth quarter, which marks a growth of between 28% and 38% for the period. The forecast is fueled by the Whole Foods acquisition, as well as a favorable foreign exchange rate. Operating income is slated to be between $300 million and $1.65 billion, compared with $1.3 billion in the year-ago quarter. AMZN shares soared 7.6% after the bell.

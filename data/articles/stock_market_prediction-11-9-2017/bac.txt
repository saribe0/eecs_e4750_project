Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) reported pretty strong quarterly results in October. Despite a slowdown in investment banking, BofA still beat earnings expectations. It didn’t do much for BAC stock though. The company missed on revenues, and when you look further at the situation, you see more and more weaknesses in BAC’s story. Management has done a great job reviving the company. But when BAC stock is up 60% over the past year, you need more than that. I fear this is as good as it gets, and BAC stock will sell off soon. BAC stock has come a long way since early 2016. In less than two years, BAC stock has rallied from a low of $12 to $27. That’s a 125% gain. Over the same stretch, its major rivals all rallied, but to a significantly lesser degree. Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS) is up 54%, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) rose 70%, Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C) rallied 81%, Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE:WFC) is up just 14%. The sector ETF, Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLF) gained 26%. This reflects investor sentiment more than anything. If you look at the gains, the banks previously viewed as safest, such as Wells Fargo, massively underperformed. Meanwhile, the banks that fared the worst during the financial crisis, such as Citigroup and Bank of America flew up the fastest. This came not from superior operating performance, but instead from investors finally abandoning the financial crisis mentality and looking at former dogs like BAC and Citigroup with a fresh set of eyes. In November 2017, however, there is no stigma left on former worst of breed banks like BofA. Of its immediate peer group, BofA (15.8x) actually has the highest PE ratio at the moment. Goldman Sachs, a clearly superior bank, is at just 12x earnings, and well-managed JP Morgan is at 14x. It’s hard to justify this on operating performance either. On key metrics such as Return on Equity “ROE” and profit margin, BAC tends to rank in the middle of the pack or lower. One point in Bank of America’s favor, their price/book ratio is still lower than their peers. But bears would argue that is justified given that there is little evidence that BofA has better assets than its peers. To justify a higher PE ratio than its peers, Bank of America would need something that makes it stand out. However, it’s unclear what BofA’s distinctive edge is. Are they the country’s leading investment bank? No, that’s Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan. BofA is a strong third, but third doesn’t merit first-place valuation. Are they the largest bank overall in the U.S. by total assets? No, Bank of America is number two there, again trailing JP Morgan. Wells Fargo still dominates U.S. mortgages. Again, Bank of America has a strong position, but not the leading one. Bank of America’s post-financial crisis strategy has been to focus on higher-quality customers. Their average FICO scores on new loans are substantially above the median. Unfortunately, that appears to be the new norm for most of the large U.S. banks. Non-traditional lenders are picking up more of the slack with lower credit score borrowers as the huge national banks all try to avoid repeating the errors of 2008. Other BofA bulls point to restructuring, digital efforts, and so on, but then again, what large U.S. banks aren’t making these moves too?

 Before September, translation didn’t matter — at least, from an infosec standpoint. Taking content written in one language and changing it to another wasn’t at the top of most CSOs’ lists of data risks. Then Norwegian news network NRK uncovered a breach at Statoil, one of the world’s biggest oil and gas companies. NRK reports that the $46 billion business used Translate.com, a free online tool, to translate “notices of dismissal, plans of workforce reductions and outsourcing, passwords, code information, and contracts.” Then, the story continued, Lise Lyngsnes Randeberg, a college professor, Googled Statoil: In her results were the company’s translations. [ Learn why Target's data breach settlement sets a low bar for industry security standards. | Get the latest from CSO by signing up for our newsletters. ] “Wow! What is this?” Randeberg thought, telling NRK, “This was information from organizations, private companies, government agencies.” In other words, stuff Statoil may not have wanted Randeberg — or any Google user — to read. The translation industry saw the breach coming. “It was something that we had been warning companies about [for] 10 years or so,” says Don DePalma, Chief Strategist at Cambridge-based think tank Common Sense Advisory.  “It's been a question that's been coming up, given the way [free online translation] works: Is that something that would expose information?” So how did it happen? Only Translate.com knows for certain. Neither they nor Chicago-based parent company Emerge Media responded to CSO’s requests for comment. In general, here’s how free online translation works: Every word you enter is stored in a translation engine where machine learning uses your entry — and its translation — to improve future results. That means anyone who uses the tool after you either has use of or access to your data, if not both. Whether your information winds up on Google from there depends on where and how the tool provider stores it. When it comes to preventing your own translation-related data breach, the first step is to determine when employees can — and can’t — use free tools. At BASF, that answer is never. After learning employees were translating “important emails about new products, business plans, [and] PowerPoint presentations” online, independent technology consultant Kirti Vashee says the company blocked all free translation sites. For an option that’s less severe, you can always limit the use of free translation tools by topic. Maybe it’s okay to enter product shipment details in the software, but not receiver contracts. Vashee says this is problematic, though: Employees often use free translation to see what something’s about. “People will use Google [Translate] and Bing [Translator] because they get a memo in Chinese and just want to know, ‘What is he talking about?’” Employees who don’t speak a language might not realize content is about a sensitive topic until they’ve already translated it. A more secure option is to create your own machine learning engines and move translation in-house. That’s what Volkswagen did, Vashee explains: “They specifically don’t want to use outside engines because of the risk of exposure.” Of course, in 2016 Volkswagen’s revenue was $251.6 billion. That’s more than the GDP of many sovereign nations, including Chile and Finland. At a company that large, internalizing translation is easy. For other businesses, it’s simply not realistic. So what can those companies do? Instead of plugging data in random tools online, tell employees to route all translation through a professional provider. Translation vendor selection is usually based on quality, turnaround and cost. To ensure data security, ask prospective resources how they receive and deliver files for translation. If they say email, watch out. “[Email is] 10 times riskier than any [online] solution because it’s very easy to break into people’s email,” Vashee says. Email is also readily forwarded — something many translation companies depend on. A human translator gets the job by specializing in that content type and the language direction needed — English into Polish, for example. If either of those factors change, so does the translator. As a result, even the largest translation companies don’t have in-house resources for everything you need. DePalma says, “There's a lot of reselling in the industry,” translation companies outsourcing work to other providers. “Let's say somebody comes along and wants Albanian to Polish,” he explains, “There's a very small demand for that and they’re probably not going to provision for that on a 24/7/365 basis.” So after you email your file to your selected translation company, they forward it to another one, likely a business you’ve never heard of that only offers Polish. But your data won’t stay there. That company forwards your files to an independent translator somewhere else. “[It’s] an infinite chain of inheritance,” says DePalma. Twenty-six percent of the average translation company’s income comes from other translation companies, constituting one-fourth of all words translated worldwide. “As soon as [your file] goes outside the company,” he adds, “it's in the wild.” In the end, if no human resource is found, your project could wind up on Translation.com, except this time, you’re paying a translation provider to put it there. According to Common Sense Advisory, 64 percent of translation professionals say their colleagues frequently use free translation services on the web. “When [your data is] in the wild,” DePalma continues, “you then have to rely on the provisions, the security mechanisms, just the entire range of anybody who touches that information to keep it secret and secure.” That’s a lot of trust for a single vendor. So as the Russian proverb says, trust but verify. To track your data while it’s in translation, Vashee recommends translation management software (TMS), an industry-specific tool that tracks every word from the moment it leaves your office to the moment it comes back. With TMS, no one accesses data without your direct approval; files cannot be forwarded without your knowledge. “You go in and you provide access,” Vashee says. “If you say, ‘Here are 100 valid IDs and the only people that will be able to touch this data use these 100 valid IDs,’ [you’ll] be able to know exactly what they did every time they touched the data. “That’s a high level of security. A TMS system properly set up will give you some protection.” This protection isn’t perfect. TMS systems are sold to both translation companies and clients; advanced systems extract content directly from GitHub, Adobe CQ, and other platforms where it’s created. Ask how that connection is secured. Then ask where and how the TMS stores your files. Even more importantly, does the TMS you use let translators take data out? DePalma mentions that translators are prone to removing materials from TMS to move it into a tool they might like better. They log in, hit export, then suddenly your data is back in the wild. Tell your TMS provider that you want this option turned off. In the end, though, DePalma says no matter how well you lock down the tech, the riskiest part of any translation project is the translator: “Even if they couldn't pull [your data] out exactly, what they could do is a screen capture, then do an OCR, and then from that, put it into another tool.” To DePalma’s knowledge, this type of breach is simply “theoretical.” But before September, so was Statoil’s.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/11/08/equifax-says-it-owns-all-its-data-about-you/

Members of the Senate Commerce Committee challenged Equifax's chief executive Wednesday about the credit reporting agency's sweeping data collection and its one-sided relationship with millions of Americans whose personal information it harvests for profit. Equifax revealed in September that attackers may have compromised the sensitive information of as many as 145 million people. But for many Americans — and for Senators at Wednesday's hearing  — it was unclear why Equifax was storing information about them in the first place. The hearing into the data breaches -- the fifth so far -- featured testimony from current and former officials from Equifax, Yahoo and Verizon, and added to the uproar about the company's policies and its response to the breach. In one notable exchange, Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) asked the interim chief executive officer of Equifax, Paulino do Rego Barros, why consumers do not have a say in opting in or out of the company's data collection. “This is part of the way the economy works,” Barros said. But he was swiftly interrupted. “The consumer doesn't have a choice, sir. The consumer does not have a choice on the data that you’re collecting,” Masto said.   [I called Equifax with a simple question. This is what happened.]   Her line of questioning echoed other lawmakers who have pushed back against fundamental aspects of Equifax's business, which have faced widespread scrutiny after the data breach came to light. After confirming with Barros that it is Equifax, and not consumers, that owns all the granular data collected about them, and that consumers cannot request to exit the company's files, Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Col.) asked the current Equifax chief if it was right that the company maintains that arrangement. “I think it’s not my perspective to say it's right or wrong,” Barros said. When Marissa Mayer, the former chief executive of Yahoo was asked if consumers should own their own data, however, she said, “Yes. I believe that they should.” Even as Barros said it is up to Equifax to earn the public's trust, he did not commit to proactively notifying all the consumers who were potentially affected by the breach. “We are actively, actively engaged with consumers to make sure that they use the products that we have today,” Barros said when asked by Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), pointing to the company's Web page, social media and a team dedicated to engaging with consumers. Barros told the committee that 30 million people have visited Equifax's website to learn if their information was stolen. However, Baldwin suggested that was only a fraction of those who might have been affected by the breach. "30 million? Out of 145 million,” Baldwin said. Several senators on the panel said new legislation is needed to prod companies like Equifax and Yahoo to better protect consumer data. Such measures would grant the Federal Trade Commission greater powers to enforce “reasonable” cybersecurity standards and for the agency to impose fines on negligent businesses. “If we are going to do anything meaningful we must have the political will to hold these companies accountable,” said Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), the ranking member of the committee. “We can either take action with common sense rules or we can start planning for our next hearing on this issue.” During the four previous congressional hearings about the Equifax data breach, lawmakers took issue with the extended period of time it took the company to disclose the intrusion, its cybersecurity practices, and the use of arbitration clauses. Such clauses typically require customers to settle disputes they have with companies through a third party rather than going to court or joining a class-action lawsuit. On Wednesday, Equifax again, defended its use of arbitration. "We work according to the law and use the tools that the industry uses to have arbitration in place,” said Barros. Equifax is also facing multiple federal investigations over its handling of the hack and reports that executives sold an unusual amount of stock before the breach was publicly disclosed.

At the heart of every financial services firm’s operations is a team of data scientists whose job it is to take all of the information that comes in and structure it in a way that the rocket scientists and genius mathematicians on staff can turn into something useful for their equations and analysis. It’s a time-consuming, labor-intensive and difficult job that only a select few can handle. Those select few have now launched Crux Informatics to take over the data processing that big banks need done. The company is emerging from stealth with a $10 million investment led by Goldman Sachs, to manage what the company calls the “information supply chain” that’s beginning to get out of hand for most big institutions that live and die by data analysis. Goldman Sachs Principal Strategic Investments Group led the new round, which included additional undisclosed institutional investors, and will be used to expand the product suite for its large customers in the financial services industry. “The emergence of unstructured data as an important input into the investment process creates a great opportunity for financial institutions, but only if actionable insights can be extrapolated from it,” said Darren Cohen, global head of Goldman Sachs’ Principal Strategic Investments group, in a statement. “Crux’s innovative approach — coupled with their deep expertise in financial services and capital markets — brings economies of scale that will allow companies to be more agile, inventive and effective with data.” Think of Crux as a Switzerland for data storage and services. The company won’t reveal any information or resell to anyone else the proprietary information it processes and holds for its clients. It’s merely a processing engine for taking the data that big banks and businesses that depend on big data sets need, and crunches that data — reducing it to the metrics that matter most for the clients it serves. “Gathering information about the world, doing analysis, and driving unique insight is the life-blood of the financial industry”, said Philip Brittan, the chief executive officer of Crux, in a statement. “It is a hard process filled with numerous pain points. Crux is a unique new offering, created to help our clients much more easily find, explore, and make use of relevant data. We take on the burdensome and non-differentiating aspects of our customers’ information supply chains, so they can focus on what really matters for their business. In doing so, we strive to make data delightful.” Brittan and his founding executive team have a deep knowledge of the ways in which these data sets work. The former chief technology officer of Thomson Reuters financial risk division, Brittan previously worked as the former head of foreign exchange at Bloomberg and as the former chief of Google Finance before founding Crux. He’s joined by Larry Leibowitz, who previously worked as the COO and head of global equities listing and trading at Euronext, and Elizabeth Pritchard, who heads the company’s go-to-market strategy and previously worked at Goldman Sachs for 19 years as the company’s head of Market Data Services. On top of the deep data expertise of Crux’s founding team, the company has also rolled out a toolset for creating data pipelines, a set of APIs to connect with existing financial services applications and a provisioning system to provide audit trails to track who used the data in an organization.

  Crux, a data solutions provider, announced it raised $10 million
  in a Series A fundraising round led by Goldman Sachs.
 
  The company, which was founded by Philip Brittan, a three-time
  entrepreneur and former chief technology officer of financial
  juggernaut Thomson Reuters, is looking to address the pain points
  many Wall Street firms face when they're trying to make use of
  data.
 
  "We want to make data delightful," Brittan told Business Insider.
 
  CruxÂ announced the funding round backed by Goldman and a
  "small handful" of other strategic investors on Wednesday. The
  company declined to name those other investors and comment on its
  valuation.
 
  Data has become increasingly important to Wall Street. As noted
  by a recent report from Boston-based money managerÂ State
  Street, data has become a vital tool for firms to differentiate
  themselves and better serve clients.
  
  âUsing big data and digital technologies,we are able to price
  portfolios up to 30 minutes faster â which has had a
  transformative impact for our clients.â Liz Roaldsen, head of
  digital transformation at State Street, said.
 
  However, acquiring data, storing it, and then making sense of it,
  is a timely process for many firms and often draws resources away
  from actually figuring out ways to execute strategies based off
  the data you have. Brittan said he wants to take that
  non-differentiated grunt work off the hands of Wall Street's
  hedge funds, banks, and private equity firms.Â 
 
  "Just like how a logistics firm helps manufacturing company
  orchestrate supply chains, we are orchestrating the supply chain
  of data," Brittan said.
 
  As such, Crux doesn't just connect its customers with data from
  providers. Instead, it aims to help guide clients through the
  entire data supply chain, from acquiring data from providers to
  cleaning and preparing the data to then packaging it to clients
  in a way that's relevant for them.
 
  "If you're a hedge fund, for instance, you're going to spend most
  of your time cleaning data, storing it, and putting IT resources
  behind protecting it," Brittan said. "That takes weeks of toil
  and shifts focus away from actually creating alpha-driving
  solutions with that data that can differentiate the firm from the
  competition."
 
The deployment of new technologies such as data, according
  to a new report by Broadridge, a financial consultancy and tech
  provider, will 
  take place through a mixture of in-house development and third
  party 
  partnerships.
 
  "Given the imperative to cut costs and the opportunities offered
  by new technologies, many institutions are now actively seeking
  to embrace partners," the report titled "Pathways to Profit"
  said. "They are leveraging partnerships to add innovation in
  areas where they lack expertise or scale, or to enable them to
  focus the expertise they do have on their most differentiating
  areas."

Last Updated Nov 8, 2017 12:30 PM EST The Senate Commerce Committee is holding a hearing on consumer data security. Interim CEO of Equifax, Paulino do Rego Barros Jr. and former Equifax CEO Richard Smith are testifying as well as former Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer. Other witnesses include Verizon Communications Chief Privacy Officer Karen Zacharia; Entrust Datacard Corporation President and CEO Todd Wilkinson. Equifax revealed in early September that hackers had gained access to the personal information of 143 million U.S. consumers after exploiting a vulnerability on its website. Verizon said in early October that the 2013 Yahoo hack affected all three billion user accounts.  {"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"VideoObject","thumbnailUrl":"https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2017/10/06/318eb34e-acac-4648-9a20-db0d1b8602e9/gettyimages-857524294.jpg","embedUrl":"http://www.cbsnews.com/live/","name":"Live: Senate data breach hearing","description":"CBSN live coverage as the Senate Commerce Committee hears testimony from former Yahoo CEO Marissa Meyer and former Equifax CEO Richard Smith on data breaches","contentRating":"MPAA PG-13","videoQuality":"720p","publication":{"@type":"BroadcastEvent","isLiveBroadcast":true,"startDate":"2017-11-08T15:30:00.000Z"},"uploadDate":"2017-11-08T15:30:00.000Z"} Barros confirmed that Equifax is working on an app that would allow consumers to lock and unlock personal credit data, providing consumers with more control. In an exchange with Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minnesota, Barros said that the company is on time to deliver the product in January and it's being developed right now. He said that it has all of the security needs and requirements that are in compliance with security. In an exchange with Sen. Todd Young, R-Indiana, he said that Mayer testified that the 2014 breach was state-sponsored, but asked if the 2013 breach's origins have been determined. "We have not been able to determine who perpetrated the 2013 breach," she said. Mayer said that she learned of the breaches at the scale reported in 2016, but learned of a Russian intrusion into the network in Dec. 2014. The Wisconsin Democrat asked Barros if he can commit to proactively notifying every person affected by the company's data breach. "We have been notifying; we have been working with consumers," said Barros, who added that the company is also improving social media and engaging with consumers. Baldwin asked him again to commit to notifying everyone affected and Barros only said that the company is actively engaged with consumers. Zacharia said that the two key items that should appear in data breach legislation include a national framework so that companies have one standard to comply with when they're responding to a data breach. The other item is that companies get the standard right for when they notify customers about a breach. She said that there should be a balance between notify customers when important information is stolen and not notifying them too often. Nelson said that Mayer admitted in her testimony that Yahoo was not protected enough against a state actor. He then asked Zacharia what Verizon is doing to make sure that Yahoo is protected. Zacharia said that Verizon must work with both industry and government to tackle the problem of data security. She said that Verizon has "long believed" that there should be national data security and data breach legislation and said her company is open to collaborating with senators on such measures. She also said that because security isn't static and attackers are always getting better at their techniques, she said that Verizon has to make sure that it's also constantly changing its security. Nelson said that while she conveyed "good intention," he said said, "it's going to take more. "It's going to take an attitude change among companies such as your's," Nelson said, adding that they must go to "extreme limits" to protect customers' privacy. The South Dakota Republican asked why it took Yahoo more than three years to discover and disclose the breach. Mayer said that Yahoo "deeply valued our users' security" and that the company has still not been able to identify the intrusion that led to the theft. She said that Yahoo doesn't exactly understand "how the act was perpetrated." She said that this led to areas where Yahoo had gaps in its information. Thune asked again why it was three years for Yahoo to disclose the breach and why it underestimated the number of people affected by billions. Mayer said that Yahoo didn't know about the intrusion in 2013. She said that the company learned about the intrusion by files presented to Yahoo in November 2016 and verified that the data was taken in 2013. Zacharia said that the review of the data theft from 2013 confirmed that the stolen information didn't include Social Security numbers and sensitive financial data, among other information. At the time of the theft, she said that Yahoo required password changes for user accounts and invalidated unencrypted security questions. She said that this means "Yahoo took steps in 2016 to protect all users." Mayer said that Yahoo worked hard over the year to earn the trust of users. She said that the data thefts occurred during her tenure and she said she "sincerely" apologizes to those affected. Mayer said once the theft was exposed, it was "promptly" reported to law enforcement. She said that Yahoo worked closely with law enforcement, including the FBI, to expose those responsible, which she noted were Russian intelligence officers and state-sponsored actors. Barros said that Equifax is focused every day on strengthening security and providing better support to consumers. He said his company has taken certain steps in recent weeks since the breach to improve security. Barros said that his highest priority is to improve services for consumers and as a result, he has visited call centers, spoken to consumers directly and has made improvements to social media and the consumer experience. Barros said that it has resulted in a "substantial reduction in delays and backlogs." He also said that there was a corporate restructuring which involves the chief security officer reporting directly to him. The Florida Democrat said that stiffer enforcement and stringent penalties are the only way to incentivize companies to properly protect consumers' information and to inform consumers when breaches take place.

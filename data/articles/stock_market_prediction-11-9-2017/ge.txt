Chris Bryant is a Bloomberg Gadfly columnist covering industrial companies. He previously worked for the Financial Times. One justification for industrial conglomerates is that expertise (technological or regulatory) from one part of the group can inform decisions in another. A second is that having diverse businesses helps if one runs into trouble. Siemens AG&apos;s earnings update on Thursday was a reminder of why these arguments often don&apos;t hold water. An otherwise good set of yearly results was marred by simultaneous troubles at its wind and fossil-power divisions. Understanding renewables doesn&apos;t seem to have helped the German giant fully grasp the negative consequences caused by their arrival. Luckily, Siemens seems to have learned its lesson and is ditching a rigid conglomerate structure. Arch-rival General Electric Co. should think about doing the same. Under chief executive Joe Kaeser&apos;s leadership, Siemens is much better run these days. The stock has risen more than 50 percent during his four-year tenure, as Kaeser sold non-core units and eradicated one-off charges. Net profit has risen about 40 percent. Blotting his copybook are two businesses related to power generation. Siemens&apos;s wind unit, recently merged with Spain&apos;s Gamesa, lost money in the most recent quarter and is slashing 6,000 jobs. Its power and gas division is poised for similar. Siemens hasn&apos;t said how many jobs will be lost from its gas turbine factories, but it&apos;ll be more than a handful. Profit has slumped at both Siemens and GE&apos;s fossil-power divisions. Intuitively, this makes no sense. The old narrative on the transformation of energy markets went something like this: Dirty coal power plants will gradually be displaced by wind and solar, with gas turbines providing "cleaner" electricity at night and when it&apos;s not windy. So Siemens&apos;s wind and gas turbine units should both be doing well, right? Things haven&apos;t been quite so simple. While companies are producing more clean power, we&apos;re consuming less. Household electricity consumption has started falling in Europe and the U.S. Renewables depress wholesale electricity prices, making it uneconomical for utilities to operate gas-fired power plants. Underused gas turbines don&apos;t need as much lucrative maintenance work and their role as backup power providers is threatened by battery storage. The large gas turbine market is almost two-thirds smaller than Siemens and others expected in 2010. German utilities have ordered only two turbines in the past three years, Mr Kaeser noted. Competition is fierce, pushing down prices. And what of wind? Shares in market leader Vestas Wind Systems A/S plunged by 20 percent on Thursday because a shift toward auction-based tenders is hurting prices -- something Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy SA flagged too. Plus there&apos;s Donald Trump, who&apos;s doing his darnedest to roll back wind power subsidies. In fairness, Siemens has warned about its fossil-power troubles for years. Still, a globe-spanning conglomerate that can arrange a meeting with a president at the drop of a hat, should be better at spotting technical and regulatory shifts. Within a sprawling group, poorly-performing units can hide behind the success of others. To make Siemens nimbler, Kaeser is moving toward more of a holding structure. The wind business has a separate listing, the train unit will have one if a merger with Alstom SA is approved and the healthcare division is poised for an IPO. This doesn&apos;t mean they won&apos;t suffer from adverse markets -- Siemens Gamesa&apos;s start has been uncomfortable. But it does give a sharper focus and more accountability. Investors seem to agree this is the right path. Siemens stock has far outperformed GE&apos;s in the past four years. "We&apos;ve understood that old-fashioned conglomerates no longer have a future," Kaeser says. He&apos;s talking to you, GE.

A gas turbine sits on the assembly line at the General Electric Co. energy plant in Greenville, South Carolina. General Electric Co.’s new boss says he’ll unload $20 billion in assets. Wall Street wonders if that’s enough. With several divisions slumping and the stock dropping to a five-year low last week, Chief Executive Officer John Flannery is under rising pressure to shake up the 125-year-old manufacturer. One potential strategy to unlock value would be a portfolio overhaul, with analysts broaching the possibility of a more sweeping breakup. “Flannery will eventually need to break GE apart in a more aggressive fashion,” Scott Davis, head of Melius Research, said in a recent note. The CEO’s plan, which calls for GE to sell or spin off assets amounting to roughly 15 percent of the company’s total, is “hardly a big change,” Davis said. “We think 50 percent is more in the ballpark of what’s needed.” GE’s stock has plunged 36 percent this year, by far the worst in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, cutting the market value to $175 billion. That’s almost $90 billion below what the company should be worth, based on the anticipated future earnings of each business unit, according to Melius. Flannery is poised Nov. 13 to unveil how he intends to reshape GE. “Everything is on the table,” he told investors last month.  Here’s a look at what might -- and might not -- be on the block. This crown jewel, which makes jet engines, probably isn’t going anywhere. But that doesn’t mean it will look the same. One question is whether upheaval in the aircraft-parts market -- highlighted by United Technologies Corp.’s pending acquisition of Rockwell Collins Inc. -- will put assets such as GE’s avionics operation in play. With gas turbines slumping, the power division has been a big source of headaches, leading some analysts to suggest that the entire business would be a potential candidate for sale or spinoff. More realistic would be for GE to unload portions of GE Power, including the Jenbacher and Waukesha gas-engine businesses, Davis said. Investors and analysts long have debated whether the unit, which sells medical scanners, makes sense with GE’s other businesses. Flannery, who ran GE Healthcare before becoming CEO, has defended its position. Still, GE could look to shed portions of the business, including information technology. GE took a step away from the tough oil and gas market this year by combining the unit with Baker Hughes, a company in which GE now owns a majority stake. GE may opt for a full separation through a “staged exit” of its remaining holding, according to Deane Dray, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets. This operation’s highest-profile unit, the jet-leasing business known as Gecas, could be sold or spun off, according to Davis. The division “is an amazing asset and throws off a lot of cash,” he said in a note. “Gecas would be able to take on higher levels of debt and could be outright bought by someone else.” The France-based division is poised to capitalize on clean-energy trends, with sizable wind and hydroelectric businesses. That could make it a valuable asset for sale. Many analysts believe the locomotive-manufacturing operation will be one of the first to go under Flannery. GE Transportation has struggled amid a downturn in the rail market and a trend toward electrification. Jamie Miller was the division’s CEO until last month, when she was promoted to chief financial officer of the parent company. The small division is already undergoing changes. GE said earlier this year that it would get rid of the consumer light-bulb operations. A sale of its commercial lighting business, known as Current, is also possible, said Jeff Sprague, an analyst at Vertical Research Partners. 

https://stocknews.com/news/ge-general-electrics-aircraft-leasing-unit-next-on-the-chopping-block/

GE – Reuters reports that GE is exploring a sale of its highly lucrative aircraft leasing business. General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) is reportedly in talks to sell off one of its best-performing business units, amid rising pressure from overseas competitors. Reuters was first to report GE’s negotiations to potentially jettison its lucrative aircraft leasing business: GE’s move on GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS), the world’s second-largest lessor, follows expressions of interest from some of its competitors, the sources said. A spin-off of the business is also a possibility, the sources said, cautioning that GE may decide to keep the business. The move comes at a time when a flood of Chinese funding is shaping the $260 billion-strong aircraft leasing industry as a significant new asset class. The potential move could include selling part or all of GECAS, Reuters’ sources say. GECAS has a fleet of approximately 1,300 planes that it leases to customers, which rent planes instead of buying them in order to avoid the high fixed costs of ownership. GE’s fleet is worth an estimated $25 billion. General Electric’s new CEO John Flannery is on the hunt for ways to raise cash and streamline operations amid a historically weak period for the conglomerate and its stock. Hundreds, if not thousands, of high-paying jobs are likely to be slashed in coming months as part of the efforts as well. General Electric Company shares rose $0.10 (+0.49%) in premarket trading Wednesday. Year-to-date, GE has declined -34.34%, versus a 17.37% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period. GE currently has a StockNews.com POWR Rating of C (Neutral), and is ranked #20 of 34 stocks in the Industrial – Manufacturing category.

European aluminum producer Norsk Hydro (OTCQX:NHYDY, OTCQX:NHYKF) says it will buy most of the electricity from an €800M wind farm in Sweden, in an example of the rising importance of industrial energy users in driving uptake of renewable power. Norsk Hydro will buy a fixed volume of electricity for 19 years from the 650 MW Markbygden wind farm, which will increase Swedish wind power capacity by more than 12%. Australian bank Macquarie, which is financing the project with GE, says the deal is the biggest of its kind with a corporate energy consumer for wind power. Power purchase agreements by large companies are well established in the U.S., where tech firms including Apple and Google have been prominent in underwriting development of wind and solar projects, but the Norsk Hydro deal shows how the trend also is rising in Europe.

https://stocknewsgazette.com/2017/11/08/checking-out-the-fundamental-data-for-general-electric-company-ge-2/

General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) seems to be forming a pattern of major movements, providing only some crumbs of outlook for market participants trying to figure out its next move. Now trading with a market value of 173.52B, the company has a mix of catalysts and obstacles that spring from the nature of its operations. Everyone seems to have their own opinion of this stock. But what do the numbers really say? We think it’s a great time to take a fresh look. General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Fundamentals That Matter It’s generally a good idea to start with the most fundamental piece of the picture: the balance sheet. The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For GE, the company currently has 39.85 billion of cash on the books, which is offset by 28.13 billion in current liabilities. The trend over time is important to note. In this case, the company’s debt has been falling. The company also has 378.04 billion in total assets, balanced by 280.54 billion in total liabilities, which should give you a sense of the viability of the company under any number of imagined business contexts. General Electric Company (GE) saw -578 million in free cash flow last quarter, representing a quarterly net change in cash of -4.22 billion. Perhaps most importantly where cash movements are concerned, the company saw about 1.02 billion in net operating cash flow.

 General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Revenue Growth Potential As far as key trends that demonstrate something of the future investment potential of this stock, we need to take a closer look at the top line, first and foremost. Last quarter, the company saw 31.22 billion in total revenues. That represents a quarterly year/year change in revenues of 0.07 in sequential terms, the GE saw sales decline by 0.07. But what about the bottom line? After all, that’s what really matters in the end. General Electric Company (GE) is intriguing when broken down to its core data. The cost of selling goods last quarter was 23.29 billion, yielding a gross basic income of 7.93 billion. For shareholders, given the total diluted outstanding shares of 8.73 billion, this means overall earnings per share of 0.20. Note, this compares with a consensus analyst forecast of 0.28 in earnings per share for its next fiscal quarterly report. 
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Is General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Valuation Attractive Looking ahead at valuations, according to the consensus, the next fiscal year is forecast to bring about 1.15 in total earnings per share. If we consider a median price to earnings ratio on the stock, that corresponds with a stock price of 18.31. However, one should always remember: the trends are more important than the forecasts. This continues to be an interesting story, and we look forward to updating it again soon on General Electric Company.

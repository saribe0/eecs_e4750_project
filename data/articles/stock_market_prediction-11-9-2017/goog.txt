 The top gainer with a security that increased in price during today’s trading was Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). Alphabet Inc. had a higher price at the close than it did at the open. The company holds a market cap of 708.05B with a P/E of 37.69 indicating whether its share price properly reflects its performance. Fundamentalists and value investors are seeing the low ratio of 7.13 as more positive – demonstrating that the company has a great deal of revenue with a fair price. However, technicians believes that a higher ratio would indicate the likelihood of a constant augmentation of the company’s share price. Alphabet Inc.’s P/B is valued at 4.86 exhibiting the investor sentiment on the value of the stock to its actual value. A higher P/B ratio of Alphabet Inc. is signposting that the investors have either overvalued it , or that its accountants have undervalued it. The P/B figure is also providing some ideas on whether the shareholders are paying too much for what would be left if the company went bankrupt immediately – but to consider that the company ought to have a lower P/B value. As of now, the increased share price of Alphabet Inc. makes it a lucrative buy for investors. A change of 0.63% in the price clearly indicates a strong asset performance for the corporation, , bearing in mind the total returns from its investment and dividends or distributions obtained from the investment. The ROA of Alphabet Inc. is currently valued at *tba indicating how profitable the company is in regards to its total assets. The figure tells us what earnings were generated from invested capital of Alphabet Inc.. It gives investors a clue on how effective the company is in converting the money it has to invest into net income. Alphabet Inc.’s ROI is valued at *tba relatively measuring the profitability on the investment. It evidently points out how profitable and preferable it is for the investors. The company has a current ratio of *tba gauging towards its ability in paying short-term and long-term obligations. With the existing current ratio, Alphabet Inc. is more than equipped to confront its liabilities with its assets. Alphabet Inc. has a quick ratio of *tba measuring its ability to meet its short term obligations with its most liquid assets. The high quick ratio specifies its better liquidity position on the credit terms the company has negotiated from its suppliers. The EPS growth this year is at -6.90% demonstrating an EPS growth of 29.10% in the coming year. This defines the most likely future of the stock price of Alphabet Inc.. With this high EPSGR it is predicted that growth rate will rise faster as compared to its competitors in the same industry. As it upholds an amended rate with more EPSGR it is prone to be a good target. Alphabet Inc. NASDAQ : GOOG | Thursday, November 9, 2017    Tags (NASDAQ:GOOG) Alphabet Inc.

The S&P 500 approached its highest ever close on Wednesday as a rally in videogame makers helped offset doubts about an ambitious Republican plan to cut corporate taxes and weakness in banks. Apple rose 0.65 percent, putting it on track to end the day with a market value above $900 billion for the first time. Take-Two Interactive Software jumped 10.8 percent after the videogame maker offered a stronger-than-expected revenue forecast for the holiday quarter. That sparked a rally among its competitors, with Activision Blizzard surging 5.80 percent and Electronic Arts adding 1.9 percent. Investors were nervous about the potential outcome of the Republican plan unveiled last week that would cut corporate taxes while eliminating a range of popular tax breaks. The bill is expected to face strong opposition from interest groups. Republicans have yet to score a major legislative win since Trump took office in January, even though the party controls both chambers of Congress as well as the White House. (Source: Reuters) The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 6.13 points, or 0.03 percent, to 23,563.36, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 3.73 points, or 0.14 percent, to 2,594.37 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 21.34 points, or 0.32 percent, to 6,789.12. Top Pick for Thursday: Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) has grabbed attention from the analysts when it experienced a change of 0.63% in the last trading session to close at $1039.85. A total of 1,088,240 shares exchanged hands during the intra-day trade contrast with its average trading volume of 1.34M shares, while its relative volume stands at 0.81. Relative volume is the comparison of current volume to average volume for the same time of day, and it’s displayed as a ratio. If RVOL is less than 1 it is not In Play on this trading day and Investors may decide not to trade it.  If RVOL is above 2 it is In Play and this is more evidence Investors ought to be in the name.  When stocks are *very* In Play one can see a RVOL of 5 and above.  The higher the RVOL the more In Play the stock is. Day traders strive to make money by exploiting minute price movements in individual assets (usually stocks, though currencies, futures, and options are traded as well), usually leveraging large amounts of capital to do so, therefore they trade on Stocks in Play. In Play Stocks are volatile enough to produce good risk and reward trading opportunities for both bull and bear traders intraday. Most company stocks have very little volatility. They generally move extremely slowly and they only produce big price swings when the company produces good or bad trading results, which may only happen a couple of times a year at best. In deciding what to focus on – in a stock, say – a typical day trader looks for three things: liquidity, volatility and trading volume. Liquidity allows an investor to enter and exit a stock at a good price (i.e. tight spreads, or the difference between the bid and ask price of a stock, and low slippage, or the difference between the predictable price of a trade and the actual price). If a stock does not have good liquidity then it may take some time before a broker is able to negotiate a deal to buy or sell a stock and the broker may not be able to get the sell or buy price that the trader is looking for. This is a problem for day traders and it could mean the difference between a profitable and non-profitable trade. Traders have different rules for what constitutes liquidity and a good guide is the volume of trades and volume of shares that are traded each day. 100,000 shares traded per day would be a minimum for most traders and some require 1,000,000. Trading volume is a gauge of how many times a stock is bought and sold in a given time period (most commonly, within a day of trading, known as the average daily trading volume – ADTV). A high degree of volume indicates a lot of interest in a stock. Often, a boost in the volume of a stock is a harbinger of a price jump, either up or down. Volatility is simply a measure of the predictable daily price range—the range in which a day trader operates. More volatility means greater profit or loss. After a recent check, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) stock is found to be 1.20% volatile for the week, while 1.39% volatility is recorded for the month. Technical’s Snapshot: The stock has a market cap of $708.05B and the number of outstanding shares has been calculated 680.92M. Based on a recent bid, its distance from 20 days simple moving average is 4.00%, and its distance from 50 days simple moving average is 7.93% while it has a distance of 14.31% from the 200 days simple moving average. The company’s distance from 52-week high price is -0.81% and the current price is 42.93% away from 52-week low price. The company has Relative Strength Index (RSI 14) of 73.47 together with Average True Range (ATR 14) of 15.45. Stock’s Valuation: Past 5 years growth of GOOG observed at N/A, and for the next five years the analysts that follow this company is expecting its growth at 20.90%. The stock’s price to sales ratio for trailing twelve months is 7.13 and price to book ratio for the most recent quarter is 4.86, whereas price to cash per share for the most recent quarter are N/A. Its quick ratio for the most recent quarter is N/A. Analysts mean recommendation for the stock is 1.60. This number is based on a 1 to 5 scale where 1 indicates a Strong Buy recommendation while 5 represents a Strong Sell.

Sign up for our daily recaps of the ever-changing search marketing landscape. Google parent Alphabet announced third-quarter results. Both revenues and earnings per share beat Wall Street estimates. The company reported roughly $27.8 billion in total revenues (up 24 percent), with Google contributing all but $302 million of that amount. Earnings per share were $9.57, which was about $1.24 higher than expected. Advertising generated just over $24 billion in quarterly revenue. Operating income was about $7.8 billion. However, traffic acquisition costs (TAC) rose to $3.1 billion (vs. $2.6 billion a year ago). There are sure to be analyst questions about that item. The revenue breakdown by segment: Paid clicks on Google properties were up 6 percent year over year and aggregate cost per click (CPC) was up 1 percent. Here’s more detail: Paid click growth was significant. However, CPCs were down (18 percent) from a year ago but up slightly (1 percent) from last quarter. Alphabet (GOOG) shares are up in after-hours trading. The company says it now has more than 78,000 employees, compared with just under 70,000 a year ago. The earnings call webcast is happening now.

Time is a flat circle. Alphabet announced its third-quarter earnings today (Oct. 26), and yet again, it brought in a ton of cash, almost entirely from Google’s advertising business. The company generated $27.8 billion in revenue, up 24% from the same quarter last year, making this Alphabet’s highest-revenue quarter ever. (The previous record was $26.06 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016.) Roughly $24.1 billion of that revenue, or about 87%, came from Google’s ad sales. Alphabet reported $7.8 billion in profit for the quarter, up about 35% from the same period a year earlier. Most of the remainder of Alphabet’s revenue, about $3.4 billion, came from other revenue streams at Google, including hardware sales, cloud services, and sales of subscription services like YouTube TV and Google Play music, chief financial officer Ruth Porat said on the company’s earnings call. Just $302 million (around 1% of Alphabet’s revenue) came from sales from every other Alphabet company, lumped into the “Other Bets” bucket of its earnings. Analysts surveyed ahead of earnings had expected Alphabet to only bring in around $22 billion in revenue. The large beat saw the company’s Class A shares rising over $40 (about 4%) in after-hours trading. It remains to be seen whether investors will tire of Alphabet relying on the same old revenue sources. The company has been massively successful selling ads against search results on its own sites and apps, and selling ads on other companies’ websites. While those businesses show no signs of slowing, Alphabet has also invested billions into researching and developing a series of ambitious “moonshot” projects. It’s unclear whether those so-called Other Bets will ever be as important to Alphabet’s bottom line as its search engine has been. Those moonshots include self-driving cars at Waymo, internet-beaming balloons and delivery drones in the X research lab, defeating death at Calico, and myriad other companies. They have largely been money pits for Alphabet since the company spun them out from its core Google business in 2015. The only real revenue that’s come out of Other Bets to date has been hardware sales from Nest, Alphabet’s internet-of-things device company, and Fiber, its fiber-optic internet service.

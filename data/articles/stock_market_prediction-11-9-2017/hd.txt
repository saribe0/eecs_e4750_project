http://www.nasdaq.com/article/interesting-march-2018-stock-options-for-hd-cm872463

Consistently, one of the more popular stocks people enter into their stock options watchlist  at Stock Options Channel is Home Depot Inc (Symbol: HD). So this week we highlight one interesting put contract, and one interesting call contract, from the March 2018 expiration for HD. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting, is at the $155 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $4.05. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 2.6% return against the $155 commitment, or a 7.3% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost  ).      Selling a put does not give an investor access to HD's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. So unless Home Depot Inc sees its shares decline 5.2% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $150.95 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $4.05 from $155), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 7.3% annualized rate of return.  makeArticleAd();  Interestingly, that annualized 7.3% figure actually exceeds the 2.2% annualized dividend paid by Home Depot Inc by 5.1%, based on the current share price of $163.52. And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to lose 5.24% to reach the $155 strike price.    Always important when discussing dividends is the fact that, in general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Home Depot Inc, looking at the dividend history chart for HD below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 2.2% annualized dividend yield.    Turning to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the March 2018 expiration, for shareholders of Home Depot Inc (Symbol: HD) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 2.2% annualized dividend yield. Selling the covered call at the $170 strike and collecting the premium based on the $3.95 bid, annualizes to an additional 6.8% rate of return against the current stock price (this is what we at Stock Options Channel refer to as the YieldBoost  ), for a total of 9% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $170 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but HD shares would have to advance 3.9% from current levels for that to occur, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 6.3% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.    The chart below shows the trailing twelve month trading history for Home Depot Inc, highlighting in green where the $155 strike is located relative to that history, and highlighting the $170 strike in red:       The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the March 2018 put or call options highlighted in this article deliver a rate of return that represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Home Depot Inc (considering the last 252 trading day HD historical stock prices  using closing values, as well as today's price of $163.52) to be 14%.    In mid-afternoon trading on Monday, the put volume among S&P 500 components was 1.03M contracts, with call volume at 1.77M, for a put:call ratio of 0.58 so far for the day. Compared to the long-term median put:call ratio of .65, that represents high call volume relative to puts; in other words, buyers are showing a preference for calls in  options trading  so far today.

Top YieldBoost HD Calls »             Turning to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the March 2018 expiration, for shareholders of Home Depot Inc (Symbol: HD) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 2.2% annualized dividend yield. Selling the covered call at the $170 strike and collecting the premium based on the $3.95 bid, annualizes to an additional 6.8% rate of return against the current stock price (this is what we at Stock Options Channel refer to as the YieldBoost  ), for a total of 9% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $170 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but HD shares would have to advance 3.9% from current levels for that to occur, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 6.3% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.

http://www.nasdaq.com/article/is-an-earnings-beat-in-store-for-home-depot-hd-in-q3-cm872870

 We expect leading home improvement retailer, The Home Depot, Inc.HD to beat expectations when it reports third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 14. In the last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.8%.
 Moreover, the company has a spectacular positive earnings surprise record for five years now. For the trailing four quarters, the company has delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 3.8%. Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?
 The question lingering in investors' minds now is whether Home Depot will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is $1.81 per share, up 12.9% from the year-ago quarter. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter has moved up in the last 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks anticipate revenues of $24.4 billion, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 5.4%.  Home Depot, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Home Depot, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Home Depot, Inc. (The) Quote Moreover, we note that the stock has outperformed the industry year to date. The company's shares have increased 22.5%, while the industry grew 16.9%. This solid growth comes on the back of a spectacular surprise history and growth strategies, including an interconnected strategy and focus on Pro customers. Factors at Play
 Home Depot has been gaining from strong earnings trends, robust outlook, efforts to improve customer experience along with promising capital strategy. Additionally a recovering housing market and the rehabilitation process following the hurricanes have been aiding its performance.
 The company has been displaying solid growth across all regions, both in stores and online. Further, Pro category sales continue to outperform, driven by constant efforts to enrich customers' experiences.
 Additionally, the company's comparable store sales (comps) trend has been encouraging as it has surpassed the Zacks comps estimate for over two years now. In the most recent quarter, the company's comps improved 6.3%, surpassing the Zacks estimate of 4.7%. Comps growth was aided by robust average ticket, which also topped the Zacks Consensus mark. For the third-quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for average ticket is pegged at 61.
 Home Depot's second-quarter fiscal 2017 results gained from growth across the company's interconnected platform as well as all regions. The company's relentless focus on affording innovative products, boosting interconnected customer experience and driving productivity seems to be paying off. Additionally, housing market recovery remains a tailwind.
 The sturdy first half and expectations of improved home prices and re-emergence of first-time homebuyers, encouraged the company to raise fiscal 2017 view. The company anticipates sales growth of nearly 5.3%, alongside a 5.5% increase in comps. Moreover, management now anticipates earnings per share to increase about 13% to $7.29 in fiscal 2017.What the Zacks Model Unveils?
 Our proven model shows that Home Depot is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Earnings ESP of +0.76% and the company's Zacks Rank #2 makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.

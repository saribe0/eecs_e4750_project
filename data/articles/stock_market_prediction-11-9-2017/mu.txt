When I wrote about Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) stock almost a month ago, I outlined a compelling bull case seen in few other stocks. Since the publication of that article, the stock has risen almost 10%. The case for buying MU stock remains just as strong now. However, the history of the stock is one of large moves in both directions. Since the 1990s, the stock has risen when memory prices remained high and sold off when those prices collapsed. Although MU stock remains a strong buy today, Micron investors should understand the history of the stock and buy and sell accordingly. Given the large increase, investors will naturally assume that they missed the boat. The MU stock price now stands in the mid $40s per share, up from the $10 per share range eighteen months ago. Rarely does an S&P 500 stock rise that much in that short of a time span. However, given that the stock’s PE ratio stands at about 10 despite the increase, the MU bulls have room to run. Many stocks with comparable growth have PE ratios five-or-more times this high. No market analyst can guarantee another fourfold increase. While I’m not predicting an increase that size, it remains possible. Moreover, the Micron Technology news on growth numbers is extraordinary. Revenue growth is approaching 70% for FY 2017. This brings the forward price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio in the 0.60 range for MU stock. The average PEG ratio for the S&P 500 is 1.33, almost twice that figure. Rarely do prospective buyers see such a solid buy case on an equity. However, successfully investing in Micron for the long term means understanding the equity’s history. MU stock reached its all-time high of $97 per share in July 2000, driven by the lofty valuations of the 1990s-technology boom. The stock has not traded that high since, and the current price remains over 50% below the record. However, given the current PE and PEG ratios, the MU stock price could finally take out that all-time high. The question remains, how long can the rally last and how far will it go? Again, history can serve as a possible guide. In late 2012, MU stock traded at below $6 per share before enjoying a run to $36 per share by the end of 2014. However, memory prices subsequently collapsed in 2015, and the stock fell to below $10 per share by 2016. The cycle has been repeated a few times over the last quarter of a century. The stock moved to almost $48 per share back in 1995 before falling back below $9 per share by July 1996.

Missouri volleyball had a comfortable 19-15 lead in the fourth set of Wednesday's matchup against South Carolina. The Tigers were up 2-1 in the match and looked to be in cruise control on their way to a fifth straight win.  The Gamecocks then rattled off a 7-0 run and ended up winning the fourth set 25-22, forcing a decisive fifth set. A similar theme played out in the fifth set as the Tigers were all but celebrating the victory with a 14-9 lead. South Carolina then made another furious comeback, scoring five straight points to tie up the set. The Tigers then dug deep and with a service ace from Melanie Crow, were able to take the set 16-14 and the match 3-2.  The win was not pretty but the Tigers improved to 17-9 (10-3 SEC) as every win counts late in the season on their way to a possible NCAA tournament bid. The Tigers also sit in third place overall in SEC standings. "I thought tonight was a good example of having to find a way when things aren't going as smoothly as you'd like," coach Wayne Kreklow said in a release. "Our serve and pass game was really off, which made things very difficult." Leketor Member-Meneh recorded 11 kills for the Tigers after landing awkwardly in the second set, injuring her left leg. She was helped off the court by her teammates, but came back shortly to help her team to victory. Alyssa Munlyn was brilliant at the net yet again, recording five blocks in the match. She also became the Missouri single-season individual block assist record holder with her 125th of the season. The Tigers had an impressive .406 hitting percentage in the match and limited themselves to 12 errors compared to South Carolina's 19. Mikayla Shields recorded 29 kills, her personal best, for the Gamecocks in the losing effort. "Winning on the road in the SEC is not easy and tonight was just another example of that," Kreklow said. Missouri next faces No. 3 Florida on Sunday afternoon in Gainesville, in what will be a very tough test for the Tigers. The game will be broadcast on SEC Network.

 WEBZEN today announced the worldwide opening of its acclaimed ARPG MU Legend. It marks the culmination of a one-year-long journey, punctuated by two closed beta tests and one stress test, since preparations began for the release of one of WEBZEN's most anticipated games.  Dennis Czybulka, COO at Webzen Dublin, acknowledged the occasion with these words: "Launching a game is always a high-stakes moment to live through, where hundreds of emotions collide. Here, in the 'OBT backstage', I am witnessing - let me put it like this - 'an exotic diversity of exhilarated states of mind ': The chills of enthusiasm are making hairs stand on end, adding a frenetic edge to the usual finger-tapping rhythm - still not missing a beat - and hearts are hammering faster than usual. Now, the fun starts for the fans, and our attention is focused entirely on making their game experience the most unforgettable yet. We're excited for players to experience first-hand the passion that we've put into MU Legend and look forward to seeing them all in-game." â The open beta is a "last preparation step", and players will retain all game data (characters, purchases, items, etc.) even after the day of the official release. Players no longer have to worry about any data wipes and can now take as much time as they need to explore the deep content offered by the game. Stating it clearly, there will be NO WIPE at all during or after the OBT period.  Although all game content has been made available today, further expansions are already in the pipeline. Developers are planning to deploy updates and extensions on a regular basis, with a 3v3-combat feature to arrive in the first update before the end of the year. This feature will offer a dynamic PvP environment, involving strategy and team coordination. Other new content, including territory wars, is slated to arrive soon after.  Additionally, thousands of players are due to receive their first special titles, awarded for participating in the CBTs and the stress test. The MU Legend team has announced that these marks of recognition will be delivered to those early pioneers on November 14th, 2017.  The team also offered a final comment: "It would have been almost impossible to carry the MU Legend dream this far - more than a decade after the launch of MU Online - without the support of the fans. We'd like to express our warmest thanks to all our players who've continued to have faith in this dream, and we hope that they'll enjoy the game as much as we've enjoyed developing it." Interested gamers can play MU Legend here or learn more about the game here.

The reduction in the number of meals in the two most affordable plans is based on surveys to determine how many meals students are actually eating in the dining halls.Room rates will fall 5 percent in Hatch Hall and 2.2 percent in Gillett, Hudson, Wolpers and Gateway halls, Cartwright said.“I understand what it takes to do the hard work to be able pay for an education,” Cartwright said. “This is an opportunity for us to try to reduce those costs as much as we can.”As enrollment has fallen, the university has faced increasing competition from private student housing, with some offering signing bonuses of up to $1,000 and others offering to buy incoming freshmen out of residence hall contracts. The university has seven residence halls that have been closed or are seeing limited use because freshman enrollment is down more than 30 percent over two years.At an announcement on campus, Cartwright said the move is part of continuing efforts to make MU more affordable. The university has made more open-source textbooks available to students free of charge, cutting the total student spending on course materials by $1.8 million, he said. The Land Grant Compact, announced earlier this year, will cover tuition for Pell Grant-eligible students and 100 percent of unmet needs for Pell-eligible students in the honors college.University regulations require first-time freshmen to live in residence halls unless they receive a waiver. That loophole was exploited by the new student housing apartment complex on Ninth Street, The Rise, to seek tenants as it prepared to open for the fall semester.The university does not want to fill the halls by stricter enforcement of that rule, Vice Chancellor for Operations Gary Ward said. Instead, it wants to attract students to stay through their sophomore year — 275 have signed up already for next year, he said — and cutting the price is a way to do that. “Instead of trying to be heavy-handed, we want to earn it,” Ward said.MU owes $317 million toward construction bonds that financed residence halls. The annual payment of principal and interest is about $22.5 million per year. Reduced enrollment has not put the school's ability to make those payments in jeopardy but it has made it harder to maintain a balance for capital needs, Ward said. The rate cuts will be made up by an additional 50 students living in residence halls, said Alysha O'Neil, budget director for student affairs.Ward said he expects to do better than that."I am very confident we will be able to attract additional freshmen in to the residential life halls and we will be able to attract returning students," he said.One source of new residence hall tenants could be fraternity members. A report from Dyad Strategies on the Office of Greek Life at MU recommended ending the practice of allowing freshmen to live in chapter houses rather than residence halls.Whether that recommendation will be fully implemented is still an open question, Ward said."The idea is we are bringing Dyad back late this winter and spring, to work with our campus community to get a better idea of how we are going to implement their recommendations," he said.During the announcement, Cartwright touted the benefits of residence hall living. The price is all-inclusive, covering cleaning, laundry services, security and participation in freshman interest groups to support studies, he said.“It also includes support from live-in professional staff and access to academic success programs that apartments cannot offer,” Cartwright said.If the university is more successful in attracting and retaining students in the residence halls, the owners of private student housing will probably seek to market their apartments to young professionals or others who want to live downtown, said Jerry Dowell, government affairs director for the Columbia Chamber of Commerce.“Obviously Mizzou is going to do what they need to do and the off-campus housing owners are going to do what they need to do as well,” Dowell said.rkeller@columbiatribune.com573-815-1709 The University of Missouri is cutting the cost of living and eating on campus as it tries to lure freshmen away from off-campus housing and convince more returning students to stay in dorms for a second year.

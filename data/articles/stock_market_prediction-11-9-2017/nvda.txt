Nvidia Corporation NVDA quickly became one of Wall Street’s most popular and prominent  tech stocks, resting in the tier just below giants like Intel INTC. The company also happens to be one of the last big-time brands to report its most recent quarterly earnings this season. The semiconductor powerhouse remains a top producer of graphics chips, which has helped its shares soar nearly 100% since the start of the year. Along with its core business, Nvidia has also ventured into more nascent economic sectors, including driverless vehicle technology and artificial intelligence. Now, before Nvidia is set to report its third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Thursday after the closing bell, it is time for investors to dive into some of the company’s projected financial outcomes. Nvidia’s Q3 earnings are projected to climb over 13% to 94 cents per share, based on our current consensus estimates. The company’s top line is expected to jump almost 18% year-over-year to hit $2.36 billion. Nvidia investors will also want to understand how the company is expected to perform in its individual business units. Thankfully, our exclusive non-financial metrics consensus estimate file can help investors break down some different segments. These key stock-driving estimates are updated daily and are based on the independent research of expert stock analysts. For more information on the NFM file, click here. Nvidia’s Datacenter unit is projected to see staggering growth, while we also expect its Automotive revenues to pop. But even with these substantial surges in growing and future-looking business segments, investors might want to focus on how the company really makes money. More than half of the semiconductor company’s revenues still come from its Gaming division. And the continued proliferation of video games, coupled with the rise of “esports”—or competitive video gaming—has only increased the demand for Nvidia’s high-powered graphics chips, which were already beloved by PC gamers around the globe. Therefore, investors should be excited to know that, based on our latest NFM consensus estimates, sales from Nvidia’s Gaming unit are projected to climb over 7% to hit $1.332 billion.

(NASDAQ: AMD) the jitters, is scheduled to report its fiscal third-quarter results after the market close on Thursday. See Benzinga's preview of the results here. Deutsche Bank's semiconductor analyst Ross Seymore previewed Nvidia's results. Deutsche Bank maintained its Hold rating Nvidia but raised its price target from $145 to $190, rolling forward its valuation on its upwardly revised earnings per share estimates. Nvidia is likely to report a solid Q3, with revenues estimated at $2.41 billion, according to Seymore. This compares to the company's guidance of $2.35 billion, and the consensus estimate of $2.37 billion. That said, recent strength in PCs and cryptocurrency could to lead to incremental upside, Seymore added. Among segments, Deutsche Bank expects gaming revenues, accounting for 57 percent of sales, to increase 16 percent sequentially, and data center, accounting for 19 percent of sales, to rise by 10 percent. The firm angles for sequentially flat auto revenues, a 5 percent drop in Proviz and a 17 percent decline in OEM/other revenues, which comprise crypto-related sales. Specifically, the firm expects crypto-related sales to plunge 42 percent sequentially. The firm models GAAP earnings per share of 97 cents, ahead of the consensus of 95 cents. To reflect better gaming revenues, Deutsche Bank raised its F4Q and 2019 estimates. At time of writing, Nvidia shares were down 1.76 percent at $208.30. The stock has nearly doubled in the year-to-date period, following up on its stellar run in 2016. Image Credit: yoggy0 from Yokohama, Japan (SIGGRAPH Asia 2009) [CC BY 2.0], via Wikimedia Commons

CBS Corporation (NYSE:CBS) trades at $57.61 having a market capitalization of $22.78 billion. CBS stock price lost -0.02% over the past year, yielding a negative weighted alpha of -6.2 percent. It should be noted that a moderate but negative weighted alpha indicates additional price decrease, though for not too long.  Weighted Alpha is used to calculate how much a share has gone up or down over a certain period, normally a year. In general, more thrust is placed on most recent actions by assigning higher weights to it than those assigned to past movements. This assists to give a return figure that has a stronger focus on the most current period and is thus a better measure for short-term analysis. This technique is highly famous among technical analysts. If the stock is up it will have a positively weighted alpha. If the stock price is unchanged its weighted alpha will be smaller. A stock price loss will yield a negatively weighted alpha.  Support is likely to come between $56.74 a share to $55.88 a share level. However, if the CBS shares go below $55.88 then it would indicate a much weaker market for the company. In that case, its shares would mark a 3% decline from the most recent price. The typical day in the last two weeks has seen about a 4.13% volatility. The average volume for CBS Corporation (NYSE:CBS) has been 3.87 million shares per day over the past 30 days. CBS has a 1-week performance of 2.66%. CBS price is down nearly -21.68% from its 52-week high price of $70.1 a share but is up about 8.44% from its 52-week low price of $52.75 a share.  NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has accumulated 2.66% over the course of one week. It seems that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) might see muted action given an ABR of 2.1 or Hold rating. Analysts, on average, seem bearish as they suggest NVDA is worth $-39.95 less, giving a target price of $172.08 a share. CBS share have plunged by -9.45% in percentage terms since the start of the year – and retreated -0.54% in the last month. Volume in the last session has decreased compared with CBS’s average trading volume. We think the decreased volume is representative of sellers as it has displayed in many other cases.  NVDA’s Stochastic Oscillator (%D) is at 90.41%. Values of %D line that are above 80 indicate that the security is overbought; prices could well fall in the near future. And the values below 20 that it is oversold indicate prices could very well bounce upwards. The Stochastic Oscillator is a powerful technical tool that is somewhat surprisingly easy to understand. In a basic sense, it is used by technicians to measure the speed or momentum of the price movement. It represents the location of the previous close relative to the price range over a set number of periods. This can be more easily understood, however, by pulling apart the two lines on the stochastic oscillator and explaining the simple underlying mathematical formulas. The first line is called the %K line, which analyzes the actual price movements in the shares and can be defined as: %K = (Current Close – Lowest Low)/(Highest High – Lowest Low) * 100. The second line, the %D line is simple a 3-day moving average of the %K line. There are three primary ways to read the Stochastic Oscillator in search of entry points, but traders should follow the %D line closely because that indicates major trends on the chart.  NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s latest quote $212.03 $0.65 1.14% will find technical support in $210.43 a share and a breakdown below this region would be a significantly bearish signal for NVIDIA Corporation traders. Any way you dice it, a dip below $208.82 a share would be very bad news for NVDA’s technical picture in the near-term. The $208.82 level represents at least another 1.51% downside for the stock from its current price. If NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares can stay above the price resistance around $213.27 a share, that could help propel NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) higher to the next line of resistance at $214.5 a share. The typical day in the last one month has seen about a 2.05% volatility. NVDA is down around 68.51% from its 12-month high of $66.76 notched on Nov 10, 2016 but is 133.06% above its highest point the past 12 months of $-70.1 a share.

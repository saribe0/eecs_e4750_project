Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) secured permission last month to construct a wholly-owned factory in Shanghai’s free trade zone, circumventing Chinese laws requiring foreign automakers to enter joint ventures with domestic partners. However, it was seen to remain subject to a 25-percent import tariff. Now, even that hurdle seems to be collapsing. Bernstein’s Toni Sacconaghi Jr. covers technology stocks including Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (NYSE: HPE). Bernstein reiterated a Market Perform rating on Tesla with a $265 price target. China’s regulations for electric vehicle manufacturers may further diminish, Vice President of Investor Relations Aaron Chew told Bernstein. “Tesla appears to believe that it may be able to produce cars in China for the country's domestic market without having to face import tariffs,” Sacconaghi wrote in a Wednesday note. Additionally, Chew forecasted steady capital expenditure through 2018 and suggested the company could develop $100-per-kiloWatt batteries by 2019, two years ahead of competitor expectations. Bernstein sees risk in the potential need for a 2018 capital raise and Model 3 execution. Tesla’s stock took a beating over the last week amid a bottom-line earnings miss, legislative proposals to eliminate the electric vehicle federal tax credit, and the firm’s mentioning in the Paradise Papers. At time of publication, Tesla was trading at $303.27, down 9 percent week-over-week.

https://investorplace.com/2017/11/tsla-stock-all-drama/

In the 2000 blockbuster movie Gladiator, the eponymous character Maximus looks to the bloodthirsty masses at the Coliseum and derisively asks: “Are you not entertained?” after a life-preserving victory. The crowd falls silent, realizing what they had become with a young, self-serving emperor setting the tone. What’s that got to do with Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)? It’s the same question I’ll pose (again) to current and would-be owners of TSLA stock: Are you not entertained by all the recent volatility-inducing drama? This is what you signed up for after all, right? The latest chapter in this sordid saga: The electric vehicle manufacturer’s Model 3 assembly line’s buildout is behind schedule, by about three months. It won’t be producing them at the once-touted pace of 5000 per month until the latter part of the first quarter of 2008, with the company’s own battery gigafactory cited as at least one of the reasons for the bottleneck. It’s not surprising, truth be told. In fact, what would have been surprising was Tesla being on schedule, considering CEO Elon Musk’s penchant and history for overpromising and underdelivering. The market was surprised nonetheless, however, with the TSLA stock price plunging 7% the day the bad news was released. The drama hardly ended there, however. Shortly thereafter, Tesla announced it would be acquiring one of its suppliers, Perbix, as a means of shoring up some of the challenges with the development of its assembly Model 3 line, and as a means of appeasing frustrated owners of TSLA stock. The deal wasn’t announced, however, until after investor lawsuits were planned. Apparently some investors (or at least some attorneys for investors) felt they were duped into taking Musk at his word despite a long string of previous delays and shortfalls. Were it any other company, the events of the past few days would be eye-popping. When it’s Tesla though, it’s par for the course. And it should change the way investors look at Tesla. I’ve said it numerous times before but it merits repeating now: If you’re thinking of Tesla as a conventional investment in game-changing technology a la Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) or Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB), think again. Next Page Article printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2017/11/tsla-stock-all-drama/. ©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC

					Posted by Sebastian Weber on Nov 9th, 2017 // No Comments  Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) had its price objective lowered by Evercore ISI  from $330.00 to $312.00 in a research report issued on Sunday, October 29th. The firm presently has an “outperform” rating on the electric vehicle producer’s stock. Evercore ISI’s price target would suggest a potential upside of 2.50% from the company’s previous close.  The analysts wrote, “important piece” of the bullish, but a cautious view is now warranted, Galliers wrote in the downgrade note. Specifically, it is clear that production of the Model 3 sedan in the third quarter was weaker than expected with 260 units produced as opposed to an original target of slightly more than 1,500 units.At this point, there is no indication of whether Tesla fixed whatever production issues it may have had. Investors may need to wait for clarity on the company’s third-quarter earnings report on Nov. 1, the analyst wrote. As a best-case scenario, Tesla’s management team would say that production of the Model 3 is an “S-Curve” and hasn’t changed substantially.However, a more likely scenario to play out would be Tesla’s management unable to have 100 percent visibility on the Model 3 ramp until it is able to produce more than one thousand cars a week — which is unlikely to happen until the end of November.”In the meantime, we urge caution on 3rd party interpretations of 20 second Instagram feeds from CEO Elon Musk,” Other equities research analysts also recently issued reports about the company. Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (The) upped their price objective on Tesla from $180.00 to $190.00 in a research report on Friday, August 4th.

Berenberg Bank  reissued a “buy” rating on shares of Tesla in a research note on Thursday, August 3rd. Finally, Argus raised Tesla from a “hold” rating to a “buy” rating and increased their target price for the company from $355.17 to $444.00 in a research report on Tuesday, August 8th.

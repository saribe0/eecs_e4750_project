After previously competing in four games for the regular season, the UAA hockey team made their conference debut last weekend, Nov. 3-4. UAA traveled to Michigan for back-to-back games against Lake Superior State. Prior to the weekend duel, both teams had a total of five loses for the season, with Lake Superior State only leading the Seawolves by one win. However, Lake Superior got a head start with their Western Collegiate Hockey Association games, with one more than UAA. Post-games, both the Seawolves and Lake Superior sit near the bottom of the standings of WCHA standings at eighth and seventh, respectively. At the top of the standings is Bowling Green State University, with three conference wins and one conference loss. Right behind them is Minnesota State and Northern Michigan. The Seawolves got off to an exceptionally slow start on Friday. The first period resulted in no points made by either team. It wasn’t until the last 30 seconds of the second period that UAA took over. Junior forward Nicolas Erb-Ekholm used a power play to score the first UAA goal of the night and his second goal of the season. Erb-Ekholm’s goal wouldn’t have been possible if it weren’t for Nathan and Jonah Renouf assisting the play. The Seawolves maintained their lead for the majority of the second period until Lake Superior’s Anthony Nellis scored at nearly 17 minutes in the second period, bringing the game to a tie. Not long after, a power-play goal took Lake Superior into the lead, early in the third period. UAA’s freshman defenseman Cameron Trott scored late in the third period, with the power-play score tying it up for the rest of the third. Lake Superior’s Max Humitz scored at 3:38 in the first overtime to overtake the Seawolves, and win the game 3-2. UAA came back Saturday to seek redemption. After the Game 1 loss, the Seawolves made a comeback with a win of 4-1. The start of the game resulted in senior forward Tad Kozun being the first to score for the night, barely a minute into the game. His goal served as a rebound from the attempted shot by junior forward Cam Amantea. Tanner Johnson also assisted on the goal. Similar to the first period of the Friday night game, the second period of Saturday’s game stood at a stand still, without either team making a point. It wasn’t until just two minutes into the third period that the Seawolves came back strong. Senior forward Austin Azurdia managed to get his first goal of the night that put UAA up 2-0, assisted by defensemen Eric Sinclair and goaltender Olivier Mantha. For another four minutes, the Seawolves kept their defense up and maintained the 2-0 lead. Six minutes later, Lake Superior’s Jake Hand managed a power play that put the game a 2-1. Quickly after, junior forward Jeremiah Luedtke and Kozun initiated a set-up for Azurdia to successfully make his second goal of the night. The Seawolves regained their two point lead, and had less than 10 minutes in the game. Luedtke still managed to put in one more goal before the end of the night to close out the game win with just two minutes remaining. The win couldn’t have happened without the 34 saves accumulated by senior goaltender Mantha. With one win and one loss for the weekend, the Seawolves currently sit at a tie for eighth in the conference. UAA hockey will be back in action on Nov. 10 and 11 with away games against Alabama-Huntsville. The following weekend the Seawolves will return home to the Sullivan arena to host back-to-back home games versus Michigan Tech.

Is the worst over for Under Armour Inc (NASDAQ: UAA)? After seeing shares drop 29 percent post-earnings, expectations may now be so low that the company can now hit the reset button. The downside is now limited on Under Armour, but the company must protect their house better, Susquehanna analyst Sam Poser said in a Tuesday note. “The street is already bracing for poor results for the foreseeable future. Further, we believe UAA is becoming more cognizant of its recent mistakes,” Poser said. (See Poser's track record here.)  Susquehanna upgraded Under Armour from Negative to Neutral and raised its price target from $11 to $15. Under Armour is committed to returning to the pull model, with more demand and less inventory in the market, but Poser said he's not convinced that the retailer's distribution model will allow it to grow as an affordable luxury brand, given its current presence in discount retailers. “We believe that distribution to retailers such as Kohl’s, DSW and Famous Footwear must cease quickly in order to rebuild an affordable luxury brand with a pull model. Unfortunately, UAA appears focused on short-term growth over taking the painful but appropriate steps to make Under Armour a strong brand for the long-term,” Poser said.  Despite the upgrade, the Susquehanna analyst said Under Armour is in trouble in North America, and that the company must do an extraordinary amount of work to restore brand sentiment. Creating a compelling lifestyle business, albeit challenging in the current environment, will be an important factor in turning things around for Under Armour, Poser said.  Related Links:  Air Force 1: The Shoe That Defined Sneaker Culture Celebrates Its 35th Anniversary These Non-Tech Companies Are Investing In An AI Future   Photo courtesy of Under Armour.

 The nation's 12th-ranked Division I women's basketball team clobbered the nation's fourth-ranked Division II team Sunday, but the Duke Blue Devils couldn't stop UAA's Hannah Wandersee.  A 6-foot-1 junior from Kodiak, Wandersee had the best game of her college career in UAA's 87-56 exhibition loss at Cameron Indoor Stadium in Durham, North Carolina.  She put up the second double-double of her career — 19 point and 10 rebounds — and blocked four shots.  "We have been waiting for a breakout game from her like this," UAA coach Ryan McCarthy said in a press release from UAA. "(W)e just didn't realize it would come against Duke at Cameron Indoor Stadium."  Wandersee connected on 9 of 16 shots from the field and added two steals to lead the Seawolves, who got in trouble early.  Duke raced to a 10-0 lead, a burst that began with a wide-open 3-pointer by Lexie Brown, a two-time All-America guard. A 5-9 senior, Brown poured in 27 points on 10-of-17 shooting, with many of her points coming in transition.  Duke's speed and size proved fatal to the Seawolves, who surrendered 20 fast-break points and were outrebounded 48-34.  UAA responded to Duke's fast start with a 3-pointer by Shelby Cloninger and a jumper by Sydni Stallworth to make it 10-5, but the Blue Devils led 26-13 at the end of the first quarter and 49-28 at the half.  "This was a tremendous opportunity for us to test ourselves against incredible athletes at the highest level of our sport," McCarthy said. "I'm really proud of the effort our ladies showed today – they did not back down an inch. Hannah's effort was especially impressive."  Wandersee's only other double-double came in her freshman season when she posted 22 points and 11 rebounds against New Hope Christian, an Oregon school that belongs to the National Christian College Athletic Association.  Cloninger hit three of her six shots behind the arc to finish with 11 points for the Seawolves, who also got five points, four rebounds, four assists and two steals from Rodericka Ware.  Rebecca Greenwell, Brown's backcourt mate, dropped in 20 points to go with seven rebounds, six assists and five steals for the Blue Devils.  The Seawolves play their first games against Division II opponents this week at the Wildcat Crossover Tournament in Ellensburg, Washington. UAA faces Hawaii Pacific at 11 a.m. AST Friday and Cal State Los Angeles at noon AST Saturday.

Wednesday night, the Washington University women’s volleyball team had dinner with former Bears head coach Teri Clemens. Just a week earlier, Wash. U. had been one of the hottest teams in Division III, having won 10 straight contests. But the Red and Green had lived up to their name: The tides turned quickly when a loss to DePauw University not only ended the streak, but leaked into three straight losses. Sophomore Lauren Fournier digs the ball in the bears’ 3-0 win against Transylvania in October. Bears volleyball defeated Emory on Saturday with a 3-1 victory, and will play at the NCAA selection show on November 6th. With the UAA Championships right around the corner, the Bears needed to get their act together. A win against Greenville University helped, but it was meeting with Clemens, who served 14 years at the helm, totaling seven national championships and a 136-1 conference record, that sparked their best weekend of the year. “She really got us fired up,” sophomore setter Chloe Stile said. “She told us that we could crush everyone in the UAA and that’s what she expected of us. But it also didn’t matter what the scoreboard said but how we felt after the game and knowing that we gave it our all. I think that really inspired a lot of us.” Current head coach Vanessa Walby saw the same effects. “I think spending time with Teri was helpful,” Walby said. “I think the underclassmen are still trying to learn the history and traditions that is Bear volleyball. Seeing it firsthand for all of the girls was very special. Teri built what we have here and it is special and awesome to be a part of.” The Bears proceeded to sweep the UAA Championships, with commanding wins over New York University, No. 20 University of Chicago and No. 7 Emory University to clinch their 22nd conference title this weekend in the Woodruff P.E. Center in Atlanta. During the three-game losing streak, the team’s cohesion wasn’t the same as it had been during most of the regular season. After meeting with Clemens and defeating Greenville, the team made adjustments—but they weren’t tactical changes, according to Stile. “A lot of it was that we really came together as a team over the weekend,” Stile said. “During those three games at the end of the season, we were playing more like individuals…It was mostly mental; it wasn’t so much physical adjustments.” Walby saw the same effects, citing that the team “regrouped” as everyone was given a “clean slate” after the three games heading into the UAA conference tournament. The team set the tone with a 3-0 beatdown of NYU in its opening match. After winning the first set 25-13, the Bears held on for a tight 25-21 victory in the second set. Demoralized, New York’s energy was zapped and the Bears took advantage, closing with a powerful 25-9 set to complete the sweep. Wash. U. finished with 47 kills to NYU’s 29, while posting a hitting percentage of 38. Junior middle hitter Julianne Malek and freshman outside hitter Tricia Brown tied for a team-high 10 kills, while freshman setter Kirby Knapp had a team-high 24 assists and sophomore defensive specialist Zoe Baxter totaled a team-high 12 digs. The Bears fed off that momentum to knock off Chicago in three sets. Once again, the Bears totaled more kills, hitting 50 to Chicago’s 37. It was junior outside hitter Ifeoma Ufondu who led the way, notching 20 kills, tying her highest mark all year, on a 41 hitting percentage. Stile had a team-high 22 assists while Baxter and the team’s lone senior, defensive specialist Lauren Fournier, had a team-high 13 digs. Once again, Wash. U. found itself in the championship match with Emory. Historically, that’s par for the course—11 of the last 14 times and the six most recent times the Red and Green have seized the UAA title, it’s been against the Eagles. The Bears fought to win a tight 25-23 first set, but lost their first set of the weekend, 25-17, in the next. The Bears showed resiliency, winning back-to-back sets 25-16 and 25-17, respectively, to close the deal and capture the title. Malek again led the team in kills with 14 and a hitting percentage of 54. Knapp totaled 20 assists while Baxter had 21 digs. “I would prefer to say as a team it was a great team weekend,” Walby said. “That was our emphasis.” The Bears now have a guaranteed spot in the NCAA Tournament, but will have to wait until Monday’s Selection Show to see where they’re placed. They will have a viewing show as a team when the results come out at 11:30 a.m. “I am really excited that we have the automatic qualifier,” Walby said. “That takes a lot of stress off. Now we wait to see if we host or are traveling.” The Bears will try to replicate their run last year and make it back to the NCAA Championship, channeling a little Teri Clemens, just as they did this weekend.

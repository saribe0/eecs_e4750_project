 Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT), like many other retailers, thinks that Black Friday really begins Thanksgiving evening, after the family dinner and nap. The company plans to open stores at 6 p.m. local time, but online shoppers can take advantage of Black Friday pricing beginning at 12:01 a.m. Thanksgiving morning. The company also has a deal for shoppers who can’t wait another two weeks. Walmart is offering a four-day pre-Black Friday sale that began at midnight this Thursday morning and runs through Sunday November 12. Walmart’s 32-page Black Friday advertising supplement is now available as a scanned image at BFAds.net, as is the advertising supplement for the current four-day sale. In an email, Brent Shelton of BFAds noted that for the first time in a long time, there is no mention of Walmart’s infamous 1-Hour Guarantee. And details on which items will be available online are also scarce. Here are some items of note from the Black Friday sale: And if you can’t wait, here are a couple of items available this weekend: View the Black Friday supplement and the weekend supplement at BFAds.net.

Walmart (wmt) has made the first of its Black Friday style deals available to shoppers online as the race to win the holiday season starts to intensify. The world’s largest retailer, looking for a repeat of its strong 2016 holiday season when it bested rivals like Target (tgt), is offering a few deals on items such an Acer Aspire ES Laptop and the Xbox One S Console Bundle from Thursday through November 12, in the hopes of whetting shoppers’ appetites for the Black Friday shopping bonanza. A full list of Walmart’s Black Friday deals that will only be available on Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday itself is available here. Other retailers including Kohl’s (kss) and Amazon.com (amzn) have also begun giving shoppers a foretaste of the deals to be had starting on Thanksgiving Day. (Many such deals, include Walmart’s, will be available online all day on Nov. 23 but only in stores later on Turkey Day. In the case of Walmart, the deals will be in-store starting at 6 p.m., as was the case last year.) On Wednesday, Best Buy also announced an early start to its Black Friday deals. Last week, Walmart announced its overall holiday season strategy, which includes holding thousands of parties in its stores. While the National Retail Federation has forecast a strong holiday season for the industry as a whole, it’s clear that the Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday period is only getting more competitive, what with Walmart and Amazon.com (amzn) promising low prices and retailers falling over themselves to offer faster delivery and unique items. The earlier deals may blunt the overall impact of sales on Black Friday itself—as they have in recent years—but retailers are taking a season-wide look at their strategy since so much shopping has been brought earlier into the Christmas period. The months of November and December can generate 30% of annual sales for many retailers. But beyond that, a successful Black Friday period is key to getting shoppers into the habit of choosing one retailer rather than another. Even though Walmart has made a point to reduce the amount of inventory it carries in stores—increasing efficiency and avoiding a surfeit of unsold merchandise—the retailer says it will be fully stocked for the Black Friday shopping bonanza, lest it miss out unnecessarily on some business. “Customers also want to ensure that when they venture out on Black Friday, they can find the deal that they’re after. The items need to be available in the stores,” Steve Bratspies, chief merchant for Walmart U.S. told reporters on a conference call.

Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Dollar Tree, Inc. (NYSE:DLTR) are both Services companies that recently hit new low. This price action has ruffled more than a few feathers in the investment community, but is one a better investment than the other? To answer this, we will compare the two companies across growth, profitability, risk, return, dividends, and valuation measures. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) operates in the Discount, Variety Stores segment of the Services sector. The company has grown sales at a 1.70% annual rate over the past five years, putting it in the low growth category. WMT has a net profit margin of 2.60% and is more profitable than the average company in the Discount, Variety Stores industry. In terms of efficiency, WMT has an asset turnover ratio of 2.43. This figure represents the amount of revenue a company generates per dollar of assets. WMT’s financial leverage ratio is 1.58, which indicates that the company’s asset base is primarily funded by equity capital. Company’s return on equity, which is really just the product of the company’s profit margin, asset turnover, and financial leverage ratios, is 16.70%, which is better than the Discount, Variety Stores industry average ROE. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) pays out an annual dividend of 2.04 per share. At the current valuation, this equates to a dividend yield of 2.30%. The company has a payout ratio of 48.40%. WMT’s current dividend therefore should be sustainable. Stock’s free cash flow yield, which represents the amount of cash available to investors before dividends, expressed as a percentage of the stock price, is 0.74. All else equal, companies with higher FCF yields are viewed as cheaper. Company trades at a P/E ratio of 21.34, and is less expensive than the average stock in the Discount, Variety Stores industry. The average investment recommendation for WMT, taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts, is 2.40, or a buy. Over the past three months, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. insiders have been net buyers, dumping a net of -51,666,834 shares. This implies that insiders have been feeling relatively bearish about the outlook for WMT. Insider activity and sentiment signals are important to monitor because they can shed light on how “risky” a stock is perceived to be at it’s current valuation. Knowing this, it makes sense to look at beta, a measure of market risk. WMT has a beta of 0.34 and therefore an below average level of market volatility.

So this week we highlight one interesting put contract, and one interesting call contract, from the November expiration for WMT. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting, is at the $87 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of 77 cents. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 0.9% return against the $87 commitment, or a 29.4% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost ).      Turning to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the November expiration, for shareholders of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (Symbol: WMT) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 2.3% annualized dividend yield. Selling the covered call at the $91 strike and collecting the premium based on the 85 cents bid, annualizes to an additional 31.6% rate of return against the current stock price (this is what we at Stock Options Channel refer to as the YieldBoost ), for a total of 33.9% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $91 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but WMT shares would have to advance 2.1% from current levels for that to happen, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 3% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.

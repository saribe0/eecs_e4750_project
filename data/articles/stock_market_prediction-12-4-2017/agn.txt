Allergan plc Ordinary Shares (NYSE: AGN) have seen heavy selling pressure throughout parts of 2017, but some analysts are encouraging investors to take advantage of the weakness. Morgan Stanley's David Risinger upgraded Allergan's stock rating from Equal-weight to Overweight with an unchanged $200 price target. Allergen's stock has come under heavy selling pressure since July for four reasons, Risinger said: At this point in time, Allergan's negative overhangs are now mostly priced in, the analyst said. (See Risinger's track record here.)  For example, a potential competitor to Botox, Revance Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ: RVNC), is unlikely to report Phase 3 data in the coming days that its RT002 is materially longer-lasting than Botox, the analyst said. Aside from Botox, expectations are that Allergan's depression therapy rapastinel will improve with the conclusion of three Phase 3 studies projected at the end of 2018, while Phase 2 data indicates the therapy could be a blockbuster, according to Morgan Stanley.  Risinger's $200 price target is based on an 11.7x multiple on the analyst's 2018 EV/EBITDA of 11.7x, which implies a slight discount to its major pharmaceutical peers at 12.0x. Shares of Allergan hit a new 52-week low of $168.43 on Tuesday but were trading higher by more than 2 percent early Wednesday morning.

 Large-cap companies such as Allergan plc (NYSE:AGN), with a market-capitalization of USD $57.71B, are much sought after by risk-averse investors who find diversified revenue streams and strong capital returns more comforting than explosive growth potential. But another key factor to consider when investing in AGN is its financial health. Why is it important? A major downturn in the energy industry has resulted in over 150 companies going bankrupt and has put more than 100 on the verge of a collapse, primarily due to excessive debt. These factors make a basic understanding of a company’s financial position of utmost importance for a new investor. Here are a few basic checks that are good enough to have a broad overview of the company’s financial strength. View our latest analysis for Allergan   Is AGN’s level of debt at an acceptable level?  Debt-to-equity ratio standards differ between industries, as some some are more capital-intensive than others, meaning they need more capital to carry out core operations. Generally, large-cap stocks are considered financially healthy if its ratio is below 40%. AGN’s debt-to-equity ratio stands at 42.62%, which indicates that its debt can cause trouble for the company in a downturn but it is still at a manageable level.        NYSE:AGN Historical Debt Nov 28th 17  A simple way to determine whether the company has put debt into good use is to look at its operating cash flow against its debt obligation. This also assesses AGN’s debt repayment capacity, which is not a big concern for a large company. Last year, AGN’s operating cash flow was 0.12x its current debt. A ratio of over 0.1x shows that AGN is generating adequate cash from its core business, which should increase its potential to pay back near-term debt.   Are you a shareholder? AGN’s cash flow coverage indicates it could improve its operating efficiency in order to meet demand for debt repayments should unforeseen events arise. Given that AGN’s financial position could change over time, You should continue assessing market expectations for AGN’s future growth on our free analysis platform.   Are you a potential investor? While investors should analyse the serviceability of debt, it shouldn’t be viewed in isolation of other factors. After all, debt financing is an important source of funding for companies seeking to grow through new projects and investments. As for next steps, I encourage potential investors to look at AGN’s Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) in order to see management’s track record at deploying funds in high-returning projects.

In terms of relative volume, these shares are trading at 1.07x their normal volume.

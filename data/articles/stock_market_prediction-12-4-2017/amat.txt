Applied Materials (AMAT) is trading sharply lower today, so we looked back at what we wrote two weeks ago. At that juncture in the market, we said, "AMAT might close lower today after making a new high of $60.89. This might turn out to be a key reversal day, but it probably will not be the end of the bull story as the charts do not show a distribution or topping pattern. I would look for AMAT to trade sideways for a number of weeks." With some hindsight, we can see the high at $60.89 on Nov. 17 has remained the high. Today AMAT is trading below its nearby support level at $55. Normally the breaking of a nearby support level is not that crucial in as strong a bull market as we have been witnessing, but AMAT is also trading below its 50-day moving average line. AMAT traded below that line for much of August, but the rest of our favorite indicators were in better shape at that point in time.   In this updated daily bar chart, above, we can see AMAT is below the rising 50-day line and the next likely area of support (previous area of resistance) is the $48-$47 area -- the highs of June, July and September. The rising 200-day moving average line is still well below the market, around $45. In the past six weeks or so, the On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has been flat, telling us that buyers and sellers of AMAT were in balance. The price weakness today could mean the OBV line turns down. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator crossed to the downside in late October, generating a take-profits sell signal. The MACD oscillator is still pointed down in a bearish mode.   In this weekly bar chart of AMAT, above, only one indicator has deteriorated in the past two weeks. Prices are still above the rising 40-week moving average line. The weekly OBV line is still constructive. The MACD oscillator, however, has narrowed. In the next few weeks we may or may not see a bearish crossover of the two moving averages that comprise this indicator, but the histogram (the distance between the two averages) has already peaked.   In this Point and Figure chart of AMAT, above, we can see a column of O's to the downside. Prices have met a downside price target of $53.82, but we don't have a lot of reason to anticipate support nearby. The best area for support is in the mid-$40s, where there is heavy volume (the left side of the chart). Bottom line: Selloffs in the "hot" technology sector in the bull market this year have been relatively short and shallow, but the advance is older now than it was in January, so aging has to be considered. Keeping this in mind, we might be seeing the start of a pullback to the $47 area and a new consolidation pattern in the weeks ahead. Keep your powder dry.

Now trading with a market value of 61.40B, the company has a mix of catalysts and obstacles that spring from the nature of its operations. Everyone seems to have their own opinion of this stock. But what do the numbers really say? We think it’s a great time to take a fresh look. Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) Fundamentals That Matter It’s generally a good idea to start with the most fundamental piece of the picture: the balance sheet. The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base.

(NASDAQ:AMAT) Revenue Growth Potential As far as key trends that demonstrate something of the future investment potential of this stock, we need to take a closer look at the top line, first and foremost.

But what about the bottom line? After all, that’s what really matters in the end. Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT) is intriguing when broken down to its core data.

For shareholders, given the total diluted outstanding shares of 1.08 billion, this means overall earnings per share of 0.91.

https://stocknewsgazette.com/2017/11/27/critical-comparison-applied-materials-inc-amat-vs-oclaro-inc-oclr/

Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) shares are up more than 79.45% this year and recently increased 0.40% or $0.23 to settle at $57.91. Oclaro, Inc. (NASDAQ:OCLR), on the other hand, is down -21.28% year to date as of 11/24/2017. It currently trades at $7.05 and has returned 10.77% during the past week. Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) and Oclaro, Inc. (NASDAQ:OCLR) are the two most active stocks in the Semiconductor Equipment & Materials industry based on today’s trading volumes. Investors are clearly interested in the two names, but is one a better choice than the other? We will compare the two companies across growth, profitability, risk, valuation, and insider trends to answer this question. Growth One of the key things investors look for in a company is the ability to grow earnings at a high compound rate over time. Analysts expect AMAT to grow earnings at a 16.82% annual rate over the next 5 years. Comparatively, OCLR is expected to grow at a 14.00% annual rate. All else equal, AMAT’s higher growth rate would imply a greater potential for capital appreciation. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Profitability and Returns Growth doesn’t mean much if it comes at the cost of weak profitability. To adjust for differences in capital structure we’ll use EBITDA margin and Return on Investment (ROI) as measures of profitability and return. , compared to an EBITDA margin of 25.14% for Oclaro, Inc. (OCLR). AMAT’s ROI is 24.40% while OCLR has a ROI of 27.80%. The interpretation is that OCLR’s business generates a higher return on investment than AMAT’s. Cash Flow  
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 If there’s one thing investors care more about than earnings, it’s cash flow. AMAT’s free cash flow (“FCF”) per share for the trailing twelve months was +0.43. Comparatively, OCLR’s free cash flow per share was +0.15. On a percent-of-sales basis, AMAT’s free cash flow was 3.15% while OCLR converted 0% of its revenues into cash flow. This means that, for a given level of sales, AMAT is able to generate more free cash flow for investors. Liquidity and Financial Risk Balance sheet risk is one of the biggest factors to consider before investing. AMAT has a current ratio of 2.90 compared to 3.90 for OCLR. This means that OCLR can more easily cover its most immediate liabilities over the next twelve months. AMAT’s debt-to-equity ratio is 0.61 versus a D/E of 0.01 for OCLR. AMAT is therefore the more solvent of the two companies, and has lower financial risk. Valuation AMAT trades at a forward P/E of 13.18, a P/B of 7.11, and a P/S of 4.27, compared to a forward P/E of 11.16, a P/B of 2.18, and a P/S of 1.94 for OCLR. AMAT is the expensive of the two stocks on an earnings, book value and sales basis. Given that earnings are what matter most to investors, analysts tend to place a greater weight on the P/E. Analyst Price Targets and Opinions Just because a stock is cheaper doesn’t mean there’s more value to be had. In order to assess value we need to compare the current price to where it’s likely to trade in the future. AMAT is currently priced at a -15.14% to its one-year price target of 68.24. Comparatively, OCLR is -26.41% relative to its price target of 9.58. This suggests that OCLR is the better investment over the next year. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 1.80 for AMAT and 1.80 for OCLR, which implies that analysts are equally bullish on their outlook for the two stocks. Risk and Volatility Beta is an important measure that gives investors a sense of the market risk associated with a particular stock. A beta above 1 signals above average market risk, while a beta below 1 implies below average volatility. AMAT has a beta of 1.84 and OCLR’s beta is 1.39. OCLR’s shares are therefore the less volatile of the two stocks. Insider Activity and Investor Sentiment Comparing the number of shares sold short to the float is a method analysts often use to get a reading on investor sentiment. AMAT has a short ratio of 1.05 compared to a short interest of 6.91 for OCLR. This implies that the market is currently less bearish on the outlook for AMAT. Summary Oclaro, Inc. (NASDAQ:OCLR) beats Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) on a total of 8 of the 14 factors compared between the two stocks. OCLR is growing fastly, higher liquidity and has lower financial risk. In terms of valuation, OCLR is the cheaper of the two stocks on an earnings, book value and sales basis, OCLR is more undervalued relative to its price target. Finally, KLAC has better sentiment signals based on short interest.

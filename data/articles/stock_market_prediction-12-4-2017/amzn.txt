 AMZN GOOGL AAPL MSFT  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report)	 can no longer be identified as just a retail giant. Always aiming to innovate, the company now plans to explore the new territory of prescription drugs. Reportedly, the e-commerce giant is trying to figure out a way to break into the multi-billion-dollar healthcare industry. Let’s take a look at what Amazon has been doing to enter this space. Coming to the share price, Amazon has underperformed the industry it belongs to on a year-to-date basis. The company’s shares have gained only 55% compared with the industry’s growth of 58.1%.  What Is Amazon Doing? Citing sources, CNBC reports that Amazon has already been in talks with pharmaceutical company Mylan and the Sandoz division of Novartis. Both these produce a wide range of generic drugs. In May, CNBC had reported that the company would be hiring a business lead to assist in this process, and is preparing to enter the pharmacy market, especially since the broader healthcare market could undergo serious change soon. Soon news spread that Amazon had acquired pharmacy licenses in a dozen states. Although the company at that time had said that it did so to sell medical supplies, this definitely does also enable Amazon to sell drugs down the line, if it wishes to. According to an analysis by Adam Fein, president of Pembroke Consulting, selling prescription drugs is a big business in the United States given that the retail pharmacy is a $400 billion industry. Therefore, if Amazon succeeds in penetrating the market, it is sure to benefit and give other pharmaceutical companies stiff competition. Bottom Line Amazon has already created ripples in a number of industries, namely book buying, retail shopping, groceries and Hollywood, using fierce customer loyalty and enormous reach. Its cloud business, Amazon Web Services, has been a key growth driver in recent times. Now, the fight for healthcare technology dollars is on and Amazon along with other tech biggies like Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report)	, Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report)	 and Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report)	 has targeted it in its own way. Talking about Amazon, the company already sells medical supplies and equipment like blood pressure monitors, braces, hearing aids, and even walkers and wheelchairs in the United States. Entering the pharmacy industry does seem like a natural and lucrative next step for the company. However, it’s remains unclear if Amazon would sell drugs to consumers or just act as a drug wholesaler. That said, it is for sure that even if Amazon enters this market, tasting success would not be that easy. The company might face major challenges related to government regulations and patient privacy requirements, which differ from typical retail. Therefore, the e-commerce giant might need to device some serious strategies in order to foray into this industry and then stay there for long. The company might also need to acquire smaller established brands in this space. It could also partner with insurers or employers to give their customers a better deal. Amazon has a long way to go. For now, we need to wait and watch how it plays its cards. Zacks Rank Amazon currently carries at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

 Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that AMZN may be headed in the future. To do this, analysts often study the speed and magnitude of a stock’s price movements with what are known as momentum indicators. The logic is that as a stock’s momentum slows, it may be nearing key support or resistance levels and possibly the end of a current trend. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for AMZN is 65.40%, which suggests that the stock is not particularly expensive or cheap, and not predisposed to a reactive price movement based on this measure. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 76.42%, tells a different story, and suggests that AMZN currently trades in overbought territory. What do the trading volumes reveal? Volume patterns are useful for gauging the level of conviction behind price changes, and can be used to make predictions about future price movements. A sudden increase in a stock’s activity can be a sign that investors are trading in anticipation of a catalyst, or that investors feel very strongly in one way or the other about the future direction of a stock. Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) average trading volume of 3,632,665 during the past month is 2.94% above its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been more active than usual in the stock in recent times. What do the analysts think? AMZN is currently undervalued by -5.38% relative to the average 1-year price target of $1227.32 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 1.80, which implies that analysts are generally bullish in their outlook for AMZN over the next year. How risky is the stock?  No study on the valuation of a stock is complete without taking into account risk. When analyzing the systematic risk associated with a stock, analysts look at beta, which measures the stock’s volatility relative to the overall market. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has a beta of 1.47, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are more extreme than the market as a whole. AMZN therefore has a above average level of market risk. During the past couple of weeks, AMZN average daily volatility was 19.31%, which is 7.41 percentage points lower than the average volatility over the past 100 days.

Source: Shutterstock Shares of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) are finally starting to level off after a monster rally. AMZN is up nearly 25% over the past month and 60% year-to-date. While Cyber Monday sales were assuredly impressive, I think the stock has come a little too far, too fast and is due for a consolidation period. Certainly any discussion regarding valuations with Amazon are meaningless. A current price-to-earnings ratio exceeding 300 is all you really need to know about it, especially given that Amazon is approaching $600 billion in market cap. Factor in a price-to-sales ratio now north of 3 and you can certainly make a case that AMZN shares are priced rather richly. InvestorPlace contributor Will Healy takes a deeper look at some of these valuation concerns in his insightful article from last week. Momentum and faith stocks such as Amazon stock trade on technicals, not fundamentals, anyways. Yesterday was a reversal day as AMZN stock opened higher (and at new highs) only to reverse course and close lower, near the lows of the day. This type of price action is many times indicative of a short-term top in a stock, especially following such a strong rally. 
Click to Enlarge AMZN is also overbought on a nine day RSI basis with a reading over 70. Previous instances when the nine-day RSI reached such extremes marked significant short-term highs in Amazon stock. The 20 day Detrended Price Oscillator is the most overbought by far over the past year. AMZN is also trading at a huge premium to the 50-day moving average, which is yet another sign of over exuberance. Option prices are still somewhat expensive with implied volatility (IV) in the 63rd percentile making option selling strategies still viable. To position for a short-term stall out, an out of the money call credit spread makes sense. Buy AMZN Dec $1240 calls and sell AMZN Dec $1230 calls for a $1.75 net credit Maximum gain on the trade is $175-per-spread and maximum risk is $825-per-spread. Return on risk is 21.21%. The short $1230 strike is positioned above the all-time intra-day high of $1213.41 for AMZN stock. As of this writing, Tim Biggam did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

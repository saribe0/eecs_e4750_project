https://amigobulls.com/articles/81470-massive-investments-will-drive-alibaba-stock-higher

Recently China-based eCommerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA) announced a bond issuance of $7.5 billion. This comes on the back of $5 billion syndicated loan the company had secured from 13 banks in May. This is despite the fact that Alibaba generates billions of dollars in free cash flows every year. So why this borrowing? Alibaba is trying to keep the growth engine running by expanding into various geographic and product markets. The company is expecting the strong revenue growth to continue driving BABA stock higher. Alibaba stock is already up around 100% driven by very strong quarterly performance.  Alibaba has been investing heavily over the years. Last year alone, the Chinese eCommerce powerhouse reported an outflow of more than $11 billion from investment activities. And the trend is likely to continue. Alibaba recently announced that it is buying more than 75% stake in the Sun Art Retail Group, one of the largest Chinese supermarket chain, by investing $2.9 billion. This strategic purchase is Alibaba's largest investment in the offline retail market and will help Alibaba's offline strategy. The company will also benefit from synergies if data, supply chain and purchases can be fully integrated. Like most other retail stores, Alibaba is increasingly pursuing an omnichannel strategy to conquer a bigger chunk of the retail market, as well as benefit from the synergies of online and offline presence. Alibaba is already constructing its first brick and mortar store. Amazon is also following a similar strategy. Offline is one of the largest growth areas for Alibaba. Offline makes up 85% or $4.25 trillion of the $5 trillion Chinese retail market. Apart from the recent investment, Alibaba is also converting 10,000 mom-and-pop convenience stores across China into a vast network of Tmall.com brick-and-mortar outlets, where consumers can shop, pick up packages, make orders online or even apply for and receive small loans. Alibaba has recently announced $15 billion in tech research and development over the next three years. The investment will be through a program called Alibaba DAMO Academy which will seek to increase collaboration in the fields of data intelligence, Internet of Things, Fintech, quantum computing and human-machine interaction. Alibaba is betting on these fields to become important growth engine in future. Alibaba Group has also planned another investment worth of $15 billion in its logistics firm Cainiao Smart Logistics Network over the next five year period. Earlier the company had raised its stake in Cainiao from 47% to 51% by investing $800 million. Cainiao is a fast growing loss-making data and software business. In the last couple of years, its revenue grew by tenfold. And Alibaba is betting on the growth in the company to continue and help in Alibaba's overseas expansion. Cainiao has been one of the key factors behind Alibaba Group's success by smoothing out friction on the logistics front. Cainiao's Data Intelligent Network was built to utilize data and technology to coordinate resources across a vast supply chain. These investments are expected to enhance the overall logistics experience for consumers and merchants across the Alibaba ecosystem, as well as lower costs through greater efficiencies. Alibaba plans on fulfilling orders in China within 24 hours and within 72 hours anywhere in the world. "Our commitment to Cainiao and additional investment in logistics demonstrate Alibaba’s commitment to building the most-efficient logistic network in China and around the world," Alibaba CEO Daniel Zhang said in a statement.  Alibaba has also invested heavily in other geographies like south-east Asia and India. It had topped its investment in the Lazda group by another $1 billion a few months ago. Alibaba had invested $1 billion in Lazda group last year. Alibaba also made a $100 million investment in Bigbasket, the biggest online grocery player in India and several hundred million dollars in Paytm mall which emerged as India's third largest eCommerce platform during the recently concluded festive season sale. Overall, Alibaba has a strong plan for driving future growth. After rallying by over 115% this year, Alibaba stock has declined in the past week or so. Alibaba stock is down over 8% in the last one week. This is despite the company reporting record sales during the Singles Day event. Alibaba's annual one-day shopping extravaganza produced a 39% rise in gross merchandise volume. One of the major reason for this decline was the sell-off in the tech stocks globally. Last Wednesday alone, the Nasdaq 100 Index fell as much as 2.2 percent while every stock in S&P 500 Semiconductor Index declined. Alibaba technical charts are flashing some strong bearish signals after the correction. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator crossed below the signal line and is about to make a bearish crossover with the center line indicating that bearish momentum could continue. BABA stock also breached the support from its 50-day moving average line. As can be seen in the technical chart, 50-day moving average has provided strong support for Alibaba stock throughout the year. The next support is from the 100-day SMA which is 4 handles lower. Last time Alibaba stock closed below 100-day SMA was in January this year.  Looking for fundamentally strong tech stocks?

  A FICTIONAL Mr Baba lolls on an Ottoman carpet on the back of the menu at Baba, the new restaurant on Edinburgh’s premier artery, George Street. He embodies those cultural representations of "the East", the "othering" dubbed as "Orientalism" by that great Palestinian academic, Edward Said. He didn’t mince his words. "Since the time of Homer every European, in what he could say about the Orient, was a racist, an imperialist, and almost totally ethnocentric," he wrote.
 
  If Said were with us today, I wonder what he would make of our ongoing love affair with Levantine cuisine. A modern expression of Orientalism, or evidence of a more enlightened appreciation of the intricacies of Middle Eastern cultures?
 
  In contemporary terms, Baba seems somewhat out of place in a quasi-autonomous part of the Principal Hotel (formerly the staid, dowager duchess that was the Roxburghe). It’s certainly a huge improvement of what preceded it, and it’s wonderful to see an independent business set up on this high-rent street, which, with the glowing exception of Caffè Contini, is overrun by chains. It’s encouraging too that Baba has a connection with the highly successful Ox And Finch team in Glasgow.
 
  My initial thought on Baba is that someone needs to get a grip of the front of house. It feels as if the waiting staff flit by, intently focused on everyone else’s needs. We want to order, but the woman who greeted us has disappeared. And when the food arrives (too promptly), we have to grab cutlery from the next table, our candle has gone out, and the Anatolian wine brought to us is white, even though we ordered rosé.
 
  It’s a short menu, so almost inevitably you’re going to go for the selection of eight dips that costs £17 for two people. Given that many of the ingredients – pulses, vegetables – are relatively inexpensive, and the flatbread is bought in, not made in-house, this seems quite a hefty price tag, even for George Street. And when the dishes all arrive, I check that this is indeed a serving for two, not one. Several amount to the equivalent of a heaped tablespoon.
 
  Fortunately, we’ve also ordered haggis and harissa kibbeh. Four tiny ones appear, more like Panko-crumbed haggis balls ramped up with chilli, but they’re eminently edible, especially with their minty dressing and dusting of nutty, salty, sesame seed dukkah.
 
  What little there is of the hummus is much better than average, largely because it’s not stingy with the tahini, it’s drizzled with zhug (the Yemeni pounded green sauce with coriander, parsley, and chilli), and strewn with toasted pine kernels. It beats the squash dip: it’s gummy, and gung-ho with the chilli. Same goes for the muhummara: too hot.
 
  The best of the dips is the goat cheese, pistachio, lemon, and courgette one. It reminds me of a recipe from Sabrina Ghayour’s useful book, Persiana. Potentially insipid beetroot hummus is saved from obscurity by its hazelnut dukkah. Labneh seems homemade and with enough fresh dill to please an Iranian. The only shortcoming of the mealy butter beans mashed up with green tahini and smoky baba ganoush is that there isn’t quite enough.
 
  For £9.50, the squid and merguez with salmorejo (Toledo’s version of gazpacho) is steep: not a lot of squid. But these are good quality, porky merguez, and the salmorejo is energised by classy sherry vinegar. A quarter of cauliflower, flower, leaf and stalk intact, has been blanched and burnt to a degree of watery softness that borders on unpleasant, then drowned in tahini sauce and cinnamon. Why, we wonder, if the perfectly serviceable lamb shawarma is "straight from the grill", is it barely warm?
 
  On the toothsome front, the inviting embrace of the milky rice pudding is lessened by the mushiness of the grain, but pepped up by a blushing slice of quince scented with rosewater. Triumphantly light olive oil sponge served with fondant dates, date molasses, and yoghurt offers a lighter Middle Eastern spin on sticky toffee pudding.
 
  Baba doesn’t appear to have the Levant in its DNA, nor is it taking Middle Eastern cooking to a new inventive level, yet it’s still one of the best bets for eating on George Street.

Alibaba Group Holding Limited BABA) recently announced that it intends to sell U.S. dollar-denominated senior unsecured notes in an underwritten registered public offering. The interest rate, conversion rate and certain other terms of the notes are yet to be determined. The Chinese e-commerce goliath stated that the net proceeds would be used for general corporate purposes. On a year-to-date basis, shares of Alibaba have steadily treaded higher. The stock has returned 117.7% compared with the industry’s gain of 65.6%. Alibaba’s Cash Position As of Sep 30, 2017, the company had cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of almost RMB159.9 (US$24.0 million) billion compared with RMB148.2 (US$21.9 million) in the prior quarter. Also, the company generated RMB30.5 billion (US$4.59 billion) of cash from operations and RMB22.5 billion (US$3.4 billion) of non-GAAP free cash flow. We believe that the company has a strong balance sheet, which will help it in capitalizing on investment opportunities and pursuing strategic acquisitions, further improving its growth prospects. Moreover, the senior notes offering will bring down the company’s cost of capital, thus strengthening its balance sheet and supporting growth. Bottom Line Alibaba Group caters mainly to its native market. We remain positive about the company’s market position, expanding customer base androbust growth in core e-commerce business. Also, its high revenues and strong metrics growth are big positives. We believe that the company is being driven by mobile and international expansion.

Gloria CerÃ³n knows disability is an important issue all over the world, particularly in her own country of Chile. 


 
But through a WHO-backed initiative, she and her colleagues at Chileâs National Disability Service have developed up-to-date information on disability in her Latin American nation, and are using this to strengthen services for people who need them. 
The Model Disability Survey, developed by WHO and the World Bank in 2011, addresses the scarcity and often poor quality of information on people with disability in many countries. The survey takes a broader approach to disability, considering not just health conditions, from depression to diabetes, but also the broader context. For example, it looks at whether public buildings are accessible to everyone, such as people who are blind or wheelchair users. 
 
âConducting the survey, and sharing its feedback with civil society, provided us an opportunity not only to deliver the results, but also to position the disability paradigm and the new way of measuring disability,â says Ms CerÃ³n, who heads the Department of Studies at the Chilean National Disability Service (SENADIS). 
In 2015, SENADIS, the Chilean Ministry of Health, and the governmentâs statistics office implemented the second national disability survey, using the WHO-World Bank model. More than a yearâs work went into preparing for the survey, including consultation with people with disability, civil society groups, their families and supporters across all 15 regions of the country. 
âWe had the opportunity to pilot and carry-out a nationwide household survey that could accurately estimate disability and allow us to update our statistics after more than a decade,â Ms CerÃ³n explains. 
WHO provided technical support to adapt the survey to Chileâs needs, on the pilot to ensure it worked well and trained people on how to conduct the survey. After it was completed, WHO helped Chilean authorities analyse the data.  
âThe training carried out by WHO was essential to achieve consensus on the definitions and measurement model of disability,â adds Ms CerÃ³n. âThis generated a change in the thinking of technical personnel in Chilean institutions that understood the disability only from a medical perspective.â
 
Dr Etienne Krug, WHOâs Director for Management of Noncommunicable Diseases, Disability, Violence and Injury Prevention, says collecting data based on the Model Disability Survey provides comprehensive information on the levels of disability in a population. 

 
âIt is critical for countries to be able to identify the number of  people who experience disability, as well as the unmet needs, barriers and inequalities they face,â Dr Krug says. âBy doing so, governments are better placed to provide the services people with disability need.â  
In Chile, the survey found that one in five people (16.7% adults, 5.8% children) experienced severe difficulties in daily life, either due to health conditions or impairments they have, and are very likely to experience disability if their needs are not met.  
Of this, 41.5% of Chileans experience severe disability and 58.5% experience mild to moderate disability.  
The Model Disability Survey also identified barriers people with disability experienced, including in health, education and transport.  
After reporting the survey results to the countryâs civil society groups, SENADIS then ensured the data was put to use to develop key plans and actions.  
For example, the survey showed that 59% of Chileans with severe disability have a mental or behavioural disorder. This finding informed the development of the National Mental Health Action Plan, which was launched in 2017, and the National Disability Action Plan currently under development.  
More than one-third of Chileans (39.3%) with a severe disability were also not working, a finding that led to the passing of the âLaw on Labor Inclusion,â which aims to improve the rates of labour force participation for people with disability.  
Data that highlighted barriers many people with disability experience in accessing transport prompted a government-led review to examine use and access to public transport to help determine priority actions.  
Due to the importance placed on understanding how many people with disability there are in Chile, and the issues they face, the countryâs National Health Survey now includes questions on disability.
This will enable the Government to better track progress, understand unmet service needs and ultimately, improve the lives of people with disability.  
The survey has also had other benefits, most notably increasing awareness on the fact that people with disability represent a significant proportion of Chileâs population. 

 
WHO has also supported the successful implementation of the Model Disability Survey in Pakistan, the Philippines and Sri Lanka, and it is currently being conducted in Qatar and Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. Planning is ongoing to undertake the survey in Costa Rica and Panama. 
"The MDS provides a comprehensive assessment of people with disability, and has contributed to making better public policy,â says Ms CerÃ³n. âFor us, it was also an opportunity to not only deliver results, but also to change how disability is positioned and measured.â

Equinix has created an empire by building data center hubs where companies can interconnect their networks – nerve centers of the internet and private corporate networks. In many places around the world, an Equinix facility is where a single customer can access an unrivaled amount of carriers, cloud companies, CDNs, and all other types of service providers who help ensure their applications or content reaches their intended end users. And while simply being inside such a nerve center already makes a network architect’s life easier (because they can reach all the networks you need from one place), turning every link up is still a complicated and lengthy process. After they’ve negotiated the terms and signed a contract with the service provider, the colocation provider has to provision a physical interconnect, and it may take days, weeks, and sometimes months, for the link to go live. Related: Digital Realty Challenges Equinix With Cloud Connectivity Platform In today’s world, where customers can provision cloud servers almost instantly, and where applications are so highly distributed that companies need to interconnect with more networks and in more places than ever, those lengthy connection provisioning lead times have become a problem. It’s a problem a handful of startups recently formed to address, and it’s a problem Equinix itself is hoping to solve for its customers with a new service it announced today. The service is called Equinix Cloud Exchange Fabric, and it aims to do to connection provisioning what Amazon Web Services did to installing servers in a data center. Using new software-defined networking capabilities in the previously existing Equinix Cloud Exchange platform, customers can choose the network they want to connect to, make a few mouse clicks, and have the link up and running in a few minutes, James Staten, Equinix’s global head of market development, said in an interview with Data Center Knowledge. Related: Equinix Positioning for “Next Wave” of Cloud Data Center Deployments Like they do for cloud infrastructure services, customers pay only for the amount of time they use the Exchange Fabric. A basic 5 megabit connection from Silicon Valley to Ashburn, for example, would cost about $350 per month, he said. Inside a single data center, a 5 megabit link will cost about $150 per month. The price goes up the more bandwidth you use and the longer distance your traffic needs to traverse. Not only does it make network interconnection within a single facility faster and easier, it does the same for linking network nodes that sit in different cities and in different metro areas. Instead of setting up an agreement with AT&T;, for example, to carry traffic between your storage cluster in Dallas and your cloud servers in Ashburn, you make a few selections through Equinix’s online portal (or your own interface that uses Equinix’s API), and Equinix handles the rest. “It’s that facility-to-facility, metro-to-metro [connectivity] that’s really interesting and powerful,” Eric Hanselman, chief analyst at 451 Research, said, commenting on the announcement. “The challenge right now is that for existing companies to be able to construct connectivity even facility to facility is relatively complex.” Staten anticipates the most common use cases for the new service will be Internet of Things applications: connecting data sources, such as sensor-bearing equipment or connected cars, to cloud service providers and Equinix enterprise customers’ own systems. Manufacturers need to collect data from their products in every metro those products are sold into for quick analysis. They don’t usually do analytics in-house, so they need to connect to cloud services like Salesforce, AWS, or Microsoft Azure in those metros, he explained. Hypothetically, data from GM vehicles on the road in Dallas would be aggregated in an Equinix data center in the Dallas-Fort Worth metro, where it would be ingested by a cloud provider for analytics. Some data would then travel back to the vehicles and some would end up on GMs servers, either in the same Equinix data center or elsewhere. Other potential use cases include movie studios, which nowadays can use dozens of contractors around the world to make a movie happen. They use private interconnection to ship content from contractor to contractor during the production process, when security and performance are essential, Staten said. Financial services companies need to connect not just to exchanges but to all other players in the ecosystem; healthcare organizations make extensive use of private connectivity because of the strict privacy rules they have to comply with; and any company that needs to connect to devices at the edge of its network, be it to support mobile apps for its employees or for its customers, should be able to use the new Equinix service as part of that edge connectivity strategy, he said. For now, the service is available for interconnecting data centers in nine markets within North America and 10 within Europe, with more locations on the way. Similar capabilities are slated to become available in Asia and Latin America next year, and eventually, Equinix wants to enable the same easy interconnection provisioning across countries and across continents.  While at first glance the offering may appear to compete with the likes of AT&T;, Verizon, Comcast, and other service providers whose presence in Equinix facilities is what makes those facilities attractive to other customers in the first place, it actually makes those carriers’ services easier to consume. “It can actually be a plus for the network operators,” Hanselman said. “Equinix simply becomes a channel” for their products. Some of them are already using the new capability to extend their geographic reach, according to Staten. The service does compete more directly with companies like Megaport and Epsilon Telecommunications, whose business models are centered on making network interconnection easier by using SDN technology. There is still value to Brisbane, Australia-based Megaport’s platform, which is focused on interconnection between facilities via Wide Area Networks than on intra-facility LAN links, and which links to many more data center providers than just Equinix, users who have no need to step out of the Equinix ecosystem may no longer be reachable for the startup. Similarly, Equinix’s new offering competes with only a part of the value proposition of Epsilon, which provides full solutions, including connectivity to branch offices and as far out to the edge as home workers. The Equinix Cloud Exchange Fabric makes life easier for network architects by giving them an easier way to connect to service providers, partners, and clients while giving carriers a powerful channel partner and a platform that makes their services easier to buy, but at the end of the day, the biggest winner here is Equinix, which by enabling easier interconnection makes its facilities both more desirable and more “sticky” for its customers. “All of this is helping to go feed a greater motivation to move into collocated facilities in some form or fashion,” Hanselman said. “Equinix wins when people are connected.”

By Alwyn Scott NEW YORK (Reuters) - General Electric Co <GE.N> said on Friday it was laying off workers at its power division in Schenectady, New York, as it tries to reduce costs after a steep profit drop at the division. GE declined to disclose the number of workers affected. A report by local ABC TV affiliate News10, citing sources inside GE's Schenectady plant, said about 75 people had been notified that they are being let go. So far this year, GE has laid off at least 75 other workers in New York state, according to state records. GE Chief Executive John Flannery, who took over in August, has promised to cut $1 billion in company spending this year and $2 billion in 2018, as the company grapples with its weak financial results and declining share price. GE's profit fell about 9 percent in the third quarter. GE has grounded corporate jets, eliminated company cars for hundreds of executives, delayed part of its Boston headquarters and reduced employment in many locations. The company has also changed a number of top executives, including installing a new CFO, and plans to exit more than $20 billion in business in the next two years. "GE has previously announced a plan to reduce $3 billion in cost by the end of 2018," the company said in a statement. "Those actions include, but are not limited to, employee reductions, which have been under way for many months." GE said "a significant decline in orders" at GE Power prompted the layoffs in Schenectady. Workers will receive severance and help finding new jobs, GE said. GE's downsizing is not limited to its power division. In July, the company disclosed plans to lay off 575 workers at a railroad locomotive plant in Erie, Pennsylvania. An August report commissioned by the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America Local 506, which represents the workers, estimated they earn about $108,000 a year in pay and benefits.

Source: Shutterstock General Electric Co. (NYSE:GE) is going nowhere fast. It is beginning a long restructuring journey that will take years to bear fruit and the outcome is uncertain. It is good that it has begun this long march, but it’s still one step in the journey of a thousand miles. If you buy GE stock today, know you’re taking a risk. At its Dec. 1 opening price of about $18.25 per share, GE is valued at $158 billion, with assets, net of debt, of about $242 billion. Operating cash flow that once averaged $50 billion per year has flat-lined and the once-generous dividend has been cut in half. The good news is that CEO John Flannery has admitted to all the problems I detailed in my Nov. 13 story. He understands that GE has become a pale imitation of itself, that it sold financial and entertainment assets at their lows, bought energy and power assets at their highs. Traders are betting it will go still lower. While Flannery has put in a good team and the company retains the lobbying clout of the country’s oldest industrial giant, it faces a long road back. The professionals who measure such things call GE stock a strong sell. So why are insiders buying? As Luke Lango noted this week, four insiders bought $56 million of GE stock during the last two weeks of November. They see that total revenue only dropped slightly even while the power business was collapsing, that it can streamline and focus on what’s growing and turn around that sales momentum in 2018. Insiders are seen as smart money and they’re picking up a bargain at its fair market value, at a time when imaginary assets like Bitcoin are trading at $10,000. GE directors, however, can wait for their profit, and GE officers have an incentive to show their loyalty to the new boss. What is smart for them may not be smart for the average investor.

The iconic American conglomerate has a new boss and a new strategy by V.V.V. General Electric (GE), an industrial conglomerate founded by Thomas Edison 125 years ago, is in trouble. Its market valuation, once over $400bn, is now closer to $150bn. Its share price has fallen by about two-fifths this year alone. The firm recently replaced Jeffrey Immelt, its long-serving chairman and CEO, with John Flannery (pictured), another company veteran. What went wrong at one of America’s best-known and oldest companies? GE’s traditional strengths are in asset-heavy, engineering-oriented industries. Starting with electrical goods (Edison famously commercialised the light bulb), the firm expanded into areas such as power-generation equipment, locomotives, industrial plastics and aviation. It also built up a successful business in health-care technology, making high-end medical scanners and other fancy kit. Its global network of research laboratories is one of the world’s top generators of new patents. Under Jack Welch, who ran the firm from 1981 to 2001, GE expanded dramatically (with hindsight, analysts say recklessly) into financial services, which by 2000 contributed more than half of the profits. The diversification away from the company’s core strengths made it seem much more valuable to investors, but this proved a chimera. The financial engineering was built on unsustainably risky bets, and the distractions arising from that complicated and politicised business led bosses to ignore festering problems on the industrial side. Receive our Daily Dispatch and Editors’ Picks newsletters. After GE’s finance arm had been weakened by the global financial crisis Mr Immelt wound down the company’s financial holdings. Its current troubles are primarily the result of his failure to prepare GE for heightened competition in a slowing global energy market. This has squeezed GE’s power business, its biggest division, and the firm expects operating profits in this segment to decline by over 25% in 2018. Mr Immelt also made some expensive acquisitions at a time of low oil prices. He spent $10.1bn to buy Alstom, a French company selling power-generation kit, and $7.4bn to win control of Baker Hughes, an American oilfield-services group. Neither is doing as well as hoped.  Mr Flannery unveiled a new strategy in November. It rests on three pillars: cost control, cultural change and cuts. He slashed the promised dividend by half, which will save on top of the $2bn in annual cuts Mr Immelt was forced to concede earlier this year. Mr Flannery is using carrots and sticks to restore management’s focus on financial returns. He will alter the pay structure to incentivise executives to generate free cash flow. He is also slimming down the unwieldy and toothless board of directors, even placing an activist investor on the board. But while his approach to costs and culture looks sensible, big investors wonder at his efforts to shrink the firm. Mr Flannery says he will dispose of some $20bn in assets in the next two years. That may sound like a lot, but is rather less impressive compared with GE’s total assets last year of $365bn. If Mr Flannery can defy the sceptics and turn the firm around, he will deserve to surpass even the lionised Mr Welch in the annals of American management.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew, File)(Photo: Richard Drew, AP) GE Power, one of Greenville County's top employers, has confirmed it has laid off an undisclosed number of workers from its facilities here. Katie Jackson, a spokeswoman at the energy giant's headquarters in Schenectady, New York, shared a prepared statement with The News that mirrors information the company sent to news outlets in Schenectady, which also experienced layoffs this week. "Based on the current challenges in the power industry and a significant decline in orders, GE Power continues to transform our new, combined business to better meet the needs of our customers," the statement said. "As we have said, we are working to reduce costs and simplify our structure to better align our product solutions, and these steps will include layoffs." In this Monday, Nov. 13, 2017, photo provided by General Electric, GE Chairman and CEO John Flannery addresses investors at a meeting in New York. Flannery said the company is weighing the future of its transportation, industrial, and lighting businesses so that it can focus more intently on its most profitable divisions. (Eli Kabillio/General Electric via AP) (Photo: Eli Kabillio, AP) The company did not answer inquiries about how many people would be laid off, the time frame of the layoffs or what positions those laid off held. GE Power designs and manufactures heavy-duty gas turbines and 1.5-megawatt wind turbines at its facilities in Greenville. About 3,400 people work there, according to the Greenville Area Development Corp. The energy giant that Thomas Edison started has been a major force in Greenville's economy since it announced plans to build a plant here 50 years ago. Still, these are not GE's first layoffs this year. In March, the company announced it was laying off a small percentage of its employees at its Garlington Road facility. At the time, the company released a statement, saying it was "taking employee actions to simplify its structure" in the wake of "current challenges in the power market." General Electric opens Greenville plant in 1960s GE reports layoffs at Greenville site GE's statement this week said the decision to lay off more workers did not reflect employee performance. Workers will receive comprehensive severance packages, according to the statement, including outplacement and transition support to find new jobs. The announcement comes two weeks after new GE CEO John Flannery, himself a 30-year GE employee, announced at an investors meeting that the company would be cutting $1 billion in structural costs in 2018. GE is also weighing the future of its transportation, industrial and lighting businesses to focus more on its most profitable divisions, Flannery said. "This is a heavy lift, but we know where we're going," Flannery told investors, according to a transcript of the meeting. Flannery ascended to GE's top job in June and announced in October, according to an Associated Press report, that GE would shed business units worth more than $20 billion over the next year or two.

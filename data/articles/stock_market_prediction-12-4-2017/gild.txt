Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) and MannKind Corporation (NASDAQ:MNKD) are both Healthcare companies that recently hit new low. This price action has ruffled more than a few feathers in the investment community, but is one a better investment than the other? To answer this, we will compare the two companies across growth, profitability, risk, return, dividends, and valuation measures. Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) operates in the Biotechnology segment of the Healthcare sector. The company has grown sales at a 29.40% annual rate over the past five years, putting it in the high growth category. GILD has a net profit margin of 42.20% and is more profitable than the average company in the Biotechnology industry. In terms of efficiency, GILD has an asset turnover ratio of 0.45. This figure represents the amount of revenue a company generates per dollar of assets. GILD’s financial leverage ratio is 1.39, which indicates that the company’s asset base is primarily funded by equity capital. Company’s return on equity, which is really just the product of the company’s profit margin, asset turnover, and financial leverage ratios, is 53.40%, which is better than the Biotechnology industry average ROE. Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD) pays out an annual dividend of 2.08 per share. At the current valuation, this equates to a dividend yield of 2.76%. The company has a payout ratio of 22.90%. GILD’s current dividend therefore should be sustainable. Stock’s free cash flow yield, which represents the amount of cash available to investors before dividends, expressed as a percentage of the stock price, is 1.9. All else equal, companies with higher FCF yields are viewed as cheaper. Company trades at a P/E ratio of 8.57 , and is less expensive than the average stock in the Biotechnology industry. The average investment recommendation for GILD, taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts, is 2.40, or a buy. Over the past three months, Gilead Sciences, Inc. insiders have been net buyers, dumping a net of -465,983 shares. This implies that insiders have been feeling relatively bearish about the outlook for GILD. Insider activity and sentiment signals are important to monitor because they can shed light on how “risky” a stock is perceived to be at it’s current valuation. Knowing this, it makes sense to look at beta, a measure of market risk. GILD has a beta of 1.15 and therefore an above average level of market volatility.

 China is hot and soaring among all the other equity markets this year thanks to improving economic growth. In fact, China is leading the global markets, attaining the best-performing country spot in the year-to-date time frame (read: 4 International ETFs Worth Buying at New Highs  ).  makeArticleAd();  But the incredible run eased somewhat last week as a combination of factors including tightening liquidity and jitters over bond markets led to steep sell-off in the large-cap shares. The blue-chip CSI300 Index tumbled nearly 3% on Nov 23, marking the worst one-day loss in nearly 18 months. The sell-off was again witnessed on Nov 27, with CSI 300 Index dropping 1.3%.   Inside The Pain    Worries over tightening liquidity have built up lately as China took steps to restrict the rapidly growing and lightly regulated market for online micro-lenders to fend off financial risk. The central bank has suspended regulatory approval for setting up of new Internet micro-lenders, sending shares of U.S.-listed Chinese financial firms into a tailspin.    Meanwhile, rising Chinese bond yields spooked investors, dulling the attractiveness of the stock markets as an alternative higher-yielding investment. This is because rising yields will increase financing costs and thus have a negative impact on corporate profits.    If these weren't enough, the Chinese government's warning about lofty valuation for one of the nation's hottest stocks, Kweichow Moutai Co, added to the woes. The government cautioned that shares of China's biggest liquor maker is rising too fast, creating panic among investors.      Rounds of downbeat data also took a toll on the stock market. Profits at China's industrial firms slightly cooled down in October, rising 25.1% after jumping 27.7% in September. Meanwhile, debt climbed 23% in September - the fastest pace in four years (read: China Economic Data Disappoints: ETFs in Focus  ).     ETF Impact    Quite expectedly, the terrible trading has been felt in the Chinese ETF world too. Funds in this space also saw big losses over the past one week. VanEck Vectors China SME-ChiNext ETF CNXT   was the biggest loser shedding 4.8% in the same time frame, followed by declines of 3.3% in Deutsche X-trackers Harvest CSI 500 China-A Shares Small Cap Fund ASHS   , and 2.6% each in Guggenheim China Technology ETF CQQQ  and Global X NASDAQ China Technology ETF QQQC   (see: all the emerging Asia Pacific ETFs here  ).

In fact, China is leading the global markets, attaining the best-performing country spot in the year-to-date time frame (read: 4 International ETFs Worth Buying at New Highs  ).  makeArticleAd();  But the incredible run eased somewhat last week as a combination of factors including tightening liquidity and jitters over bond markets led to steep sell-off in the large-cap shares. The blue-chip CSI300 Index tumbled nearly 3% on Nov 23, marking the worst one-day loss in nearly 18 months. The sell-off was again witnessed on Nov 27, with CSI 300 Index dropping 1.3%.   Inside The Pain    Worries over tightening liquidity have built up lately as China took steps to restrict the rapidly growing and lightly regulated market for online micro-lenders to fend off financial risk. The central bank has suspended regulatory approval for setting up of new Internet micro-lenders, sending shares of U.S.-listed Chinese financial firms into a tailspin.    Meanwhile, rising Chinese bond yields spooked investors, dulling the attractiveness of the stock markets as an alternative higher-yielding investment. This is because rising yields will increase financing costs and thus have a negative impact on corporate profits.    If these weren't enough, the Chinese government's warning about lofty valuation for one of the nation's hottest stocks, Kweichow Moutai Co, added to the woes. The government cautioned that shares of China's biggest liquor maker is rising too fast, creating panic among investors.      Rounds of downbeat data also took a toll on the stock market. Profits at China's industrial firms slightly cooled down in October, rising 25.1% after jumping 27.7% in September. Meanwhile, debt climbed 23% in September - the fastest pace in four years (read: China Economic Data Disappoints: ETFs in Focus  ).     ETF Impact    Quite expectedly, the terrible trading has been felt in the Chinese ETF world too.

Recent insider trends for Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) have caught the attention of investors.

Gilead Sciences, Inc.  (NASDAQ: GILD) stands to benefit on multiple fronts, which prompted an analyst to upgrade the shares of the company Thursday. Maxim Group analyst Jason McCarthy upgraded his rating on the shares of Gilead Sciences from Hold to Buy and  set a $94 price target.  The  Kite Pharma Inc  (NASDAQ: KITE)  buy comes with the stock "for free"; the comparisons are easing for Gilead Sciences' HCV franchise; and Gilead had $2.7 billion in free cash flow in the recently reported quarter, McCarthy said in a note. (See McCarthy's track record here.)  Following a meeting with senior executives in Beijing, where manufacturing plans for the launch of Yescarta were presented, Maxim said it is now confident the company can overcome manufacturing challenges to commercialize in the U.S. and globally.  Yescarta — a cell-based gene therapy to treat adult patients with certain types of large B-cell lymphoma who have not responded to or who have relapsed after at least two other kinds of treatment — was approved by the FDA in October. Maxim views this as the start, with approvals likely coming in Europe, China and Japan. "With a global presence in late stage B cell cancer, Gilead is positioned to generate over $5 billion in outyears," McCarthy said.  Maxim's model now incorporates Yescarta revenues from China and Japan, in addition to revenues from both the U.S. and EU. The Kite acquisition makes Gilead Sciences an industry leader in cell therapy, McCarthy said. "This is the start of a new oncology paradigm."  Gilead Sciences' shares are up 2.88 percentyear-to-date, underperforming the 17.3-percent gain for the  iShares NASDAQ Biotechnology Index (ETF)  (NASDAQ: IBB). At the time of writing, shares of Gilead Sciences were rising 1.33 percent to $74.65.

The OnePlus 5T has a very in-demand feature in smartphones right now — a 3.5mm headphone jack; but that doesn’t mean it’s the way you should be listening to music on the phone. OnePlus is one of the few manufacturers that supports Bluetooth AptX HD into its phones. It’s a wireless audio codec that provides a greater than CD quality sound when using compatible wireless headphones. To experience AptX HD, you need to follow a few simple stages to get it working. Here’s our guide to enjoying AptX HD on your OnePlus 5T. If you haven’t bought a OnePlus 5T yet, read our OnePlus 5T review to find out why you should. Owning the OnePlus 5T gets you only halfway to AptX HD audio nirvana. You also need an AptX HD-ready pair of headphones. That’s right, your old pair of well-used in-ears that came free with an old phone won’t cut it here. You’re going to have to splash out, but it’s worth it. The easiest way to find out what headphones are ready for AptX HD is visit the AptX website, where you’ll find a complete, up-to-date list of compatible hardware. We are particular fans of the amazing Audio Technica ATH-DSR9BT over-ears, the Bowers & Wilkins PX noise canceling headphones, and LG’s Tone Active+ halo-style in-ears. More products are being released with AptX HD support all the time, so if you don’t find a pair to suit right now, do keep checking back. You’ve got your OnePlus 5T, and the right pair of Bluetooth headphones all ready to go. Now, we need to prepare and then pair them together. Here are the stages you need to follow: That’s it, you’re now set up for the best wireless audio quality you’ll hear. When you use AptX HD and play hi-res files, the sound is as close to high resolution audio quality usually provided by wired headphones as you’ll get. It plays up to 48kHz/24-bit LPCM audio, and it’s genuinely unlike any wireless Bluetooth experience you’ll have had before. To get this, you should use hi-res sources, such as Tidal HiFi, or your own hi-res music files. Playing regular MP3 files, or music from Spotify, will sound better using AptX HD; but it won’t be the eye-opening experience you’ll have with hi-res content. 

http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/12/01/new-oneplus-3-3t-open-beta-adds-aptx-hd-support-visual-tweaks/

 Not to be outdone by their newer, younger cousins, the OnePlus 3/3T have received a new Open Beta. This one contains some UI visual tweaks, various performance optimizations, and the addition of aptX and aptX HD support for yesteryear's flagship killers. And here's the changelog: If you're a fan of the OnePlus Launcher, be looking out for that "optimized shelf visual style," whatever that means. The gallery looks like it's getting the update we saw hit not too long ago. But the main highlight here is the addition of both aptX and aptX HD support for Bluetooth audio. I cannot test to see if this is the same on for the OP3/3T, but on the OnePlus 5 Open Beta, you get an annoying notification whenever you connect a Bluetooth headset that makes sure to tell you that you're using Qualcomm aptX — thanks, OnePlus! You can see what I mean in the image below.  As usual, if you haven't gotten the OTA update yet, you can either flash it manually after downloading it from the appropriate source links below, or you can do the whole VPN trick. Have fun! The OTA Oreo update really improved the speed of my 3T. Really fast and works better. Don't know how a beta version would do for it, but it's plenty fine right now with an official stable release. I find that the Open Betas, both OP3/3T and OP5, are pretty quick. I mean, it's just sped up animations, but still. Running the beta on my OP5 now, actually. Yeah and the best part if you report a bug with logs that identify the issue it'll be fixed within 2 weeks when the next Open Beta is out  Google is paying 97$ per hour,with weekly payouts.You can also avail this.
On tuesday I got a brand new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $11752 this last four weeks..with-out any doubt it's the most-comfortable job I have ever done .. It Sounds unbelievable but you wont forgive yourself if you don’t check it

JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) looks like a runaway train, but it’s far from derailing. It’s still a value from which I can profit. Investors on Wall Street rejoiced yesterday and pushed banks stocks up a bunch. For example, JPM stock gained 3.5% on the day, which is very unusual without any specific headline. But it wasn’t the only one — the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLF) was up 2.6% and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) was also up 4%. So is it too late to chase and go long JPMorgan Chase stock? No. I will go long the stock but without much of the usual hopium that requires higher prices to profit. My trade will be profitable even if JPM stock falls another 20%. JPM is the creme of the crop of financial institutions. They rarely give traders specific cause to sell the stock. They also have a fortress balance sheet. Furthermore, after the most recent stress tests, management vowed to financial engineer the stock with buybacks and dividends. So it’s no wonder that the stock is up 28% in one year. Even at these levels JPM is not expensive. It still only trades at a price-to-earnings ratio under 15x. This is cheap by any standard. Furthermore, it only trades at 1.5 times book value. So I am very confident that it won’t be a mistake if I have to own shares at a discount from here. Although the Donald Trump administration has had its challenges, they stay committed to removing red tape for banks. So these favorable operating conditions are likely to persist. In addition, we are still in a cycle of rate tightening which in theory should also benefit JPM bottom line. Technically, this spike on Tuesday helped avert a retest of an important ascending trend line, which could have threatened JPMorgan’s trajectory. Now it’s in the clear from it for a while. Moreover, it speaks to the difficult of shorting these bank stocks. The fewer traders that are willing to short the easier the path upwards.

The shares of Oracle Corporation have increased by more than 27.59% this year alone. The shares recently went up by 1.11% or $0.54 and now trades at $49.06. The shares of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), has jumped by 21.13% year to date as of 11/29/2017. The shares currently trade at $104.52 and have been able to report a change of 5.96% over the past one week. The stock of Oracle Corporation and JPMorgan Chase & Co. were two of the most active stocks on Wedday. Investors seem to be very interested in what happens to the stocks of these two companies but do investors favor one over the other? We will analyze the growth, profitability, risk, valuation, and insider trends of both companies and see which one investors prefer. Next 5Y EPS Growth: 8.79% versus 8.81% When a company is able to grow consistently in terms of earnings at a high compound rate have the highest likelihood of creating value for its shareholders over time. Analysts have predicted that ORCL will grow it’s earning at a 8.79% annual rate in the next 5 years. This is in contrast to JPM which will have a positive growth at a 8.81% annual rate. This means that the higher growth rate of JPM implies a greater potential for capital appreciation over the years. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Profitability and Returns Growth alone cannot be used to see if the company will be valuable. Shareholders will be the losers if a company invest in ventures that aren’t profitable enough to support upbeat growth. In order for us to accurately measure profitability and return, we will be using the EBITDA margin and Return on Investment (ROI), which balances the difference in capital structure. ORCL has an EBITDA margin of 42.26%, this implies that the underlying business of JPM is more profitable. The ROI of ORCL is 9.50% while that of JPM is 5.90%. These figures suggest that ORCL ventures generate a higher ROI than that of JPM. Cash Flow  
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 The value of a stock is ultimately determined by the amount of cash flow that the investors have available. Over the last 12 months, ORCL’s free cash flow per share is a positive 13.72, while that of JPM is positive 0. Liquidity and Financial Risk The ability of a company to meet up with its short-term obligations and be able to clear its longer-term debts is measured using Liquidity and leverage ratios. The debt ratio of ORCL is 0.94 compared to 1.24 for JPM. JPM can be able to settle its long-term debts and thus is a lower financial risk than ORCL. Valuation ORCL currently trades at a forward P/E of 15.44, a P/B of 3.64, and a P/S of 5.30 while JPM trades at a forward P/E of 13.68, a P/B of 1.59, and a P/S of 5.88. This means that looking at the earnings, book values and sales basis, ORCL is the cheaper one. It is very obvious that earnings are the most important factors to investors, thus analysts are most likely to place their bet on the P/E. Analyst Price Targets and Opinions The mistake some people make is that they think a cheap stock has more value to it. In order to know the value of a stock, there is need to compare its current price to its likely trading price in the future. The price of ORCL is currently at a -13.09% to its one-year price target of 56.45. Looking at its rival pricing, JPM is at a 5% relative to its price target of 99.54. This figure implies that over the next one year, JPM is a better investment. When looking at the investment recommendation on say a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell), ORCL is given a 2.00 while 2.60 placed for JPM. This means that analysts are more bullish on the outlook for JPM stocks. Insider Activity and Investor Sentiment Short interest or otherwise called the percentage of a stock’s tradable shares currently being shorted is another data that investors use to get a handle on sentiment. The short ratio for ORCL is 1.96 while that of JPM is just 2.36. This means that analysts are more bullish on the forecast for ORCL stock. Conclusion The stock of JPMorgan Chase & Co. defeats that of Oracle Corporation when the two are compared, with JPM taking 4 out of the total factors that were been considered. JPM happens to be more profitable, generates a higher ROI, has higher cash flow per share, higher liquidity and has a lower financial risk. When looking at the stock valuation, JPM is the cheaper one on an earnings, book value and sales basis. Finally, the sentiment signal for JPM is better on when it is viewed on short interest.

 Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that JPM may be headed in the future. To forecast a stock’s future performance, analysts use momentum indicators, which take into account the size and speed of these price movements. As momentum begins to slow, it may be a sign that a recent trend is about to reverse. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for JPM is 68.13%, which suggests that the stock is not particularly expensive or cheap, and not predisposed to a reactive price movement based on this measure. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 73.41%, tells a different story, and suggests that JPM currently trades in overbought territory. What do the trading volumes reveal? Price isn’t the only tool analysts use to forecast future performance. Volume patterns can also reveal some important insights. If, for instance, a stock’s volumes suddenly increase by a significant amount, it’s usually a sign that the level of conviction behind the trade is high. Investors may feel very strongly about the future direction of the stock in question. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) average trading volume of 11,606,920 during the past month is 14.29% below its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been less active than usual in the stock in recent times.

How risky is the stock?  When analyzing a stock’s price performance, it’s essential to take risk into account. Beta, which measures a stock’s volatility relative to the overall market, can be used to gauge the level of systematic risk associated with a particular stock. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) has a beta of 1.21, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are more extreme than the market as a whole.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) looks like a runaway train, but it’s far from derailing. It’s still a value from which I can profit. Investors on Wall Street rejoiced yesterday and pushed banks stocks up a bunch. For example, JPM stock gained 3.5% on the day, which is very unusual without any specific headline. But it wasn’t the only one — the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLF) was up 2.6% and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) was also up 4%. So is it too late to chase and go long JPMorgan Chase stock? No. I will go long the stock but without much of the usual hopium that requires higher prices to profit. My trade will be profitable even if JPM stock falls another 20%. JPM is the creme of the crop of financial institutions. They rarely give traders specific cause to sell the stock. They also have a fortress balance sheet. Furthermore, after the most recent stress tests, management vowed to financial engineer the stock with buybacks and dividends. So it’s no wonder that the stock is up 28% in one year. Even at these levels JPM is not expensive. It still only trades at a price-to-earnings ratio under 15x. This is cheap by any standard. Furthermore, it only trades at 1.5 times book value. So I am very confident that it won’t be a mistake if I have to own shares at a discount from here. Although the Donald Trump administration has had its challenges, they stay committed to removing red tape for banks. So these favorable operating conditions are likely to persist. In addition, we are still in a cycle of rate tightening which in theory should also benefit JPM bottom line. Technically, this spike on Tuesday helped avert a retest of an important ascending trend line, which could have threatened JPMorgan’s trajectory. Now it’s in the clear from it for a while. Moreover, it speaks to the difficult of shorting these bank stocks. The fewer traders that are willing to short the easier the path upwards.

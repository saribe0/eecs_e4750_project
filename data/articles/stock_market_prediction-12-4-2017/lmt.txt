 Lockheed Martin Corp. 's LMT business segment, Rotary and Missions Systems (RMS) has won a modification contract for exercising options to procure technical insertion (TI)-16 Acoustic Rapid Commercial Off-the-Shelf Insertion (A-RCI) systems, pre-cable kits and A-RCI sonar engineering services.Contract Details
 Valued at $102 million, this contract has been awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington Navy Yard, Washington, DC.
 The majority of the work will be carried out in Manassas, VA, while the rest will be executed in Clearwater, FL. The deal is expected to be complete by December 2018.
 Lockheed Martin will utilize fiscal 2018 shipbuilding and conversion (Navy), fiscal 2018 research and development test and evaluation, and fiscal 2018 other procurement (Navy) funds to complete the work.A Brief Note on A-RCI Systems
 A-RCI is an open-architecture sonar system that uses legacy sensors. It also replaces central processors with commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) computer technology and software within submarines.  This system helps the U.S. Navy in searching, detecting and tracking submarines and surface vessels in open-ocean and littoral sea environments without being counter-detected. It facilitates covert execution of Naval Special Warfare missions and under-ice operations as well.
 In the 1990s, Lockheed Martin unveiled A-RCI Systems, which allowed frequent hardware and software upgrades. The system was highly effective and offered improved acoustic quieting measures at a far lower cost than previously possible. Notably, the A-RCI TI 18-20 engineering services provide engineering development to support modernization requirements.Our View
 With the rapid rise in terrorist attacks over the last decade, the U.S. Navy's focus has shifted to littoral waters, the shallow areas near coastlines. These are the areas that it must patrol and defend against small subs, underwater mines and fast attack boats. Considering this, the need for timely detection and localization of quiet subs in the especially noisy shallow-water sonar field has made the ARCI submarine sonar system very much critical. Additionally, constant upgrades of the system have made it more valuable for the nation's naval base and an attractive choice of defense equipment for the U.S. allied countries.
 As geopolitical uncertainty continues to prevail across the globe, we expect renowned defense contractors like Lockheed Martin to win more such deals in the days to come. A quick peek into the company's third-quarter earnings numbers also reflects this. In particular, the RMS segment generated revenues of $3.4 billion in the third quarter, reflecting 27.9% of the company's total revenues.
 Moreover, the company's improved cash outlook for 2017 reflects enhanced cash performance at the Rotary and Mission Systems division. That said, the aforementioned contract gain has the potential to boost revenues at this segment.
 Furthermore, the fiscal 2018 defense policy has authorized the United States to spend $700 billion on defense. This has further enhanced the prospect of increased order flow from Pentagon for major defense contractors like Lockheed Martin, Raytheon Company RTN , Northrop Grumman Corporation NOC , The Boeing Company BA and others.Price Movement
 Lockheed Martin's stock was up about 19.8% in a year compared with the broader industry 's gain of 36%. This underperformance could have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces owing to its broad portfolio of products and services domestically as well as internationally.

Shares of AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AMC) are on a recovery track as they have regained 29.63% since bottoming out on Nov. 13, 2017. Thanks to a rise of almost 1.08% in the past five days, the stock price is now down -58.4% so far on the year — still in weak territory. In this case, shares are down -60.56% , the 52-week high touched on Dec. 28, 2016, but are collecting gains at -58.21% for the past 12 months.  Brokerage houses, on average, are recommending investors to hold AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (AMC)’s shares projecting a $21.58 target price. Analysts‟ target price forecasts are a prediction of a stock‟s future price, generally over the 12 months following the release date (Asquith et al., 2005). This forecast is a point estimate that provides investors with a benchmark against which to directly compare stock price in the short run.Target prices made by analysts employed by large brokers, who have access to a greater resource pool, are more likely to be met over the 12-month forecast period.  AMC’s revenue has grown at an average annualized rate of about 5.1% during the past five years. However, the company’s most recent quarter increase of 51.2% looks attractive. The sales growth rate for a stock is a measure of how the stock’s sales per share (SPS) has grown over a specific period of time. It tells an investor how quickly a company is increasing its revenues. The sales growth rate helps investors determine how strong the overall growth-orientation is for a stock or portfolio.   The best measure of a company is its profitability, for without it, it cannot grow, and if it doesn’t grow, then its stock will trend downward. Increasing profits are the best indication that a company can pay dividends and that the share price will trend upward. Creditors will loan money at a cheaper rate to a profitable company than to an unprofitable one; consequently, profitable companies can use leverage to increase stockholders’ equity even more. Profitability ratios compare different accounts to see how efficiently a business is generating profits. These ratios show how well income is generated through operations, and are important to both creditors and investors. They help determine the company’s ability to continue operating. Currently, AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. net profit margin for the 12 months is at -3.96%. Comparatively, the peers have a net margin 12.69%, and the sector’s average is 14.6%. In that light, it seems in weak position compared to its peers and sector. The profit margin measures the amount of net income earned with each dollar’s worth of revenue. It shows the percentage of sales that remain after all of the company’s expenses have been paid. The higher the ratio, the better.  Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) is another stock that is grabbing investors attention these days. Its shares have trimmed -2.68% since hitting a peak level on Oct. 13, 2017. Thanks to an increase of almost 2.27% in the past one month, the stock price is now outperforming with 25.46% so far on the year — still in strong zone. In this case, shares are 27.73% higher, the worst price in 52 weeks suffered on Dec. 12, 2016, and are keeping their losses at 11.94% for the past six months.  The good news is there’s still room for Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT) to grow. At recent closing price of $313.57, LMT has a chance to add $15.28 or 4.87% in 52 weeks, based on mean target price ($328.85) placed by analysts.The analyst consensus opinion of 2.3 looks like a hold. It has a 36-month beta of 0.57 , so you might not be in for a bumpy ride.  For the past 5 years, Lockheed Martin Corporation’s EPS growth has been nearly 9.6%. Sure, the percentage is encouraging but better times are ahead as looking out over a next 5-year period, analysts expect the company to see its earnings go up by 4.64%, annually.  Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT)’s ROE is 162.99%, while industry’s is 48.66%. The average ROE for the sector stands at 13.67%. The return on equity (ROE), also known as return on investment (ROI), is the best measure of the return, since it is the product of the operating performance, asset turnover, and debt-equity management of the firm. If a firm can borrow money and use it to achieve a higher return than the cost of the debt, then the leveraging creates additional revenue that accrues to stockholders as increased equity.  Lockheed Martin Corporation’s ROA is 7.38%, while industry’s average is 2.74%. As with any return, the higher this number the better. However, it, too, needs to be taken into the context of a company’s peer group as well as its sector. The average return on assets for companies in the same sector is 5.5. The return on assets (ROA) (aka return on total assets, return on average assets), is one of the most widely used profitability ratios because it is related to both profit margin and asset turnover, and shows the rate of return for both creditors and investors of the company. ROA shows how well a company controls its costs and utilizes its resources.

https://www.stocknewsgazette.com/2017/12/01/raytheon-company-rtn-vs-lockheed-martin-corporation-lmt-which-is-the-better-investment/

Raytheon Company (NYSE:RTN) shares are up more than 34.61% this year and recently increased 1.36% or $2.57 to settle at $191.15. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), on the other hand, is up 27.68% year to date as of 11/29/2017. It currently trades at $319.12 and has returned 1.35% during the past week. Raytheon Company (NYSE:RTN) and Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) are the two most active stocks in the Aerospace/Defense Products & Services industry based on today’s trading volumes. The market is clearly enthusiastic about both these stocks, but which is the better investment? To answer this, we will compare the two companies based on the strength of their growth, profitability, risk, returns, valuation, analyst recommendations, and insider trends. Growth One of the key things investors look for in a company is the ability to grow earnings at a high compound rate over time. Analysts expect RTN to grow earnings at a 9.29% annual rate over the next 5 years. Comparatively, LMT is expected to grow at a 4.64% annual rate. All else equal, RTN’s higher growth rate would imply a greater potential for capital appreciation. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Profitability and Returns Growth isn’t very attractive to investors if companies are sacrificing profitability and shareholder returns to achieve that growth. We will use EBITDA margin and Return on Investment (ROI), which control for differences in capital structure between the two companies, to measure profitability and return., compared to an EBITDA margin of 10.96% for Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT). RTN’s ROI is 15.40% while LMT has a ROI of 28.00%. The interpretation is that LMT’s business generates a higher return on investment than RTN’s. Cash Flow  
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Cash is king when it comes to investing. RTN’s free cash flow (“FCF”) per share for the trailing twelve months was +0.02. Comparatively, LMT’s free cash flow per share was +3.48. On a percent-of-sales basis, RTN’s free cash flow was 0.02% while LMT converted 2.11% of its revenues into cash flow. This means that, for a given level of sales, LMT is able to generate more free cash flow for investors. Liquidity and Financial Risk Balance sheet risk is one of the biggest factors to consider before investing. RTN has a current ratio of 1.70 compared to 1.30 for LMT. This means that RTN can more easily cover its most immediate liabilities over the next twelve months. RTN’s debt-to-equity ratio is 0.00 versus a D/E of 0.00 for LMT. RTN is therefore the more solvent of the two companies, and has lower financial risk. Valuation RTN trades at a forward P/E of 23.05, a P/B of 5.12, and a P/S of 2.24, compared to a forward P/E of 23.82, a P/B of 43.66, and a P/S of 1.84 for LMT. Given that earnings are what matter most to investors, analysts tend to place a greater weight on the P/E. Analyst Price Targets and Opinions A cheap stock is not necessarily a value stock. Most of the time, a stock is cheap for good reason. A stock only has value if the current price is substantially below the price at which it should trade in the future. RTN is currently priced at a -6.76% to its one-year price target of 205.00. Comparatively, LMT is -2.96% relative to its price target of 328.85. This suggests that RTN is the better investment over the next year. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 1.70 for RTN and 2.30 for LMT, which implies that analysts are more bullish on the outlook for LMT. Risk and Volatility Analyst use beta to measure a stock’s volatility relative to the overall market. Stocks with a beta above 1 tend to have bigger swings in price than the market as a whole, the opposite being the case for stocks with a beta below 1. RTN has a beta of 0.57 and LMT’s beta is 0.57. LMT’s shares are therefore the less volatile of the two stocks. Insider Activity and Investor Sentiment Short interest is another tool that analysts use to gauge investor sentiment. It represents the percentage of a stock’s tradable shares that are being shorted. RTN has a short ratio of 2.16 compared to a short interest of 2.11 for LMT. This implies that the market is currently less bearish on the outlook for LMT. Summary Raytheon Company (NYSE:RTN) beats Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) on a total of 7 of the 14 factors compared between the two stocks. RTN is growing fastly, is more profitable and higher liquidity. In terms of valuation, RTN is the cheaper of the two stocks on an earnings and book value, RTN is more undervalued relative to its price target. Finally, MOS has better sentiment signals based on short interest.

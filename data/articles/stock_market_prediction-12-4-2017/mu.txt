Shares of semiconductor stocks as a group suffered losses last week, with the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NYSEARCA:SMH) dropping nearly 6% for its worst one-week slide in 2017 thus far. Within this group shares of Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) as a result have finally had a chance to work down the severe near-term overbought readings and are also arriving at a better technical area of support. Traders and active investors would be wise to take note, for a next bullish trade looks to be setting up very soon. The technology sector of the S&P 500 as a whole has performed notably well again in 2017, and within this sector semiconductors have showed outstanding performance. The medium- and longer-term up-trends in this space remain well intact despite last week’s hiccup, which is to say that a buying opportunity should be just around the corner. 
Click to Enlarge Moving averages legend: red – 200 week, blue – 100 week, yellow – 50 week On the multiyear weekly chart, we see that after a good rally in 2016 MU stock continued this ascent in 2017 and by September managed to break past its late 2014 highs around the $36 mark. Through this lens, what has been missing for me in order to add to long positions in MU stock is some sort of a re-test of this previous horizontal technical resistance area so as to prove its worth as technical support. With last week’s drop, MU shares are now undergoing such a mean-reversion process which, however, could see lower prices still before a next rally. 
Click to Enlarge Moving averages legend: red – 200 day, blue – 100 day, yellow – 50 day On the daily chart, we see that MU stock last week fell back to the upper end of its up-trending channel and also managed to re-test its yellow 50-day simple moving average for the first time since the summer. From a momentum perspective MU stock could easily have more downside into the middle of this channel and toward its blue 100-day moving average in the $37 area, however given the stock’s popularity and the year-end dynamics of fund managers chasing stocks, it is possible that we see a next bullish reversal closer to the $40-$42 area. Bullish reversals such as the one i am now waiting for by MU stock offer wonderful opportunities for traders and investors to put on income trades for monthly or quarterly income.

                                 Email notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items. Missouri head coach Barry Odom watches his team play during a 51-14 loss to Auburn at Faurot Field on Sept. 23. (AP Photo/L.G. Patterson) Southeastern Conference football is not for the faint of heart. Patience is a rare trait among boosters, fans and athletics officials in the League of Champions. In the SEC, even a coach credited with elevating his program to new heights couldn’t survive last weekend despite never posting a losing record at Texas A&M. So if you believe patience is a virtue, there’s something heartwarming about Mizzou’s relationship with coach Barry Odom. In many top SEC football schools, some rabid boosters would already be plotting a way to push Odom out next year. At Mizzou, though, athletics director Jim Sterk is contemplating a premature contract extension for a coach with more losses than victories on his brief resume. A Mizzou source told the Post-Dispatch’s Dave Matter last week that Sterk and Odom have started to negotiate a contract extension. Considering that Odom still has three years left on the five-year contract he signed to take over after Gary Pinkel retired, it’s tremendously premature to rush into a contract extension with a coach who has lost 13 of his 24 games. In a season in which the SEC East was much weaker than usual, Odom rallied the Tigers to six consecutive victories to end the regular season and earn a crucial bowl bid. The cynics would point out that Mizzou has yet to beat a team with a winning record this year. Some critics would also downplay the victories because traditional SEC East powers Tennessee and Florida were atrocious. Nonetheless, Odom deserves credit for rallying his team and keeping it united after a disheartening 1-5 start. Odom deserves praise and a pat on the back for Mizzou’s strong finish. He’s trending in the right direction, but does he really deserve an extension so soon? How does he go from the hot seat a month ago to an extension? Some would argue that Odom needs the extension to silence opposing recruiters who might tell recruits there’s no guarantee that a coach with only three years remaining on his contract will be there for all four years of their careers. • MORE ORTIZ: Columns, blogs, videos If an opposing coach can dissuade a kid from attending Mizzou because Odom has only three years left on his contract, you can bet the Tigers had no chance with that kid anyway. If you’re a five-star or four-star recruit deciding between playing for Nick Saban at Alabama or Odom at Mizzou, you’re not going to pick Odom because he has four years left on his deal instead of three. If you’re a stud who wants to play SEC home games in front of 100,000 fans, you’re not going to consider whether Odom has three or four years left on his contract because you would have already eliminated Mizzou’s cozy stadium. Alabama, Louisiana State, Tennessee and Texas A&M, after all, are the only SEC schools with stadiums that seat more than 100,000. According to 247sports.com, Mizzou’s 2018 recruiting class currently ranks 12th in the SEC, ahead of only Ole Miss and Arkansas. Odom’s 2018 recruiting class is ranked 54th in the country by 247sports.com, just behind Cincinnati and ahead of the University of South Florida. If you cannot land a better recruiting class than South Florida, do you really think an extension is going to improve the recruiting trend? • NEWSLETTER: Sign up for 'Ortiz Kicks' Florida, which just stole coach Dan Mullen from Mississippi State last week, has the third-ranked recruiting class in the SEC. Texas A&M has the fourth-best recruiting class in the SEC, even though recently fired Kevin Sumlin secured all those commitments at a time when opposing teams highlighted the reports that he would likely be fired this season. Sumlin is a good example of the risks schools take when they extend a coach too early. Four years ago, Texas A&M rushed to redo his contract after his second regular season. He signed a six-year, $30 million contract in December 2013. At least in his case he was 11-2 in his first season at A&M in 2012 and then a solid 8-4 at the time of his extension. He finished that 2013 season 9-4 after winning the Chick-fil-A Bowl. Sumlin followed that up with three consecutive 8-5 seasons before the Aggies decided that this 7-5 campaign was the end. Sumlin was fired last Sunday. He received a very nice consolation prize, though, in the form of a $10.5 million buyout. Therein lies the risk of extending a coach too soon. Granted, 8-5 records and annual bowl appearances might not have gotten Sumlin fired at Mizzou, where Odom was 4-8 in his first season last year. Sterk had no interest in publicly discussing the risks and rewards associated with extending a football coach too soon. Through a Mizzou spokesman, he declined to discuss the perils and rewards of extending Odom with three years still on his contract. Surely, he must have seen all the recent examples of the perils of bad contracts. Florida is paying Jim McElwain, who was fired last month, a $7.5 million buyout. They also are still paying the buyout they owe former coach Will Muschamp, who now coaches South Carolina. Arkansas owes Bret Bielema an $11.5 million buyout. According to the Arizona Republic, Arizona State owed Todd Graham a $12 million buyout after they fired him last week. That’s the price of doing business these days in big-time college football. Nonetheless, Sterk and Mizzou would be wise to wait to extend Odom until he puts together more than one winning season or at least beats a few winning teams in a season. Insight on local and national sports from columnist Jose de Jesus Ortiz.  Tigers (7-5) and Longhorns (6-6) play Dec. 27. It will be the Mizzou's first bowl appearance since Gary Pinkel’s 2014 team beat Minnesota in the Citrus Bowl on Jan. 1, 2015.

With Liberty Bowl possibly off the table, Tigers could be headed to Houston, Charlotte or Jacksonville.  With Liberty Bowl possibly off the table, Tigers could be headed to Houston, Charlotte or Jacksonville.

Sumlin was fired last Sunday. He received a very nice consolation prize, though, in the form of a $10.5 million buyout. Therein lies the risk of extending a coach too soon. Granted, 8-5 records and annual bowl appearances might not have gotten Sumlin fired at Mizzou, where Odom was 4-8 in his first season last year. Sterk had no interest in publicly discussing the risks and rewards associated with extending a football coach too soon. Through a Mizzou spokesman, he declined to discuss the perils and rewards of extending Odom with three years still on his contract. Surely, he must have seen all the recent examples of the perils of bad contracts. Florida is paying Jim McElwain, who was fired last month, a $7.5 million buyout. They also are still paying the buyout they owe former coach Will Muschamp, who now coaches South Carolina. Arkansas owes Bret Bielema an $11.5 million buyout. According to the Arizona Republic, Arizona State owed Todd Graham a $12 million buyout after they fired him last week. That’s the price of doing business these days in big-time college football. Nonetheless, Sterk and Mizzou would be wise to wait to extend Odom until he puts together more than one winning season or at least beats a few winning teams in a season. Insight on local and national sports from columnist Jose de Jesus Ortiz.  Tigers (7-5) and Longhorns (6-6) play Dec. 27. It will be the Mizzou's first bowl appearance since Gary Pinkel’s 2014 team beat Minnesota in the Citrus Bowl on Jan. 1, 2015.

With Liberty Bowl possibly off the table, Tigers could be headed to Houston, Charlotte or Jacksonville.  With Liberty Bowl possibly off the table, Tigers could be headed to Houston, Charlotte or Jacksonville.

What started as a bet on Twitter by Tesla CEO Elon Musk is now a massive battery storing and dispatching power for South Australia. After blackouts darkened the entire region in 2016, the government needed a fix. Past solutions, such as natural gas “peaker” plants that spin up during periods of high demand, can take years and hundreds of millions of dollars to build. Lithium-ion batteries, now at the price and scale to back up entire power grids, were an obvious answer. In March, Musk offered a money-back guarantee on Twitter that Tesla could get a 100 megawatts of power capacity up and running within 100 days. Tesla will get the system installed and working 100 days from contract signature or it is free. That serious enough for you? — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 10, 2017 And so, nearly nine months later, it was ready. Today (Dec. 1) the Hornsdale Power Reserve battery system, connected to a nearby wind farm run, was officially turned on for the first time (it started supplying power yesterday, as hot weather increased demand). The battery array holds enough energy to supply more than 30,000 homes for about an hour in an emergency, and supply electricity during other periods. This is just the latest in a string of project by Tesla and others around the world deploying massive grid-scale batteries. Altagas, AES and Tesla deployed huge battery storage projects in Southern California this year in the wake of 2015 natural gas leak. Tesla built an emergency solar and battery system in Puerto Rico after a hurricane knocked out power to much of the island this year. Hawaii, New Zealand, UK and Pacific islands have all seen new systems come on line as well. Despite these achievements, battery makers face a feast or famine challenge in the utility storage market. With residential and commercial business small (but growing), quarterly revenues from battery storage markets gyrate along with the calls to patch holes in ailing grids, reports Greentech Media. That makes it hard to build a business. “You cannot have a business model that’s just waiting for these events to occur so you can jump in and be a savior,” said Ravi Manghani, energy storage director at GTM Research. What’s needed is a change in mindset and a change in markets. First, utility operators are still warming up to the idea (and price tag) of adding batteries to their electrical grids. Before now, batteries were only seen as a solution in extreme circumstances. That’s not the case anymore, John Zahurancik, AES’s president of battery storage, told Bloomberg. “This is my fifth time doing the largest project in the world for energy storage, and each time people tell me, ‘Well this is the test, this is really the test,’” he said in January. “The next big test is how do we scale this up broadly.” Price stands in the way. The economics of fossil-fuel peaker plants still edge out batteries in some cases. But that won’t last, as prices for renewable energy and battery storage continue their free-fall: lithium-ion batteries are just about half their price in 2014. The duo is expected to be cost competitive by 2025 by providing back-up power and services such as balancing the amount of electricity on electrical grids. Designing markets that pay for such services is another factor. The US, and other countries, have a mix of regulated electric markets (Texas, South Australia), and deregulated ones (California and others) where wholesale energy providers can bid on the supply of the cheapest, most reliable energy. Once more regulators embrace battery integration, allowing them to compete equally with legacy fuels, the economics of renewables plus storage should grow even more attractive.  Already, more than 95% of new energy-storage deployments in 2015 were lithium-ion technologies. Tesla, LG Chem, Panasonic (a Tesla partner), Mitsubishi, Samsung and many, many others are now positioning themselves to be the next generation of suppliers. Tesla is proving to be one of the biggest risk-takers by staking out huge projects like the one in Australia, and building out a massive internal demand for its own batteries through Tesla vehicles. Tesla, which dropped the word “motors” from its name earlier this year, told investors in May that its energy storage business is already scaling “several times” faster than its car line. The company expects to produce 15 gigawatt hours of battery storage a year in the 2020s. “We are an energy innovation company as much as a car company,” said Tesla CTO JB Straubel.

Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) is an interesting player in the Consumer Goods space, with a focus on Auto Manufacturers – Major. The stock has been active on the tape, currently trading at $308.85, up from yesterday’s close by 0.43%. Given the stock’s recent action, it seemed like a good time to take a closer look at the company’s recent data.

For TSLA, the company currently has $3.67 Billion of cash on the books, which is offset by $441.72 Million current liabilities. You can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $-4.88 Billion over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to grow in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $-3.07 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 58.99% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors. Technical Analysis No analysis is ever complete without a thorough survey of a stock’s technical behavior. Looking at the stock’s movement on the chart, Tesla, Inc. recorded a 52-week high of $389.61. It is now trading 80.76% off that level.

That suggests something of the likelihood of a short squeeze in shares of TSLA.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk recently commented that short-sellers are “jerks who want us to die,” so now apparently, JPMorgan analysts are acting like jerks. They advise investors to short Tesla Inc stock because it’s set to plunge 40% over the next year. In a note on Friday, JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman advised investors to short Tesla stock and bet against the company because he expects it to disappoint further on the Model 3 ramp. He noted that 2018 brings a number of important milestones for ramping production of the Model 3, and he believes Tesla will struggle to meet those milestones, especially based on “its substantial miss to volume targets in 2017.” Competition is also a key part of his advice to short Tesla stock. Brinkman expects competition from traditional automakers to become more of a threat as they start looking for ways to benefit from government subsidies. He’s particularly concerned about competitors that price their electric vehicles without even intending to turn a profit on them. The concern is that traditional automakers may simply aim to sell enough EVs to subsidize the rest of their vehicle portfolios—cars, trucks and SUVs with internal combustion engines—”from a legal and regulatory compliance perspective.” Brinkman questions how Tesla can manage an EBIT margin that’s even at the industry average while trying to compete with EVs that are priced for losses. He rates Tesla stock at Underweight with a price target of $185, which suggests 40% downside. Another issue Tesla will most likely face next year is the end of the federal tax credit for U.S. buyers. The tax credit is complex because it begins to phase out after the company delivers its 200,000th vehicle. Those who take delivery of their Tesla starting at the beginning of the quarter after the quarter in which Tesla delivers car #200,000 won’t get the full $7,500 credit. Because of how the company does things, it will start getting tricky for buyers to know how much of a tax credit they will be eligible for before they take delivery of their Tesla. This is an even bigger issue for the more affordable Model 3 because it targets a more price-conscious buyer than the Model S or Model X. The advice to short Tesla stock may seem like a bold call even for those who are bearish on the automaker. Betting against it directly hasn’t been turning out very well for short-sellers, even though it comes up short of expectations or timelines regularly. Some analysts who are bearish still don’t advise clients to short Tesla stock. However, there have been plenty of others who aren’t afraid to bet against the EV maker. For example, well-known short-seller Jim Chanos said last month that he has been adding to his short all year. Tesla stock has been a momentum play that keeps inflicting pain on short-sellers, although this could be changing. Even though the stock is in the green year to date, it has plunged since September, losing one-fifth of its value since its record high then, according to CNBC. Data from financial analytics firm S3 Partners indicates that Tesla shorts have recovered $890 million of what they’ve lost on their positions.

https://qz.com/1143177/someone-built-a-cryptocurrency-mine-in-the-trunk-of-a-tesla-tsla/

The cryptocurrency craze has gotten so hot that at least one Tesla owner has apparently fitted a mining rig to their car to make some money, a photo from EcoMotoring News show. The photo shows 16 graphics cards mounted on four motherboards, according to Vice. Graphics cards are used to mine cryptocurrencies like ethereum; mining bitcoin requires specialized chips called ASICS, or application-specific integrated circuits. The logic of building a cryptocurrency mine in the trunk of a Tesla goes like this: Because a major cost of mining is the price of electricity, a miner would be able to boost profitability by getting free power. That’s what many public electric vehicle charging stations offer. Tesla’s network of Superchargers offer unlimited free electricity to customers who bought a car before January 2016, and offer 400 kWh of free electricity each year to everyone else. But, as Vice points out, there are a few things that make mining out of the back of a Tesla unfeasible. For instance, the waste heat generated by the miners would make the vehicle uncomfortably hot. Vice’s Daniel Oberhaus crunched the numbers on the rig, and found that Tesla owners on the limited electricity program could only run their rigs for seven days a year. However, it appears that running a mining rig for ether would actually help a Tesla owner break even on the cost of leasing a Tesla Model S—but only if the owner never drove it anywhere.

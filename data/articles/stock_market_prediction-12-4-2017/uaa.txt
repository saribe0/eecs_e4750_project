ANCHORAGE, Alaska (KTUU) - Dimond High School’s Jahnna Hajdukovich on Monday held the ceremonial signing of her National Letter of Intent to play women's basketball at UAA. Basketball is the name of the game in the Hajdukovich family-- her father Jim Hajdukovich played for the Seawolves men’s team from 1995 to 1999. “My dad is in the hall of fame there (UAA), and has some records I'm hoping to break,” said Jahnna Monday. “That's the goal anyways, but that's not the only reason I went there.” It’s easy to see why the Dimond senior would want to join a program that is currently ranked second in the nation for NCAA Div. II women’s basketball, and just won its seventh Great Alaska Shootout title. "It's definitely intimidating, but I can't wait to jump into it,” said Hajdukovich. “I can't wait to contribute, and be a part of the program.” It’s also simple to see why UAA showed interest in Hajdukovich as well.   Her prep hoops resume includes being named to the all-state tournament team twice, and averaging 12.3 points per game at state.  The senior guard has just one thing missing from her resume: “I really want to be a state champ, that is my ultimate goal, and I think that me signing really gives me individual focus to help the team (Dimond).”

ANCHORAGE, Alaska (KTUU) - Numbers from the state show the health care industry is projected to continue as one of the top areas for job growth through 2024. While job growth is good, some in the nursing field say meeting the demand for registered nurses can be challenging. As students at University of Alaska Anchorage's School of Nursing are learning how to work with patients, it's knowledge upcoming graduates aim to put to good use in the work force. Christina Egger says her hope is to work at Alaska Native Medical Center in one of their critical care departments. She loves what she's learning.  "I love that it's always changing and the group of people that I'm working with are supportive and helpful and they really encourage me to do my best, and interaction with the patients and talking to people every day and seeing different cases," Egger said. Danielle Carlson hopes to work in Providence hospital's pediatric ICU, and says nurses play an important role in patient care. "We are one-on-one with that patient the most amount of time during the day and we get to know their personalities, we see them at their worst and we see them at their best," Carlson said. Arylis Scates said his goal is to work with Alaska Regional Hospital. Scates said it takes a lot of work and commitment to become a nurse.  "I think nursing in general is difficult," Scates said. "Getting your license is a difficult thing to get, it takes a lot of work a lot of time into it. It's not something that you can just go to school and passively work your way through you know, 'Cs get degrees,' kind of thing, it takes effort," Scates said. The demand for nurses is expected to grow over the next seven years, according to Marianne Murray, director for UAA's School of Nursing. "With our population getting older, we have a lot more need for sometimes high delivery of care into our outreach areas and long-term care facilities, which also require nursing care," Murray said. "Some of our nurses are getting older so from the projections it looks like we'll have about 5-6 percent of our nurses retire, so we also have to fill those needs as the nurses retire ."  Murray said there are some specific areas of need. "Our small rural areas where we have our critical access hospitals, some of them are staffed with a lot of traveling nurses or nurses from other states because we don't have the Alaskan graduates to actually fill the spots," Murray said. "Another kind of need for nursing is specific nursing roles such as behavioral health nurses, nurses in I.C.U., E.R., those kind of areas." While it may not be for everyone, for those who have the passion, it's a field with promising career prospects.

FAIRBANKS — The University of Alaska Fairbanks men’s and women’s Nordic ski team fell to in-state rival Alaska Anchorage in the 14th annual Nordic Cup on Sunday afternoon at Hatcher’s Pass.  UAA finished the two-day event in 4 hours, 49 minutes and 49.4 seconds, while UAF posted a total time of 4:56:10.5. On Sunday, the Seawolves’ mixed gender relay team of Marte Hakenstad-Braten, Hailey Swirbull, Tracen Knopp and Toomas Kollo won the 4x5-kilometer relay in 1:04:42.8 at the independence Mine Trails. The Nanooks’ mixed gender relay team consisting of Anna Darnell, Ann-Cathrin Uhl, Jan Cech and Arnaud Guyon took second, finishing the event in 1:04:59.5 Alaska Anchorage also finished third in 1:06:21.0, though Alaska’s second relay team, which features Anja Maijala, Hannah Dueling, Seiji Takagi and Max Donaldson, took fourth in 1:06:28.7.

The Seawolves’ top men’s team captured first in the 10km with a time of 88:23.6, while the Nanooks’ top squad finished in 88:50.4. Anchorage’s top three women tallied a time of 70:22.0 in the 7.5km, and Alaska’s completed the course in 75:51.9. “I’ve got to give credit to UAA and their coaching staff because they have a much stronger team than what we’ve faced in recent years, especially on the women’s side,” Nanooks head coach Nick Crawford said Saturday in UAF news release. “Their last two years of recruiting have been very successful and I expect that they’ll have a very good season ahead.” Alaska’s men were led by redshirt senior Jan Cech, who took second among college skiers and third overall with a time of 20:19.5. Senior Seiji Takagi (29:41.0) finished fifth overall and classmate Alexander Eckert (29:49.9) captured seventh.

A last-minute layup set the Seawolves' 59-53 win over Tulsa. The Seawolves tipped off against the Tulsa Golden Hurricane Thursday afternoon, after defeating Maryland Eastern Shore on Tuesday.

Polk ANCHORAGE, Alaska — Alaska-Anchorage outscored Tulsa 14-2 in the final 4 minutes, 10 seconds Thursday to pull out a 59-53 victory over the Golden Hurricane in the 40th annual Great Alaska Shootout at the Alaska Airlines Center. Crystal Polk led TU (3-3) with 12 points, Kendrian Elliott added 11, and Shug Dickson had 10 points and a team-best nine rebounds and four assists. Dickson and Polk were named to the all-tournament team. The Hurricane still led by one, 51-50, when Dickson scored but was called for an offensive foul. Coach Matilda Mossman said that was the turning point in the game. “It came down to the charge call at the 1:26 mark,” Mossman said. “We had a one-point lead, Shug (Dickson) makes a basket but is called for the foul, and Alaska-Anchorage finishes with a 9-2 run. “I am proud of the way we weathered the storm when we were down 11, but UAA played really hard and played with urgency in the end.” There were eight lead change and seven ties. Alaska-Anchorage (7-0), ranked No. 2 in NCAA Division II, was led by Hannah Wandersee with 14 points. Tulsa will return to action at 7 p.m. Wednesday against Oral Roberts in the Mayor’s Cup game at the Donald W. Reynolds Center.

 The rivalry showdown between the UAF and UAA men's basketball teams was dominated by the Seawolves on Tuesday night.  UAA forward Jacob Lampkin racked up 22 points and 10 rebounds for a double-double – his sixth of the season – and the Seawolves cruised passed the Nanooks 65-39 to open Great Northwest Athletic Conference play at the Alaska Airlines Center.  The Seawolves went on a 14-0 run early in the first half to take a 16-3 lead and they led by double figures the rest of the way.  UAA's big lead allowed the Seawolves to play their bench for extended minutes. Eleven Seawolves logged double-digit minutes and 11 scored.  Senior guard Maleke Haynes registered six points and dished five assists and junior guard/forward Josiah Wood chipped in nine points for UAA.  "We got some big contributions all up and down the lineup," UAA coach Rusty Osborne said. "The good thing is we didn't have to extend minutes on anybody."  Junior forward Alex Baham paced the Nanooks with 10 points, junior forward Joe Lendway added eight points and nine rebounds and sophomore foward Michael Kluting, of Palmer, recorded four points and seven boards.  Despite UAA's big lead from start to finish, Osborne said he wasn't happy with UAA's "lethargic" offense and 10 turnovers in the first half.  "We've gotta get better," he said."There's teams in our league that have a lot more firepower than us.  "We're gonna have to get some consistent scorers other than Jacob."  Lampkin has led UAA (5-4) in scoring in four games and rebounding in eight. He leads UAA with 15 points per game. UAA's second leading scorer, D.J. Ursery (10.7 ppg), scored six points Tuesday.  UAA's biggest contributor off the bench was sophomore Jack Macdonald, a 6-foot guard from Melbourne, Australia, who tallied six points, three assists and two steals in 19 minutes.  Osborne said the Nanooks (2-5) looked tired from a week-long road trip – they split a pair of games in Bellingham, Washington, before coming to Anchorage – and he said they will be a tougher team on the road later this season.  UAA outshot the Nanooks 51.1 percent to 30 percent – UAF's worst offensive output in 102 total meetings between the teams. In the first half, UAF shot 21.7 percent and UAA led 29-13 at halftime.  "Lucky for us, you could tell that Fairbanks was really tired," Osborne said. "They (missed) some shots they normally make in the first half."  The win extended UAA's streak in the rivalry to seven games.  The Seawolves stay home for their ninth straight game Thursday against undefeated Montana State-Billings. UAF will play Billings on Saturday in Fairbanks.  It's set to be a defensive battle with UAA and Billings boasting the top two scoring defenses in the GNAC. UAA is allowing a conference-low 62.2 points per game and Billings is allowing 64.2.  "Winning breeds confidence and they're 5-0 and they've had some success on the road," Osborne said. "Our staff tonight will be hammering the film, the scouts and all that stuff and getting ready for a team that's coming in with a ton of confidence."

UAF’s Amenofis Mitchell, shown against Holy Names on Nov. 21 at the UAF Patty Center, had six points at UAA Tuesday.  Eric Engman/News-Miner FAIRBANKS — For the Alaska Nanooks, Tuesday night’s experience in the Alaska Airlines Center seemed to be the basketball equivalent of trying to climb Denali with a jump rope. The Nanooks seemed to labor offensively against the host University of Alaska Anchorage Seawolves, and they lost 65-39 in the Great Northwest Athletic Conference opener for both men’s basketball teams. The game was broadcast on GCI Cable Channels 1 and 907. The Nanooks, 2-5 overall and 0-1 in the 11-team NCAA Division II conference, led 3-2 early in the game. The Seawolves snatched a 4-3 lead and never looked back on the way to winning for the 80th time in the 102nd meeting between the intrastate rivals. “As bad as it was, we gave them 65 points but we couldn’t make layups, we couldn’t make free throws, we turned it over 21 times. I think that’s kind of the mark for disaster,’’ Nanooks head coach Mick Durham said from Anchorage. Tuesday’s lopsided outcome also was the host team’s 15th straight win in Anchorage against the visitors from the University of Alaska, Fairbanks. It was the Seawolves seventh straight victory in the series since the Nanooks’ last win over UAA, a 70-68 triumph in a regular season-ending game on Feb. 27, 2014 at the UAF Patty Center. The Nanooks, despite the tough loss, were tough in rebounding. The Nanooks outworked the Seawolves on the boards 33-28, with a 12-4 advantage in offensive rebounds. “We outrebounded, but it was a disaster offensively,’’ Durham said. “I guess we have to build on those things.” The Nanooks struggled in field-goal shooting, going 15 for 50 for 30-percent efficiency. The Seawolves were 51.1-percent efficient from the field with 23 of 45 shots. Both teams launched plenty of 3-point attempts. The Nanooks finished 7 for 24 (29.2 percent) from beyond the arc while  the Seawolves went 8 for 22 (36.4 percent). The Nanooks made only six visits to the free-throw line and connected on two attempts. UAA sank 11 of its 18 free throws. Turnovers also hurt the Nanooks for the second straight game. Against UAA, the Nanooks committed 21 miscues to the Seawolves’ 12.     The Nanooks had 19 turnovers in Saturday’s 80-56 loss to California San Diego in the Chuck Randall Thanksgiving Classic at GNAC rival Western Washington University in Bellingham, Washington. “The biggest disappointment for me (Tuesday) was 21 turnovers,’’ Durham said. “We made it an issue the last couple of days (in practice).” After the Nanooks’ 3-2 lead Tuesday, the Seawolves went on a 14-0 run by the 11:30 mark of the first quarter.  The Nanooks ended the first half in a 29-13 hole. Alex Baham, whose hometown of Wasilla is about 40 miles from the UAA campus, scored Nanooks’ last points of the half with a 3-point shot from the left wing with about 29 seconds on the scoreboard clock. Seawolves junior guard Josiah Wood had drained a trey about 13 seconds earlier to put UAA ahead 29-10. Baham, who transferred to UAF from Peninsula College in Port Angeles, Washington, and Seawolves senior forward Jacob Lampkin were the only players in the game to record double-figure points. Baham scored 10 points on 3-for-4 shooting from the field and a 1-for-2 night at the line. Lampkin, a transfer to UAA from NCAA Division I University of the Pacific in Stockton, California, ended Tuesday’s contest with a game-high double-double of 22 points and 10 rebounds. Lampkin shot 9 for 10 from the field. The Nanooks got eight points and a team-best nine rebounds from the junior forward Joe Lendway. Junior guard Amenofis Mitchell contributed six points and three rebounds; senior forward LaDonovan Wilder provided five rebounds;  and junior guard Davis Kimble distributed a team-high four assists for the Nanooks. Wood contributed nine points for the Seawolves and senior guard Maleke Haynes had a game-high five assists to go with six points. The Nanooks have four days to get ready for their next GNAC opponent, Montana State Billings. The Yellowjackets, who are 5-0 overall, visit the UAF Patty Center at 7:30 p.m. Saturday.

U.S. stocks fell sharply and Treasury prices rose after ABC news reported that former U.S. National Security Advisor Michael Flynn is prepared to testify that President Donald Trump directed him to make contact with Russians when he was a presidential candidate. Separately, federal prosecutors said Flynn pled guilty to lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and that he admitted to speaking with a top member of the Trump transition team regarding his communications with Russia’s ambassador to the United States. The White House issued a statement saying Flynn’s lying to the FBI implicates Flynn alone. (Source: TODAYonline) WALL STREET: The Standard & Poor’s 500 index fell 0.2 per cent to 2,642.22. The Dow Jones industrial average slid 0.2 per cent to 24,231.59 and the Nasdaq composite lost 0.4 per cent to 6,847.59. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks gave up 0.5 per cent, to 1,537.02. OIL: Benchmark U.S. crude fell 41 cents to $57.95 per barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract rose 96 cents, or 1.7 per cent, to settle at $58.36 a barrel on Friday. Brent, the international standard, lost 39 cents to $63.34 per barrel in London. It added $1.10, or 1.8 per cent, to close at $63.73 a barrel on Friday. Top Pick for Monday: Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT) Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT) has grabbed attention from the analysts when it experienced a change of 0.12% in the last trading session to close at $97.35. A total of 8,294,047 shares exchanged hands during the intra-day trade contrast with its average trading volume of 9.23M shares, while its relative volume stands at 0.90. Relative volume is the comparison of current volume to average volume for the same time of day, and it’s displayed as a ratio. If RVOL is less than 1 it is not In Play on this trading day and Investors may decide not to trade it.  If RVOL is above 2 it is In Play and this is more evidence Investors ought to be in the name.  When stocks are *very* In Play one can see a RVOL of 5 and above.  The higher the RVOL the more In Play the stock is. Day traders strive to make money by exploiting minute price movements in individual assets (usually stocks, though currencies, futures, and options are traded as well), usually leveraging large amounts of capital to do so, therefore they trade on Stocks in Play. In Play Stocks are volatile enough to produce good risk and reward trading opportunities for both bull and bear traders intraday. Most company stocks have very little volatility. They generally move extremely slowly and they only produce big price swings when the company produces good or bad trading results, which may only happen a couple of times a year at best. In deciding what to focus on – in a stock, say – a typical day trader looks for three things: liquidity, volatility and trading volume. Liquidity allows an investor to enter and exit a stock at a good price (i.e. tight spreads, or the difference between the bid and ask price of a stock, and low slippage, or the difference between the predictable price of a trade and the actual price). If a stock does not have good liquidity then it may take some time before a broker is able to negotiate a deal to buy or sell a stock and the broker may not be able to get the sell or buy price that the trader is looking for. This is a problem for day traders and it could mean the difference between a profitable and non-profitable trade. Traders have different rules for what constitutes liquidity and a good guide is the volume of trades and volume of shares that are traded each day. 100,000 shares traded per day would be a minimum for most traders and some require 1,000,000. Trading volume is a gauge of how many times a stock is bought and sold in a given time period (most commonly, within a day of trading, known as the average daily trading volume – ADTV). A high degree of volume indicates a lot of interest in a stock. Often, a boost in the volume of a stock is a harbinger of a price jump, either up or down. Volatility is simply a measure of the predictable daily price range—the range in which a day trader operates. More volatility means greater profit or loss. After a recent check, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT) stock is found to be 1.50% volatile for the week, while 1.64% volatility is recorded for the month. Technical’s Snapshot: The stock has a market cap of $291.79B and the number of outstanding shares has been calculated 3.00B. Based on a recent bid, its distance from 20 days simple moving average is 4.02%, and its distance from 50 days simple moving average is 11.12% while it has a distance of 23.49% from the 200 days simple moving average. The company’s distance from 52-week high price is -2.78% and the current price is 49.13% away from 52-week low price. The company has Relative Strength Index (RSI 14) of 71.69 together with Average True Range (ATR 14) of 1.68. Stock’s Valuation: Past 5 years growth of WMT observed at -0.60%, and for the next five years the analysts that follow this company is expecting its growth at 5.80%. The stock’s price to sales ratio for trailing twelve months is 0.59 and price to book ratio for the most recent quarter is 3.83, whereas price to cash per share for the most recent quarter are 45.11. Its quick ratio for the most recent quarter is 0.20. Analysts mean recommendation for the stock is 2.40. This number is based on a 1 to 5 scale where 1 indicates a Strong Buy recommendation while 5 represents a Strong Sell.

https://economicsandmoney.com/2017/11/30/the-bull-case-for-wal-mart-stores-inc-wmt-3/

Most of the investors recently have been curious over the performance of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) stock. Analysts often use price and volume data to predict future stock performance. In the case of WMT, the chart has some interesting things to say about where the stock might be headed. How has the stock performed recently? Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) in the last month has increased +11.74%. Shares are now up over the past year, outperforming the broad market by -100% and outperformed a peer group of similar companies by 316%. After the latest session, which saw the stock close at a price of $97.56, WMT sits below its 52-week high. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has been trading in a bullish manner, based on the relative positions of the stock’s 20 and 200 day moving averages. Momentum indicators 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that WMT may be headed in the future. To forecast a stock’s future performance, analysts use momentum indicators, which take into account the size and speed of these price movements. As momentum begins to slow, it may be a sign that a recent trend is about to reverse. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for WMT is 71.19%, which suggests that the stock may be primed for a trend reversal or a corrective pullback in price. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 76.68%, tells a similar story, and suggests that WMT currently trades in overbought territory. What do the trading volumes reveal? Price isn’t the only tool analysts use to forecast future performance. Volume patterns can also reveal some important insights. If, for instance, a stock’s volumes suddenly increase by a significant amount, it’s usually a sign that the level of conviction behind the trade is high. Investors may feel very strongly about the future direction of the stock in question. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) average trading volume of 10,492,370 during the past month is 17.57% above its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been more active than usual in the stock in recent times. What do the analysts think? WMT is currently undervalued by -2.38% relative to the average 1-year price target of $99.94 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 2.40, which implies that analysts are generally neutral in their outlook for WMT over the next year. How risky is the stock?  When predicting the future performance for a stock, it’s also important to take into account risk. To do this, analysts often use a stock’s beta, which measures the stock’s volatility relative to the overall market. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has a beta of 0.34, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are less extreme than the market as a whole. WMT therefore has a below average level of market risk. During the past couple of weeks, WMT average daily volatility was 44.68%, which is -22.17 percentage points higher than the average volatility over the past 100 days.

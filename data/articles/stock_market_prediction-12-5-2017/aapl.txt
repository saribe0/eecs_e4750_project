Apple reached an agreement with the European Union today (Dec. 5) to begin paying €13 billion ($15.46 billion) to the Irish government. That’s 5.9% of the tech giant’s total cash pile as of August 2017, when it reported reserves of $261.5 billion. The agreement suggests that the European Union is slowly winning a long dispute it has held with Apple and Ireland. Since the early nineties, Apple has enjoyed an agreement with Ireland that requires it to pay tax rates as low as 0.005%, which originated as part of Ireland’s attempt to spur foreign investment. The European Union, however, has argued the arrangement is a sweetheart deal that has allowed Apple to dodge taxes in other EU member states, by funnelling profits over to two Irish subsidiary companies. In 2016, the European Commission ruled that the arrangement is “illegal under EU state aid rules.” Both Ireland and Apple have dragged their feet on complying with the ruling. Apple CEO Tim Cook called it “total political crap,” and both Apple and Ireland have appealed it. In October, the European Commission took the case to the European Court of Justice, the EU’s highest judiciary body, in hopes of coercing Apple and Ireland to cooperate. Despite today’s agreement, Apple’s appeal remains in process, and its tax payments to Ireland will remain in escrow until that’s exhausted. “We have a dedicated team working diligently and expeditiously with Ireland on the process the European Commission has mandated. We remain confident the General Court of the EU will overturn the Commission’s decision once it has reviewed all the evidence,” Apple told the Wall Street Journal (paywall).

 Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) and its Ireland-based subsidiary were slapped with a $14.5 billion penalty last year related to an alleged sweetheart tax deal that the U.S. firm received from the government of Ireland. After a relatively brief argument with the European Commission (EC), Ireland and Apple agreed that the company would set up an escrow account in Ireland and pay the $14.5 billion into the account pending the outcome of appeals against the EC ruling. Maybe Ireland and Apple hoped everyone would forget about the escrow account because until Monday morning, not much was heard about it. This morning came a report that Apple and the Irish government have agreed on terms to fund an escrow account for the alleged back tax bill. Apple’s payments would begin in the first quarter of next year. The EC had to prod Ireland in October with a referral to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) before the government would get off the dime. Ireland’s finance minister meets Monday with the EC’s antitrust leader to brief her on the deal. The EC indicated that it will only close the ECJ proceedings when Ireland recovers the full amount due from Apple. The EC’s 2016 decision is based on its determination that Apple received a favorable — and illegal — Irish tax ruling in 1991 that set the company’s tax rate in Ireland at just 0.005% on profits the company earned between 1991 and 2007. The EC’s ruling gave Ireland until January 3, 2017 to recover the funds. The core of the dispute concerns tax rulings, issued by Ireland to Apple in 1991 and 2007, which provided that income related to intellectual property rights held by Apple Sales International (ASI), an Irish registered non-resident company, were not taxable in Ireland. The theory advanced by Apple is that the intellectual property rights were held by the company’s “head office” in the United States. In the EC’s view, these amounts were taxable in Ireland as there was no “head office” capable of managing the intellectual property rights. Thus, the income must be attributed to the Irish branch. The EC also argued that the Irish tax rulings understated profits properly attributable to activities carried out in Ireland. Both Apple and Ireland have appealed the EC ruling to the European Union’s General Court. By Paul Ausick

Back in October, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL)’s iPhone X sold out within 10 minutes of opening preorder sales. Now, a little more than a month later, finding the shelved product is equally challenging, but online fulfillment is improving. Loup Ventures managing partner Gene Munster is bullish on Apple but does not issue ratings or price targets. The iPhone X has seen online lead times accelerate from 10.1 days to 7.7 days, even as in-store availability has fallen from about 16 percent to 7 percent, according to Loup research. The product has remained in relative short supply since its release, ranging from 2 percent in-store availability in the days before Thanksgiving to 26 percent the following days. “We anticipate iPhone X lead times of more than four days to continue for the balance of 2017 and expect the iPhone X to reach supply demand equilibrium sometime in January,” Munster wrote in a Monday post. “That’s a slight positive for the outlook for Apple’s Mar-18 quarter.” When the iPhone X was first released, Munster reported long online lead times and store lines more than double his expectations, signaling product demand exceeding that of the company’s previous three models and bolstering forecasts for average selling price. At the time of publication, Apple was trading marginally higher at $171.56. Related Links: Apple Must Show What's Next After iPhone X The Cost Of Cracking An Apple iPhone X Photo courtesy of Apple.

Source: Shutterstock All is well in the Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) kingdom. That is why AAPL stock is trading at all-time highs. iPhone sales are on fire and the company is selling about as many phones as ever. Subdued iPhone 8 demand has been forgotten by investors, who are now focused on what analysts are dubbing “super-charged” demand for Apple’s latest and greatest, the iPhone X. iPad sales are also on fire. Apple’s iPad segment has posted positive unit and revenue growth in back-to-back quarters, ending a multi-quarter run of declines. With iPad sales inflecting upward, it’s clear to see that the Apple is retaking tablet market shared from 2-in-1 devices. Apple Watch sales are also on fire. The Apple Watch has posted unit growth of over 50% for three consecutive quarters. Apple is clearly running away with the wearables/smart watch market. Mac sales are inflecting upward. After four straight quarters of declines in 2016, Mac sales have posted four straight quarters of gains in 2017. The high-margin Services segment is doing really well, with growth accelerating to 34% last quarter from 24% one year ago. Services revenue now accounts for over 16% of Apple’s total revenue, up from 13.5% a year ago. That is important, because it’s additive to the overall margin profile. With so much going right for Apple, what could stop AAPL stock? Failure for Apple to repeat its 2017 success in 2018. AAPL stock is an iPhone growth story, and right now, the iPhone growth story is all about super-charged demand for the iPhone X. But it actually looks like demand for the iPhone X isn’t as big as everyone thought — lead times are falling much more quickly than expected. Moreover, regardless of how big iPhone X demand is, it’s not repeatable next year. But AAPL stock is trading on the assumption that not only is iPhone X demand huge, but that huge iPhone demand is something that is going to hang around forever. It won’t. Smartphone demand cycles. Look at the iPhone 6 launch. Consequently, AAPL stock looks dangerous in 2018. Firstly, it’s worth noting that regardless of which way you want to spin the AAPL growth narrative, this is an iPhone-first story. iPhone sales accounted for over half of total revenues last quarter. That means there is a lot of pressure on iPhone sales to meet or exceed expectations. Secondly, AAPL stock is trading at its richest valuation in five years. The only other time AAPL stock was this richly valued over the past five years was in late 2014/early 2015 when investors were bidding up the stock on huge iPhone 6 expectations. That means there is a lot of pressure on iPhone X sales to meet or exceed expectations. Thirdly, even though the iPhone 6 was a huge hit and AAPL stock kept climbing higher in early 2015, AAPL stock started to crumble in mid-2015.  The market realized that huge demand for the iPhone 6 was a one-time thing. The success was not repeatable. Earnings estimates came down. The valuation fell. And AAPL stock tumbled from $130 to $90 in a year.

http://www.nasdaq.com/article/interesting-january-2018-stock-options-for-aapl-cm886368

Consistently, one of the more popular stocks people enter into their stock options watchlist at Stock Options Channel is Apple Inc (Symbol: AAPL). So this week we highlight one interesting put contract, and one interesting call contract, from the January 2018 expiration for AAPL. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting, is at the $165 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $2.60. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 1.6% return against the $165 commitment, or a 12.5% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost ).      Turning to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the January 2018 expiration, for shareholders of Apple Inc (Symbol: AAPL) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 1.5% annualized dividend yield. Selling the covered call at the $175 strike and collecting the premium based on the $3.40 bid, annualizes to an additional 15.8% rate of return against the current stock price (this is what we at Stock Options Channel refer to as the YieldBoost ), for a total of 17.2% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $175 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but AAPL shares would have to advance 2.3% from current levels for that to happen, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 4.3% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.

Applied Materials (AMAT) is trading sharply lower today, so we looked back at what we wrote two weeks ago. At that juncture in the market, we said, "AMAT might close lower today after making a new high of $60.89. This might turn out to be a key reversal day, but it probably will not be the end of the bull story as the charts do not show a distribution or topping pattern. I would look for AMAT to trade sideways for a number of weeks." With some hindsight, we can see the high at $60.89 on Nov. 17 has remained the high. Today AMAT is trading below its nearby support level at $55. Normally the breaking of a nearby support level is not that crucial in as strong a bull market as we have been witnessing, but AMAT is also trading below its 50-day moving average line. AMAT traded below that line for much of August, but the rest of our favorite indicators were in better shape at that point in time.   In this updated daily bar chart, above, we can see AMAT is below the rising 50-day line and the next likely area of support (previous area of resistance) is the $48-$47 area -- the highs of June, July and September. The rising 200-day moving average line is still well below the market, around $45. In the past six weeks or so, the On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has been flat, telling us that buyers and sellers of AMAT were in balance. The price weakness today could mean the OBV line turns down. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator crossed to the downside in late October, generating a take-profits sell signal. The MACD oscillator is still pointed down in a bearish mode.   In this weekly bar chart of AMAT, above, only one indicator has deteriorated in the past two weeks. Prices are still above the rising 40-week moving average line. The weekly OBV line is still constructive. The MACD oscillator, however, has narrowed. In the next few weeks we may or may not see a bearish crossover of the two moving averages that comprise this indicator, but the histogram (the distance between the two averages) has already peaked.   In this Point and Figure chart of AMAT, above, we can see a column of O's to the downside. Prices have met a downside price target of $53.82, but we don't have a lot of reason to anticipate support nearby. The best area for support is in the mid-$40s, where there is heavy volume (the left side of the chart). Bottom line: Selloffs in the "hot" technology sector in the bull market this year have been relatively short and shallow, but the advance is older now than it was in January, so aging has to be considered. Keeping this in mind, we might be seeing the start of a pullback to the $47 area and a new consolidation pattern in the weeks ahead. Keep your powder dry.

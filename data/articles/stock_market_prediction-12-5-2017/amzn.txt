Valued currently at $1133.95, the vast majority of Wall Street analysts continue to say it’s worth buying.

https://stocknews.com/news/amzn-amazons-retail-jobs-are-growing-but-the-rest-of-retail/

AMZN – Amazon is destroying hundreds of thousands of traditional retail jobs, and its own headcount growth isn’t enough to make up for it. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is creating a lot of jobs, but the effects of its deflationary business are eliminating far more positions. That’s the conclusion from journalists at Quartz, whch recently looked at whether Amazon’s own job growth is enough to make up for heavy retail sector losses: Amazon’s headcount is growing by 40% year-over-year. It was the eighth-largest private employer in the US at the end of 2016, and it’s poised to climb those ranks quickly. The online retailer also announced plans to build a second US headquarters that will employ 50,000 employees. But Amazon’s growth comes at a cost. It has a well-earned reputation for overwhelming competitors. Even though Amazon represents a small portion of the overall retail industry, it dominates the industry’s sales growth. In all, the study found that about 170,000 retail sector jobs will be lost this year. Even if Amazon adds 146,000 employees — a staggering hiring spree, no doubt — it still will result in a net loss of around 24,000 jobs, Quartz said. This problem will be further compounded soon by Amazon’s increasing reliance on robots, the study notes. The company has 55,000 robots on staff today, with another 20,000 expected to be added in the fourth quarter of 2017 alone. That growth rate is expected to continue in coming years, and likely claim tens of thousands of more jobs along with it. In summary, Amazon is crushing the retail industry with its business model. That results in companies struggling, going out of business, and cutting jobs. But there’s also the robot problem, in which humans are being rapidly replaced by machines — and that might just be the most concerning issue of all. Amazon.com, Inc. shares fell $7.82 (-0.69%) in premarket trading Tuesday. Year-to-date, AMZN has gained 51.22%, versus a 19.85% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period. AMZN currently has a StockNews.com POWR Rating of A (Strong Buy), and is ranked #3 of 50 stocks in the Internet category.

http://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/european-union-blacklists-17-tax-havens-another-47-nations-on-grey-list/story-NNhhMYE8Li9GFnHA8K38oO.html

European Union ministers adopted on Tuesday a blacklist of 17 non-EU tax havens including Panama, South Korea and the United Arab Emirates after a year of tough negotiations. The Paradise Papers leak last month gave a new impetus to the plan, making public some of the intricate ways the world’s rich evade tax using offshore havens. “We have adopted at EU level a list of states which are not doing enough to fight tax evasion. This blacklist includes 17 states,” French finance minister Bruno Le Maire told reporters in Brussels. The EU has struggled for over a year to finalise the blacklist, with smaller, low-tax EU nations such as Ireland, Malta and Luxembourg worried about scaring off multinationals. The countries on the list are: American Samoa, Bahrain, Barbados, Grenada, Guam, Macau, the Marshall Islands, Mongolia, Namibia, Palau, Panama, Saint Lucia, Samoa, South Korea, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia and the United Arab Emirates. A further 47 countries are on a “grey list”, sources said. Other jurisdictions are understood to have been given leeway after suffering severe damage during hurricanes in the Caribbean earlier this year. Britain fought particularly hard against the list, afraid that its crown dependencies, including Jersey and the Virgin Islands, would be singled out. Senior officials from member states had whittled down an initial draft of 29 countries, with divisions still strong in recent days on who would make the final version. EU Economic Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said ahead of the official announcement that this was fewer than the 20 countries he had hoped for but would be a “initial victory”. Enforcement problem Enforcement is the biggest problem, with EU countries split over whether blacklisted countries should be subjected to financial sanctions or if the list itself is shaming enough. Several states, including France, support tough measures against the listed tax havens such as exclusion from EU and World Bank funding, though the debate is still open. Other countries are reluctant to draw up common sanctions, believing that responsibility is better left to member states. “To be on a blacklist is in itself bad enough and of course there will be consequences for these countries,” Luxembourg Finance Minister Pierre Gramegna said. An existing list of tax havens compiled by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) currently includes only Trinidad and Tobago. The EU originally screened a total of 92 jurisdictions and once the list is compiled it is expected to be continuously updated. In a blow to activists, states that charge no corporate tax are not automatically considered at risk of breaching EU tax criteria. However, the criteria do single out countries that facilitate the creation of shell companies and other structures that could aid tax avoidance. Countries in the EU’s firing line have been given an opportunity to stay off the list if they provide a political commitment and a detailed plan to comply. All countries, which initially included the US, were given until Tuesday’s meeting of the EU’s 28 finance ministers to provide feedback and possible measures to satisfy EU demands. The list is the latest international effort to clamp down on tax avoidance -- increasingly seen as a moral issue -- following the OECD’s move to compile a list of “uncooperative tax havens”. 

https://qz.com/1143056/morgan-stanley-why-amazon-amzn-could-be-worth-1-trillion/

Amazon’s stock reached a new high this week after its Black Friday and Cyber Monday bonanza. The company’s market capitalization is hovering around $560 billion, behind only Apple, Alphabet, and Microsoft. Research analysts at Morgan Stanley think it could go even higher. With Amazon’s core e-commerce business, cloud services platform, signature Prime membership, and other revenue from ads, they make the case that the company could be valued at $1 trillion. Morgan Stanley’s case for a trillion-dollar Amazon starts with the core e-commerce business, which analysts think could be worth $600 billion by the end of 2018, based on their revenue projections. As anyone who has purchased something on Amazon.com knows, there are two types of goods: stuff sold by Amazon, and stuff sold by third-party merchants. Morgan Stanley considers Amazon’s first- and third-party sales to be two distinct businesses, the former valued at about $200 billion and the latter at $400 billion. The difference is that Amazon gets a much better margin on its third-party seller business, presumably because it has to carry fewer operational costs. In the trillion-dollar scenario, Amazon’s cloud services division could be worth $270 billion. That valuation is actually conservative, Morgan Stanley argues, considering that Amazon Web Services (AWS) has better margins and revenue growth than most of its cloud-services competitors. They project AWS will reach $38.5 billion in revenue by 2020; it did $4.6 billion in the latest quarter, up 42% from the same period a year earlier. An estimated 85 million Americans, or two-thirds of US households, subscribe to Prime, Amazon’s $99-a-year membership program. Those Prime customers average $1,300 in annual Amazon spending, more than double a non-Prime member. By 2022, Morgan Stanley sees Prime reaching 146 million subscribers worldwide, for $21 billion in subscription revenue. Working back from that, they believe Prime could be worth $70 billion to investors by as soon as December 2018. Using a similar revenue projection, they think Amazon’s ad business could be worth $55 billion. Prime is essential to Amazon’s success, and the company has been investing in it heavily. Amazon is particularly concerned with building up last-mile delivery—the final leg from a distribution center to a customer’s home—to enable same-day delivery services like Prime Now, Amazon Fresh, and Amazon Restaurants. The company is hoping those investments pay off by making Prime even faster and more convenient, and convincing more people to subscribe. One potential hurdle is getting US households that earn less than $75,000 a year to sign up. Let’s put all that together: a $600 billion retail business, plus a $270 web services segment, a $70 billion Prime business, and $55 billion from ads and other revenue. That’s $995 billion. Or, for our purposes, $1 trillion.

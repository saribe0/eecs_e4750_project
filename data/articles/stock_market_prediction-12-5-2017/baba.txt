Few stocks have been as successful as that of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA). It is up 100% year-to-date which is double that of other high profile winners even Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). This past summer, BABA management promised big things and they delivered. The proof is that even after a huge run, the stock is not bloated. BABA has a price-to-earnings ratio of 49. This is one fifth that of AMZN. Don’t get me wrong, I am not saying it’s cheap but with strong growth and good margins, the price is worth it. So I am very confident that under the current macroeconomic conditions I want to own Alibaba shares, especially if at a discount. First of all, it is evident that the bulls are still in control of the stock market. Bears cannot maintain a selling spree more than a few hours. Secondly, BABA stock has just corrected almost 10%. But it still remains inside a three-month channel. So there is a high chance it bounces instead of breaking down and I want to profit from it. 
Click to Enlarge However, I do have to recognize that if BABA stock falls below $172 per share, it could invite momentum sellers to target the low $160’s. This is not a forecast but I have to know it exists. Luckily, using options I can make room for it. No, I won’t buy the stock at face value. I need more room for error. So I will use options to sell downside risk against support. I believe more strongly in the value below than in the upside targets. With options I can tip the odds of winning in my favor.

Regardless of which metric you utilize, a firm understanding of the concept of volatility and how it is measured is essential to successful investing.

Many value investors look for stocks with a high percent of insider ownership, under the theory that when management are shareholders, they will act in its own self interest, and create shareholder value in the long-term. This aligns the interests of shareholders with management, thus benefiting everyone. While this sounds great in theory, high insider ownership can actually lead to the opposite result, a management team that is unaccountable because they can keep their jobs under almost any circumstance. Currently Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)’s shares owned by insiders are 52.36%, whereas shares owned by institutional owners are 40.60%.

http://www.livetradingnews.com/alibaba-group-holding-ltd-nysebaba-downward-trend-64848.html

Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA) Downward Trend Overall, the bias in prices is: Downwards. Short term: Prices are moving. Intermediate term: Prices are ranging. The projected upper bound is: 178.75. The projected lower bound is: 160.07. The projected closing price is: 169.41.  Candlesticks A big black candle occurred. This is bearish, as prices closed significantly lower than they opened. If the candle appears when prices are “high,” it may be the first sign of a top. If it occurs when prices are confronting an overhead resistance area (e.g., a moving average, trendline, or price resistance level), the long black candle adds credibility to the resistance. Similarly, if the candle appears as prices break below a support area, the long black candle confirms the failure of the support area.
During the past 10 bars, there have been 3 white candles and 7 black candles for a net of 4 black candles. During the past 50 bars, there have been 20 white candles and 30 black candles for a net of 10 black candles. Three black candles occurred in the last three days. Although these candles were not big enough to create three black crows, the steady downward pattern is bearish. Momentum Indicators Momentum is a general term used to describe the speed at which prices move over a given time period. Generally, changes in momentum tend to lead to changes in prices.

Aetna (AET) shares are popping after CVS announced plans to acquire the health insurer for about $69 billion in cash and stock, or about $207 per share. The vertical merger is likely to come under antitrust scrutiny, especially after the administration’s recent moves on the AT&T (T) and Time Warner (TWX) deal. Walt Disney (DIS) shares are higher as the owner of the Magic Kingdom hopes to work some magic in a new round of talks for 21st Century Fox (FOXA) assets, including its film studio, international assets and stake in Hulu. Disney is only one of many recent suitors for Fox, which itself is up 4%, but down slightly for the year. Bank of America (BAC) shares are surging along with other big banks like JPMorgan (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) after the Senate passed its tax bill over the weekend. Shares of Signet Jewelers (SIG) are sinking after the firm disclosed the CFPB is considering legal action related to its “credit practices, promotions, and payment protection products.” Blue Apron (APRN) shares are slightly higher on an upgrade to equal weight from underweight at Barclays. Analysts cited valuation and the promotion of Brad Dickerson to CEO as reasons to be bullish on the meal-kit delivery service.

Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) trades at $29.06 having a market capitalization of $304.3 billion. BAC stock price climbed 36.88% over the past year, yielding a positive weighted alpha of 32.1 percent. Since an alpha above 1 hints at more gains, investors can predict some further rally scope.  Weighted Alpha is used to calculate how much a share has gone up or down over a certain period, normally a year. In general, more thrust is placed on most recent actions by assigning higher weights to it than those assigned to past movements. This assists to give a return figure that has a stronger focus on the most current period and is thus a better measure for short-term analysis. This technique is highly famous among technical analysts. If the stock is up it will have a positively weighted alpha. If the stock price is unchanged its weighted alpha will be smaller. A stock price loss will yield a negatively weighted alpha.  Support is likely to come between $28.82 a share to $28.57 a share level. However, if the BAC shares go below $28.57 then it would indicate a much weaker market for the company. In that case, its shares would mark a 1.69% decline from the most recent price. The typical day in the last two weeks has seen about a 2.85% volatility. The average volume for Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) has been 68.18 million shares per day over the past 30 days. BAC has a 1-week performance of 9.29%. BAC price is down nearly 1.17% from its 52-week high price of $28.72 a share but is up about 27.67% from its 52-week low price of $21.02 a share.  CarMax Inc. (NYSE:KMX) has accumulated 9.29% over the course of one week. It seems that CarMax Inc. (NYSE:KMX) might see muted action given an ABR of 2.1 or Hold rating. Analysts, on average, seem bullish as they suggest KMX is worth $5.56 more, giving a target price of $76.27 a share. BAC share have rallied by 31.49% in percentage terms since the start of the year – and added 4.27% in the last month. Volume in the last session has increased compared with BAC’s average trading volume. We think the increased volume is representative of buyers as it has displayed in many other cases.  KMX’s Stochastic Oscillator (%D) is at 56.51%. Values of %D line that are above 80 indicate that the security is overbought; prices could well fall in the near future. And the values below 20 that it is oversold indicate prices could very well bounce upwards. The Stochastic Oscillator is a powerful technical tool that is somewhat surprisingly easy to understand. In a basic sense, it is used by technicians to measure the speed or momentum of the price movement. It represents the location of the previous close relative to the price range over a set number of periods. This can be more easily understood, however, by pulling apart the two lines on the stochastic oscillator and explaining the simple underlying mathematical formulas. The first line is called the %K line, which analyzes the actual price movements in the shares and can be defined as: %K = (Current Close – Lowest Low)/(Highest High – Lowest Low) * 100. The second line, the %D line is simple a 3-day moving average of the %K line. There are three primary ways to read the Stochastic Oscillator in search of entry points, but traders should follow the %D line closely because that indicates major trends on the chart.  CarMax Inc. (NYSE:KMX)’s latest quote $70.71 $0.96 3.41% will find technical support in $69.56 a share and a breakdown below this region would be a significantly bearish signal for CarMax Inc. traders. Any way you dice it, a dip below $68.4 a share would be very bad news for KMX’s technical picture in the near-term. The $68.4 level represents at least another 3.27% downside for the stock from its current price. If CarMax Inc. (NYSE:KMX) shares can stay above the price resistance around $71.4 a share, that could help propel CarMax Inc. (NYSE:KMX) higher to the next line of resistance at $72.08 a share. The typical day in the last one month has seen about a 1.93% volatility. KMX is down around 23.22% from its 12-month high of $54.29 notched on Apr 06, 2017 but is 59.38% above its highest point the past 12 months of $28.72 a share.

(Note: The author of this fundamental analysis is a financial writer and portfolio manager.) Shares of Bank Of America Corp. (BAC) have been rocketing higher recently, and will probably continue to head higher. In an Investopedia article from October 23, we noted that the stock could be headed to $40 a share based on technical analysis. And it looks like that bull-case scenario may play out. The stock and the sector have climbed in recent weeks as the prospect of tax reform buoys the group. (See also: Bank of America Could Rise Nearly 50%.)  Bank of America shares closed Monday at $29.09. A rise to $40 a share would represent an increase of about 37 percent.  A technical analysis of Bank of America's chart continues to suggest the shares could approach $40. BAC stock broke through a significant hurdle when it rose above resistance at $25.50. The stock has little to no resistance between its current price of around $29.09 and $39.75. The resistance at $39.75 dates back to September 2007.       JPM data by YCharts Since November 27, shares of JP Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and Bank of America have each risen by about 10 percent. But it is likely Bank of America has even more room to increase. Unlike JP Morgan, Bank of America's stock price has failed to come anywhere close to the highs seen before the meltdown of financial stocks during the crisis of 2008.   JPM data by YCharts JP Morgan shares have recovered all of their losses from the financial crisis. Moreover, its stock price is now over 100 percent higher than it was before the meltdown. In contrast, Bank of America's stock is still trading 42.5 percent below its pre-financial crisis highs. Ironically, although Bank of America's stock price has not recovered it past losses, its market cap is 35 percent higher than it was in 2007 because of the share dilution that occurred as a result of the crisis.   JPM Market Cap data by YCharts Bank of America's recent rise could indicate that the stock's spike may be in the very early stages of a further increase on the way to potentially $40.   Michael Kramer is the Founder of Mott Capital Management LLC, a registered investment adviser, and the manager of the company's actively managed, long-only Thematic Growth Portfolio.

Content distribution is hard. You want to keep enough of it close enough to favorite customers so they don’t have to wait and reduce latency for new data. That’s why WICASTR created the SMART Edge Platform, a system for sending content to the very edges of the network, including compatible local routers and access points. “WICASTR is an ‘all in one solution’ for edge computing,” said founder Armine Saidi. “We are like Android ecosystem but for access points, routers and other edge devices: we have hardware, operating system and app store solutions to develop or deploy applications at the extreme edge with a simple 1-click solution.” The company raised $1 million and went through TechStars. Their edge platform was inspired by the events of the Arab Spring. The founders wanted to create a system that would sustain damage caused by governments trying to shut down networks. “The team embarked on a mission to create technology to facilitate seamless and uninterrupted communications and content distribution via all smart devices in the event of deliberate mobile network shutdown by governments,” said Saidi. This means devices on the network can act as content providers, thereby ensuring data can’t go down during an attack. The team has been together for seven years and they have “deep domain expertise in IoT, wireless, software, hardware development, manufacturing and distribution.” They’ve launched with over 20 paying clients and work with Intel, Cisco, and Deutsche Telekom to build out powerful edge delivery.

Over three billion credentials were reported stolen last year. This means that cybercriminals possess usernames and passwords for more than three billion online accounts. And that’s not just social media accounts; it’s bank accounts, retailer gift card accounts with cash and credit cards attached, airline loyalty accounts with years of accumulated frequent flyer points, and other accounts with real value. This statistic is alarming, but in fact it significantly understates the scope of the threat. Because of a form of attack called credential stuffing, tens of billions of other accounts are also at risk. Here’s how that attack works. Because most people have many online accounts (a recent estimate put it at 191 per person on average) they regularly reuse passwords across those accounts. Cybercriminals take advantage of this. In a credential stuffing attack, they take known valid email addresses and passwords from one website breach—for example, the Yahoo breach—and they use those same email addresses and passwords to log in to other websites, such as those of major banks. This represents a completely different type of threat than what the security industry has been prepared for in the past. Investing in all the traditional security in the world to prevent your website from having vulnerabilities will not help if your users’ own bad habits of reusing passwords results in cybercriminals being able to log in to your application just like those users. Our network statistics at Shape Security show that a typical credential stuffing attack has up to a 2% success rate on major websites. In other words, with a set of 1 million stolen passwords from one website, attackers can easily take over 20,000 accounts on another website. Now multiply those numbers by the total number of websites where users have reused their passwords, as well as the number of data breaches that have been reported, to get a better sense of the threat. Of course, that still only includes the data breaches we know about. And new research from Google indicates that phishing may be an even larger source of stolen passwords than data breaches, making the scope of the problem even larger. So what needs to change? Cybersecurity teams are working hard to address this problem, of course. Two-factor authentication (where, in addition to your password, you must also enter a code sent to your mobile device to log in to a website) helps. Unfortunately, it has extremely low adoption rates since users find it inconvenient and websites that serve consumers are unwilling to make it a mandatory component of logging in. User education is a long-term industry effort, but educating a society and then creating consistent behavior change is a multi-decade solution to a problem that needs to be fixed now. A similar problem exists with phishing. Corporations are spending massive resources educating their workforces on the dangers of clicking on untrusted links in emails and text messages, but it’s all but impossible to make 100% of your employees 100% perfect at detecting phishing attempts 100% of the time. This means that it’s just a matter of time and effort for a dedicated attacker to gain access to almost any corporate network. Companies engage in a repeating cycle of building new services, experiencing public security incidents on them, and then implementing new security controls and protocols, which appear effective—until they are not. One fundamental problem with this repeating cycle is that there is too much “attack surface” for most organizations to defend without unrealistic levels of investment. This means there are too many ways that an attacker can take advantage of any part of the technology infrastructure in most companies to breach them or create harm. Large enterprises typically operate dozens of security products with growing headcount in all areas of their security organizations. These teams are constantly learning new products, trying to keep up-to-date with new types of attacks, and patching their infrastructure for newly disclosed vulnerabilities. These systems and processes generate more data and work than most teams can process efficiently, which creates predictable rates of success for ROI-driven attackers engaged in schemes like credential stuffing. The current state of affairs in corporate cybersecurity is similar to how most organizations used to approach much of their IT operations, prior to the advent of public cloud infrastructure. Jeff Bezos has said that the purpose of Amazon Web Services (AWS) was to remove the burden of “undifferentiated heavy lifting” that companies needed to constantly perform to operate their IT infrastructure. The market has validated this value proposition: AWS reported this year that their revenue grew 42% to $4.1B for the second quarter while Microsoft’s cloud business, Microsoft Azure, grew an astonishing 93%. This same principle is even more important for cybersecurity. Because cybersecurity is so complicated and attacks change so rapidly, it’s untenable to expect every organization in every industry to invest the time and resources to stay ahead of sophisticated cybercriminals. There is also a revolving door of security products they must select, deploy, and ultimately decommission on a regular basis. One chief information security officer of a Fortune 500 company told me that he now asks new security vendors not only how long it takes to deploy their product, but how long it takes to “un-deploy” it, since he expects to only use any new security product for about two years. Clearly, this methodology is not working, as exemplified by the accelerating series of data breaches, fraud attacks, and other security incidents that have been announced over the last decade. The answer is for companies to approach the problem differently — to improve the efficacy of the entire system. There are examples of such systemic improvements that we can find in other fields. One of the most successful public health interventions of all time was the addition of iodine to salt since 1924. Humans need iodine in their diets, but it’s next to impossible to get enough people to consistently alter their diets to ensure they get enough iodine. Instead of trying to change all of society’s behavior, the system itself was altered to correct the problem more or less invisibly. That doesn’t mean we don’t have public health campaigns and an individual responsibility to eat well and exercise, but it does mean most people don’t have to worry about iodine deficiency anymore. Similarly, the long-term answer to cybersecurity lies in dividing which cybersecurity challenges should be the responsibility of individual companies from which should come from platforms and services that take responsibility for foundational security. This model allows technology and service providers to make not only necessary, but extraordinary R&D investments to create the best possible security capabilities and practices for all companies. A platform provider spending $1B and hiring from the top of the security talent pool to provide shared capabilities to 100 companies produces far more benefit than those 100 companies spending $100M each on the same “undifferentiated heavy lifting”. This doesn’t mean that cybersecurity and fraud teams within corporations will shrink or go away—far from it. In fact, cybersecurity has become, and going forward will always be, an issue where even CEOs and boards will be held accountable, so major internal investments are guaranteed. But instead of those teams engaging in the same commoditized activities as the cybersecurity teams in every other organization, they will be able to specialize in those aspects that are unique to their business and leverage their improved expertise to create greater impact in their work. So will the combination of more effective cybersecurity teams using platforms with foundational cybersecurity built-in provide 100% security? Certainly not. The only way to absolutely guarantee the security of any system is to shut down that system. Instead, practical security is about tradeoffs and ROI. By making a carefully considered distinction between individual corporate responsibilities and platform responsibilities, each can invest more effectively, and we can provide the most security, for the greatest number of users, the vast majority of the time.

A view of the headquarters of German bank Deutsche Bank in London on May 5, 2017. / Special counsel Robert Mueller has sent a subpoena to Deutsche Bank to share any information on accounts held by President Trump and his family as his investigation into any possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russian government continues, according to Reuters news service. Reuters, citing a person close to the matter, says that the bank received a subpoena from Mueller several weeks ago to provide data on certain money and credit transactions. Germany's largest bank says it does not comment on any of its clients, but is known to have lent millions of dollars to the Trump organization as part of its real estate dealings.  In a statement to CBS News, a Deutsche Bank spokesman said, "Deutsche Bank takes its legal obligations seriously and remains committed to cooperating with authorized investigations into this matter."   Mr. Trump was previously caught in litigation with the bank over outstanding balances on construction loans.  According to The New York Times, banking regulators were reviewing those hundreds of millions of dollars in loans made to the president's businesses through Deutsche Bank's private wealth management unit back in July.  Regulators want to know if Mr. Trump exposed the bank to unnecessary risk after casino and hotel bankruptcies left the German bank among a short list of financial institutions willing to do business with him, the Times reported.  In May, Democrats on the House Financial Services Committee specifically asked for results of a review the bank reportedly took of accounts held by Mr. Trump and members of his family to see if there were any connections to the Russian government  The bank rejected those demands in June, citing privacy laws.

For more than a year, Uber Technologies Inc. concealed a massive hack that exposed the personal data of millions of drivers and riders, violating a California law that requires companies to promptly report such breaches, according to a lawsuit filed Monday by Los Angeles City Attorney Mike Feuer. In October 2016, hackers stole the names, cellphone numbers and email addresses of more than 57 million riders across the world, as well as driver's license numbers for 600,000 Uber drivers in the United States. Uber disclosed the hack last month. Feuer filed the lawsuit in Los Angeles County Superior Court on behalf of California residents. The case will focus on Uber's failure to disclose the data breach to Uber's California drivers, he said. California law requires companies to report hacks "in the most expedient time possible" and "without unreasonable delay" when some forms of personal data, including driver's license numbers, are compromised. The law is designed to help consumers fight identity theft. Instead, Uber paid the hackers $100,000 to destroy the data, pressured them to sign nondisclosure agreements, and portrayed the ransom as a payment to test the vulnerabilities of the company's data security systems, according to the lawsuit. "We're taking action because we believe very strongly in the importance of protecting consumers," Feuer said Monday at a news conference at Los Angeles City Hall. The consumer protection law is commonly invoked in the lawsuits that follow data breaches. In September, San Francisco's city attorney cited the law in a suit filed against Equifax, alleging the company failed to promptly disclose a hack that affected more than 15 million California residents. Feuer said he doesn't yet know how many drivers in California were affected in Uber's lawsuit. The lawsuit seeks $2,500 for each violation of the law. Any payments would be shared between the city and the county of Los Angeles, and would be spent on consumer protection efforts, Feuer said. In a statement, an Uber spokesperson said the company is happy to address regulators' questions, and is "committed to changing the way we do business, putting integrity at the core of every decision we make, and working hard to regain the trust of consumers." Uber Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi, who was hired in August to replace controversial founder Travis Kalanick, said in a blog post last month that he learned of the hack months after it occurred. Uber's chief of security and another employee were fired for not revealing the hack, and the company has provided free credit monitoring and identity theft protection to affected drivers, Khosrowshahi said. "None of this should have happened, and I will not make excuses for it," Khosrowshahi said. "While I can't erase the past, I can commit on behalf of every Uber employee that we will learn from our mistakes." The hack did not expose Uber riders' trip histories, credit card numbers, bank account numbers, Social Security numbers or dates of birth, he said. In January 2016, Uber paid a $20,000 fine to the New York attorney general for failing to promptly report a separate data breach in 2014. That previous disclosure, Monday's lawsuit said, makes the company's "gross conduct ... even more alarming." laura.nelson@latimes.com Twitter: @laura_nelson

It has been more than a month since the last earnings report for Gilead Sciences, Inc. GILD. Shares have lost about 7.9% in that time frame, underperforming the market. Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts. Gilead’s HCV Sales Weak, Earnings Beat Gilead reported third quarter 2017 results wherein both earnings and revenues surpassed expectations. The company’s third-quarter earnings (including the impact of stock-based compensation expenses) of $2.27 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.09. However, earnings were below the year-ago quarter figure of $2.75. Moreover, total revenues of $6.5 billion topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.3 billion. However, revenues declined 13.2% year over year. HIV Impresses Yet Again, Harvoni & Sovaldi Plunges Product sales came in at $6.4 billion, down 13.5% year over year. The decline was due to lower hepatitis C virus (HCV) sales, partially offset by higher sales across HIV and other therapeutic areas. Antiviral product sales, which include Gilead's HIV and liver disease portfolio, came in at $5.8 billion in the reported quarter, down 14.7%. HCV product sales, which include Harvoni, Sovaldi, Epclusa and Vosevi, were $2.2 billion, down from $3.3 billion reported in the year-ago quarter. The downside was mainly attributed to lower sales of Harvoni and Sovaldi across all major markets, partially offset by sales of Epclusa (launched in 2016) and sales of Vosevi (approved in the United States and Europe in July 2017). Sales of Harvoni declined 47.7% year over year to $973 million in the reported quarter. Further, Sovaldi sales recorded a steep year-over-year decline of 73.4% to $219 million. Epclusa garnered sales of $882 million in the reported quarter, up from the year-ago figure of $640 million. We note that Epclusa was launched in the U.S. and Europe in June and Jul 2016, respectively. Meanwhile, HIV and HBV product sales came in at $3.6 billion, up 16.1% year over year. The increase was primarily driven by continuous strong uptake of tenofoviral afenamide (TAF)-based products such as Genvoya, which generated sales of $988 million, up from $461 million in the year-ago quarter, Descovy, which recorded sales of $316 million, up from $88 million, and Odefsey, which registered sales of $296 million, up from $105 million. HIV treatments like Stribild and Complera/Eviplera sales declined 63.1% and 42.3% respectively. Viread sales were down at $274 million, down 9.6%. Atripla sales tanked 32.4% to $439 million, while Truvada sales fell 5.5% to $811 million. Other products like Letairis, Ranexa, AmBisome and Zydelig recorded sales of $213 million (down 0.9%), $164 million (down 3.5%), $92 million (up 1.1%) and $40 million (up 2.5%), respectively. Research & development (R&D) expenses declined 24% to $745 million. On the other hand, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 3.3% to $806 million. Adjusted product gross margin was 87.2% compared to 87.6% in the year-ago period. 2017 Guidance Updated Gilead now expects net product sales in the range of $24.5-$25.5 billion, up from $24.0-$25.5 billion provided earlier. Non-HCV product sales are projected between $16 billion and $16.5 billion (earlier projection: $15.5 billion and $16 billion). HCV product sales are projected between $8.5 billion and $9.0 billion (earlier projection: $8.5 billion and $9.5 billion). Adjusted R&D expenses and adjusted SG&A expenses are now projected in the range of $3.3-$3.4 billion and $3.3-$3.4 billion, respectively. Adjusted product gross margin is expected in the range of 86-87%. Earnings per share are now projected around $1.02-$1.17 (earlier projection: 86-93 cents). Kite Acquisition The company recently acquired Kite Pharma. Last week, the company received FDA approval for Yescarta, a CAR-T therapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy. Dividend and Share Repurchase Concurrently, Gilead declared a cash dividend of 52 cents per share of common stock for fourth-quarter 2017. The dividend is payable on Dec 28 to stockholders of record at the close of business on Dec 15. During the quarter, the company paid cash dividends of $682 million and repurchased shares for $153 million. How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then? Following the release and in the last month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There has been one revision lower for the current quarter. Gilead Sciences, Inc.

 China is hot and soaring among all the other equity markets this year thanks to improving economic growth. In fact, China is leading the global markets, attaining the best-performing country spot in the year-to-date time frame (read: 4 International ETFs Worth Buying at New Highs  ).  makeArticleAd();  But the incredible run eased somewhat last week as a combination of factors including tightening liquidity and jitters over bond markets led to steep sell-off in the large-cap shares. The blue-chip CSI300 Index tumbled nearly 3% on Nov 23, marking the worst one-day loss in nearly 18 months. The sell-off was again witnessed on Nov 27, with CSI 300 Index dropping 1.3%.   Inside The Pain    Worries over tightening liquidity have built up lately as China took steps to restrict the rapidly growing and lightly regulated market for online micro-lenders to fend off financial risk. The central bank has suspended regulatory approval for setting up of new Internet micro-lenders, sending shares of U.S.-listed Chinese financial firms into a tailspin.    Meanwhile, rising Chinese bond yields spooked investors, dulling the attractiveness of the stock markets as an alternative higher-yielding investment. This is because rising yields will increase financing costs and thus have a negative impact on corporate profits.    If these weren't enough, the Chinese government's warning about lofty valuation for one of the nation's hottest stocks, Kweichow Moutai Co, added to the woes. The government cautioned that shares of China's biggest liquor maker is rising too fast, creating panic among investors.      Rounds of downbeat data also took a toll on the stock market. Profits at China's industrial firms slightly cooled down in October, rising 25.1% after jumping 27.7% in September. Meanwhile, debt climbed 23% in September - the fastest pace in four years (read: China Economic Data Disappoints: ETFs in Focus  ).     ETF Impact    Quite expectedly, the terrible trading has been felt in the Chinese ETF world too. Funds in this space also saw big losses over the past one week. VanEck Vectors China SME-ChiNext ETF CNXT   was the biggest loser shedding 4.8% in the same time frame, followed by declines of 3.3% in Deutsche X-trackers Harvest CSI 500 China-A Shares Small Cap Fund ASHS   , and 2.6% each in Guggenheim China Technology ETF CQQQ  and Global X NASDAQ China Technology ETF QQQC   (see: all the emerging Asia Pacific ETFs here  ).   CNXT    This fund offers exposure to the largest and most-liquid China A-share stocks listed and trading on the Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) Board and the ChiNext Board of the Shenzhen Stock Exchange by tracking the SME-ChiNext 100 index. It holds 102 stocks in its basket with none accounting for more than 5.74% share. About one-third of the portfolio is allotted to information technology, while industrials, consumer discretionary and materials round off the next three spots with double-digit exposure each. The product is unpopular with AUM of $22.9 million and charges 81 bps in fees per year. CNXT has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a High risk outlook.   ASHS    This fund offers direct exposure to small-cap China A-share equities and follows the China Securities 500 Index. Holding 512 stocks in its basket, it is widely spread across components with none holding more than 1.03% of assets. Industrials, material, information technology, consumer discretionary and healthcare are the top five sectors with double-digit exposure each.  It is often overlooked by investors as depicted by AUM of $24.3 million.

CQQQ    This fund targets the overall technology sector in China and follows the AlphaShares China Technology Index, holding 72 stocks in its basket.

Recent insider trends for Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) have caught the attention of investors. Analysts monitor insider data to understand the sentiment of a company’s largest and most important shareholders. GILD’s insider trading patterns have some implications for where the stock might be headed. Institutions own 77.52% of Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD)’s shares. The total value of these holdings, in millions, is $74,599. Among active positions in the latest quarter, 722 holders increased their positions by a total of 96.83 million shares, 752 holders decreased the positions by a total of 68.55 million shares, and 169 holders held their positions. This works out to a net increase in ownership of 28.28 million shares, and suggests that institutions are feeling bullish about the stock. Among new and sold out positions, 118 holders initiated new positions by a total of 12.55 million shares and 123 holders exited their positions by a total of 10.42 million shares. This nets out to an increase of 2.13 million shares and is a bullish sign for GILD. In the last three months, insiders executed a total of 17 trades. 4 of these were buys and 13 were sells. Insider ownership decreased by a total of 564316 shares, which suggests that GILD’s key executives are feeling less optimistic about the outlook for the stock.

     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Comparing the number of shares sold short over time is a method analysts often use to get a reading on investor sentiment. Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD)’s short interest is 0 shares.

A composite of 13 technical indicators that includes measures such as moving averages and momentum oscillators suggests that GILD is a Weak buy, which implies that GILD is expected to outperform the market based on prior trading patterns.

Gilead Sciences, Inc.  (NASDAQ: GILD) stands to benefit on multiple fronts, which prompted an analyst to upgrade the shares of the company Thursday. Maxim Group analyst Jason McCarthy upgraded his rating on the shares of Gilead Sciences from Hold to Buy and  set a $94 price target.  The  Kite Pharma Inc  (NASDAQ: KITE)  buy comes with the stock "for free"; the comparisons are easing for Gilead Sciences' HCV franchise; and Gilead had $2.7 billion in free cash flow in the recently reported quarter, McCarthy said in a note. (See McCarthy's track record here.)  Following a meeting with senior executives in Beijing, where manufacturing plans for the launch of Yescarta were presented, Maxim said it is now confident the company can overcome manufacturing challenges to commercialize in the U.S. and globally.  Yescarta — a cell-based gene therapy to treat adult patients with certain types of large B-cell lymphoma who have not responded to or who have relapsed after at least two other kinds of treatment — was approved by the FDA in October. Maxim views this as the start, with approvals likely coming in Europe, China and Japan. "With a global presence in late stage B cell cancer, Gilead is positioned to generate over $5 billion in outyears," McCarthy said.  Maxim's model now incorporates Yescarta revenues from China and Japan, in addition to revenues from both the U.S. and EU. The Kite acquisition makes Gilead Sciences an industry leader in cell therapy, McCarthy said. "This is the start of a new oncology paradigm."  Gilead Sciences' shares are up 2.88 percentyear-to-date, underperforming the 17.3-percent gain for the  iShares NASDAQ Biotechnology Index (ETF)  (NASDAQ: IBB). At the time of writing, shares of Gilead Sciences were rising 1.33 percent to $74.65.

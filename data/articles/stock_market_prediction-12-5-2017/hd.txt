Consistently, one of the more popular stocks people enter into their stock options watchlist  at Stock Options Channel is Home Depot Inc (Symbol: HD). So this week we highlight one interesting put contract, and one interesting call contract, from the January 2018 expiration for HD. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting, is at the $180 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $2.48. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 1.4% return against the $180 commitment, or a 10.9% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost  ).      Selling a put does not give an investor access to HD's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. So unless Home Depot Inc sees its shares decline 3.2% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $177.52 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $2.48 from $180), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 10.9% annualized rate of return.  makeArticleAd();  Worth considering, is that the annualized 10.9% figure actually exceeds the 1.9% annualized dividend paid by Home Depot Inc by 9%, based on the current share price of $185.99. And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to lose 3.18% to reach the $180 strike price.    Always important when discussing dividends is the fact that, in general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Home Depot Inc, looking at the dividend history chart for HD below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 1.9% annualized dividend yield.    Turning to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the January 2018 expiration, for shareholders of Home Depot Inc (Symbol: HD) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 1.9% annualized dividend yield. Selling the covered call at the $190 strike and collecting the premium based on the $3.10 bid, annualizes to an additional 13.2% rate of return against the current stock price (this is what we at Stock Options Channel refer to as the YieldBoost  ), for a total of 15.2% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $190 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but HD shares would have to advance 2.2% from current levels for that to occur, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 3.9% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.    The chart below shows the trailing twelve month trading history for Home Depot Inc, highlighting in green where the $180 strike is located relative to that history, and highlighting the $190 strike in red:       The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2018 put or call options highlighted in this article deliver a rate of return that represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Home Depot Inc (considering the last 252 trading day HD historical stock prices  using closing values, as well as today's price of $185.99) to be 14%.    In mid-afternoon trading on Monday, the put volume among S&P 500 components was 1.18M contracts, with call volume at 2.40M, for a put:call ratio of 0.49 so far for the day. Compared to the long-term median put:call ratio of .65, that represents very high call volume relative to puts; in other words, buyers are preferring calls in  options trading  so far today.

Consistently, one of the more popular stocks people enter into their stock options watchlist  at Stock Options Channel is Costco Wholesale Corp (Symbol: COST). So this week we highlight one interesting put contract, and one interesting call contract, from the December expiration for COST. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting, is at the $182.50 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $1.86. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 1% return against the $182.50 commitment, or a 33.8% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost  ).      Selling a put does not give an investor access to COST's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. So unless Costco Wholesale Corp sees its shares decline 2.4% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $180.64 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $1.86 from $182.50), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 33.8% annualized rate of return.  makeArticleAd();  Interestingly, that annualized 33.8% figure actually exceeds the 1.1% annualized dividend paid by Costco Wholesale Corp by 32.7%, based on the current share price of $186.96. And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to lose 2.39% to reach the $182.50 strike price.

Selling the covered call at the $190 strike and collecting the premium based on the $2.33 bid, annualizes to an additional 41.4% rate of return against the current stock price (this is what we at Stock Options Channel refer to as the YieldBoost  ), for a total of 42.4% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $190 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but COST shares would have to advance 1.6% from current levels for that to occur, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 2.9% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.

https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/05/nvidias-shield-tv-offers-wii-and-gamecube-games-in-hd-in-china/

Nvidia just rolled out a very interesting selection of software for its over-the-top Shield TV box in China – Wii games, running in 1080p resolution, including New Super Mario Bros. Wii, The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Prince’s, and PUNCH-OUT!!. It’s only in China, where Shield TV is launching for the first time, but it’s an official tie-up between Nvidia and Nintendo, which could offer some hope, however narrow, that this could make its way to other Shield hardware around the world. Remastered Wii games on the Shield TV retail for around $10 per title, and other games including Metroid Prime and Super Mario Galaxy will eventually make their way to the platform, too. Nvidia and Nintendo have partnered before now, of course – the graphics hardware maker created the processor that powers the Nintendo Switch portable hybrid game console. China has also been a tricky market for Nintendo to operate within thanks to a ban on video game consoles first instituted in 2000 and lifted only in 2015. Lest you hope that Shield TV playing Wii games could be a sign that ports arrive on Android more broadly, take note that the Shield TV Nvidia is selling in China is “completely localized,” with its own store and local content and Baidu’s DuerOS and iQIYI media service, so there’s a lot of this that is going to be totally unique to China.

A new desktop app for League of Legends lets players quickly download the best HD wallpapers and screensavers the game has to offer. Revealed on Monday, Riot Gamesâ new app thatâs called League Displays will work on both Windows and Mac devices. Accessing the huge catalog of wallpapers and screensavers is as easy as downloading whatever version of League Displays you need based on your operating system. From there, youâll be able to choose from different display sets ranging from specific skin lines like the PROJECT or Snowdown skins to animated artwork. The League Displays app is brand new, but some might remember that there was another app that functioned in a similar way. A Rioter confirmed on Reddit that this new app would indeed be replacing the previous one that was available, the differences being that this one will have extra features while offering everything that the previous app did. As the League Display site stated, the Rioter also confirmed that the app will be updated with every new release, so youâll be able to grab the screensavers and splash arts for each new champion and skin as theyâre added to the game. League Displays also supports various display options no matter if youâre using an ultra-wide or vertical monitor or if you have multiple displays. Unfortunately, it appears that the app doesnât support mobile devices or tablets just yet. Trying to access the app through one of those platforms will present you with a message saying to download it on a desktop. If youâre having trouble finding out how youâre supposed to actually set the images as your wallpapers and screensavers once inside the app, the same Rioter had a quick explanation ready to help. âOnce you've selected wallpapers or screensavers you can click "Finalize" on the top right. That'll take you to a page that looks like a checkout screen. Once there you can review the images and confirm they are indeed the ones you'd like to use. If they are the desired images just hit "Activate" in the top right again and it should apply your desired wallpapers/screensavers!â The app will continue to be updated with new content coming as early as this week, so check back for more content soon if you donât see what youâre looking for.

 Imogen Hargreaves (PC World) on 05 December, 2017 12:12 Epson Australia has built on the success of its popular all-in-one printers, the Expression Premium Photo range, with the launch of the new XP-6000, XP-8500, and XP-15000 models.  Stylish and compact, these versatile all-in-one models combine printing, scanning and copy facilities in one unit – ideal for modern homes. With a host of mobile printing options, it’s easy to produce glossy photos and crisp, clear documents from almost anywhere.  The XP-6000 offers a new compact design, faster speeds of 15.8ppm (black) and 11.3 ppm (colour), CD/DVD printing, auto 2-sided printing, wireless Wi-Fi Direct, AirPrint, Google Cloud Print, a 2.4” LCD screen, a 100 sheet input first tray and a 20 sheet input second tray and a 50-sheet output capacity.   The XP-8500 offers all the same features as the XP-6000 while also offering a 6-colour printing solution – a major bonus from home premium photo printing.  Busy households and aspiring photographers can take the fuss and expense out of printing photos with a printer that can produce better-than-lab-quality photographs at home. The Expression Premium Photo range uses Claria Premium Inks, which are renowned for producing outstanding, glossy photos with sharp detail, deep blacks and rich, vibrant colours. The XP-6000’s five inks and XP-8500’s 6 inks can be individually replaced as and when a particular colour runs out. They’re also designed to handle printing documents expertly too, providing the complete package.  The Expression premium Photo models’ connectivity features provide more freedom for users. There is no need to be deskbound; Wi-Fi ensures it’s easy to print and scan from around the home and Wi-Fi Direct makes it possible to print without a wireless network.  It’s easy to print and scan wirelessly from a smartphone or tablet around the home using the iPrint app, and for those that are out and about, Epson Email Print lets users email documents and photos directly to the printer from almost anywhere in the world.

In conjunction with the release of his 39th album The Visitor, singer-songwriter Neil Young has just opened the doors to his vault with the Neil Young Archives, a site that contains nearly his entire back catalog available in a high-quality streaming format. Young has often voiced his concerns about the poor quality of the audio we’ve all been listening to for the past several years. At the D: Dive into Media conference in 2012, he said that the average MP3 file only contains about 5 percent of the audio from an original recording, according to The Verge. Unlike many artists, Young seemed was dismissive about piracy concerns and streaming music. “It doesn’t affect me because I look at the internet as the new radio. I look at the radio as gone,” he said. “If you really want to hear it, let’s make it available, let them hear it, let them hear the 95 percent of it.” He even Kickstarted his own music service, only to become frustrated with the whole process and eventually announcing that he was pulling his catalog from all streaming services due to the low quality. “When the quality is back, I’ll give it another look. Never say never,” he wrote. That time is apparently now. The Neil Young Archive gives fans the opportunity to listen to nearly everything he’s ever done free, at least through the end of June. After that, you can subscribe for a “modest cost.” Young’s own high-quality music service is called Xstream, and it’s an adaptable service that changes with available bandwidth. The Master setting delivers 24-bit high-resolution audio, or you can toggle back to 320kbps if necessary. The site contains everything Young has released as a soloist or bandleader, plus his work as a member of Buffalo Springfield and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. However, as Pitchfork notes, unreleased albums and recordings Chrome Dreams, Homegrown, and Toast are not yet available to stream. The site navigation itself is rather clunky and old-fashioned, and that’s probably by design. In his introductory video, Young encourages exploration and discovery. A good place to start is probably the Timeline section, where you can scroll through various milestones during Young’s five decades of performing, and click through to the various albums from different points in his career. Films and books are also included, so you can spend many hours just browsing through the career of this incredible musician. As he admonishes in the welcome video, “Don’t forget to have a good time. And try not to get lost.”

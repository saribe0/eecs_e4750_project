Consistently, one of the more popular stocks people enter into their stock options watchlist at Stock Options Channel is JPMorgan Chase & Co (Symbol: JPM). So this week we highlight one interesting put contract, and one interesting call contract, from the June 2018 expiration for JPM. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting, is at the $95 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $2.36. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 2.5% return against the $95 commitment, or a 4.7% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost ).      Turning to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the June 2018 expiration, for shareholders of JPMorgan Chase & Co (Symbol: JPM) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 2.1% annualized dividend yield. Selling the covered call at the $115 strike and collecting the premium based on the $3.10 bid, annualizes to an additional 5.5% rate of return against the current stock price (this is what we at Stock Options Channel refer to as the YieldBoost ), for a total of 7.6% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $115 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but JPM shares would have to climb 7.3% from current levels for that to occur, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 10.2% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.

Wall Street indexes surged on Monday after the U.S. Senate passed its version of a tax code overhaul, bringing the Republicans closer to implementing corporate tax cuts. Some of the biggest gainers included bank and industrial stocks. Bank of America and JPMorgan rose more than 3 percent, while Caterpillar and Boeing gained about 2 percent. “This is a positive reaction to the Senate’s passage,” said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas. The Senate on Saturday approved their version of tax bill in a narrow 51-49 vote. The Senate and the House of Representatives will have to settle differences in their respective versions before it becomes a law. “That (reconciliation) can be a bit of a challenge because there are differences and the number of approvals to pass it is a little bit higher than it was for the individual two sides of the Congress,” said Frederick. The S&P 500 has risen about 18 percent this year on strong corporate earnings and solid economic growth and also on hopes that Trump’s agenda of corporate tax cuts and looser regulations could come through. (Source: Reuters) At 9:35 a.m. ET (1435 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 203.98 points, or 0.84 percent, at 24,435.57, the S&P 500 was up 18.35 points, or 0.70 percent, at 2,660.57 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 41.45 points, or 0.61 percent, at 6,889.04. Top Pick for Tuesday: JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) has grabbed attention from the analysts when it experienced a change of 2.06% in the last trading session to close at $106.95. A total of 23,550,262 shares exchanged hands during the intra-day trade contrast with its average trading volume of 12.32M shares, while its relative volume stands at 1.91. Relative volume is the comparison of current volume to average volume for the same time of day, and it’s displayed as a ratio. If RVOL is less than 1 it is not In Play on this trading day and Investors may decide not to trade it.  If RVOL is above 2 it is In Play and this is more evidence Investors ought to be in the name.  When stocks are *very* In Play one can see a RVOL of 5 and above.  The higher the RVOL the more In Play the stock is. Day traders strive to make money by exploiting minute price movements in individual assets (usually stocks, though currencies, futures, and options are traded as well), usually leveraging large amounts of capital to do so, therefore they trade on Stocks in Play. In Play Stocks are volatile enough to produce good risk and reward trading opportunities for both bull and bear traders intraday. Most company stocks have very little volatility. They generally move extremely slowly and they only produce big price swings when the company produces good or bad trading results, which may only happen a couple of times a year at best. In deciding what to focus on – in a stock, say – a typical day trader looks for three things: liquidity, volatility and trading volume. Liquidity allows an investor to enter and exit a stock at a good price (i.e. tight spreads, or the difference between the bid and ask price of a stock, and low slippage, or the difference between the predictable price of a trade and the actual price). If a stock does not have good liquidity then it may take some time before a broker is able to negotiate a deal to buy or sell a stock and the broker may not be able to get the sell or buy price that the trader is looking for. This is a problem for day traders and it could mean the difference between a profitable and non-profitable trade. Traders have different rules for what constitutes liquidity and a good guide is the volume of trades and volume of shares that are traded each day. 100,000 shares traded per day would be a minimum for most traders and some require 1,000,000. Trading volume is a gauge of how many times a stock is bought and sold in a given time period (most commonly, within a day of trading, known as the average daily trading volume – ADTV). A high degree of volume indicates a lot of interest in a stock. Often, a boost in the volume of a stock is a harbinger of a price jump, either up or down. Volatility is simply a measure of the predictable daily price range—the range in which a day trader operates. More volatility means greater profit or loss. After a recent check, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) stock is found to be 2.62% volatile for the week, while 1.57% volatility is recorded for the month. WePay declared it is officially a Chase company, after JPMorgan Chase accomplished the transaction declared in October. WePay will continue to provide integrated payments to global software platforms like Freshbooks and Constant Contact, now with the backing of the nation’s leading financial institution. As part of the Chase family, it will provide instant merchant onboarding and give software developers and partners access to Chase’s network of four million small business clients. More than 1,000 software companies have adopted payments as a service from WePay, and expanding that business will be a priority for both organizations. WePay CEO Bill Clerico and his executive team will continue to lead the company, working alongside Chase Merchant Services CEO Matt Kane and his leadership team. The fintech company will continue as a standalone entity, while also leveraging Chase’s broader capabilities and acting as a payments incubator for the firm. Technical’s Snapshot: The stock has a market cap of $378.04B and the number of outstanding shares has been calculated 3.53B. Based on a recent bid, its distance from 20 days simple moving average is 7.44%, and its distance from 50 days simple moving average is 8.54% while it has a distance of 16.81% from the 200 days simple moving average. The company’s distance from 52-week high price is 0.27% and the current price is 32.20% away from 52-week low price. The company has Relative Strength Index (RSI 14) of 78.45 together with Average True Range (ATR 14) of 1.85. Stock’s Valuation: Past 5 years growth of JPM observed at 6.80%, and for the next five years the analysts that follow this company is expecting its growth at 8.81%.

The 20 stocks listed in the table below have attracted the highest total weekly options volume during the past 10 trading days. Data is courtesy of Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White. Two names to note are bank stock JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) and streaming content provider Roku Inc (NASDAQ:ROKU). Below, we'll break down recent options trading activity on JPM and ROKU.   Earlier today, JPMorgan stock touched a record high of $108.40, and was last seen trading up 2.4% at $107.23. The entire financial sector is enjoying a breakout day, cheering the business-friendly Republican tax plan that the Senate passed over the weekend. In addition, the central bank's expected decision to raise interest rates later this month has been a boon for bank stocks. JPM stock has added over 24% in 2017. During the past two weeks at the International Securities Exchange (ISE), Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), and NASDAQ OMX PHLX (PHLX), options traders have bought to open 1.55 JPM call options for every put. Digging deeper, the December 120 call is home to the largest increase in open interest during this time frame, with nearly 16,500 contracts added. For "vanilla" traders who bought to open calls here, the goal is for JPM stock to rise above $120 before front-month options expire at the close on Friday, Dec. 15.  Among weekly options, the 12/29 120-strike call saw the biggest increase to open interest, with nearly 4,400 contracts added in the past two weeks. Again, vanilla buyers of the calls expect JPM to surmount $120, but before the Dec. 29 expiration date. Today, options traders are once again favoring JPM calls, which are trading at two times the expected intraday rate, with more than 70,000 traded so far. In fact, JPMorgan call volume is on pace for the 98th percentile of its annual range. Furthermore, the equity's Schaeffer's Volatility Scorecard (SVS) of 95 suggests the bank stock had consistently rewarded premium buyers over the past year, relative to what the options market had priced in.
 ROKU stock touched a record high of $51.80 early last week, thanks to encouraging Cyber Monday sales. However, the stock is now on pace for a fifth straight day in the red, down 2.3% to trade at $42.55 -- and testing support at its 10-day moving average -- as tech stocks struggle. Still, Roku shares are  trading at more than three times their September initial public offering (IPO) price of $14. 
The tech stock could resume its uptrend soon, in the form of a short squeeze. Short interest  increased by 51% during the last reporting period, to 7.23 million shares, a new all-time high. This represents a whopping 46% of ROKU's total available float.
 Call buyers have been active on Roku,and perhaps some of that -- at least at out-of-the-money (OOTM) strikes -- is attributable to short sellers seeking an options hedge. The security has a 10-day call/put volume ratio of 1.41 at the ISE, CBOE, and PHLX, and the largest increase in open interest during this time was at the OOTM weekly 12/1 50-strike call, where nearly 5,600 positions were added. However, excluding now-expired weekly calls, the January 18 put saw the biggest open interest change.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) looks like a runaway train, but it’s far from derailing. It’s still a value from which I can profit. Investors on Wall Street rejoiced yesterday and pushed banks stocks up a bunch. For example, JPM stock gained 3.5% on the day, which is very unusual without any specific headline. But it wasn’t the only one — the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLF) was up 2.6% and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) was also up 4%. So is it too late to chase and go long JPMorgan Chase stock? No. I will go long the stock but without much of the usual hopium that requires higher prices to profit. My trade will be profitable even if JPM stock falls another 20%. JPM is the creme of the crop of financial institutions. They rarely give traders specific cause to sell the stock. They also have a fortress balance sheet. Furthermore, after the most recent stress tests, management vowed to financial engineer the stock with buybacks and dividends. So it’s no wonder that the stock is up 28% in one year. Even at these levels JPM is not expensive. It still only trades at a price-to-earnings ratio under 15x. This is cheap by any standard. Furthermore, it only trades at 1.5 times book value. So I am very confident that it won’t be a mistake if I have to own shares at a discount from here. Although the Donald Trump administration has had its challenges, they stay committed to removing red tape for banks. So these favorable operating conditions are likely to persist. In addition, we are still in a cycle of rate tightening which in theory should also benefit JPM bottom line. Technically, this spike on Tuesday helped avert a retest of an important ascending trend line, which could have threatened JPMorgan’s trajectory. Now it’s in the clear from it for a while. Moreover, it speaks to the difficult of shorting these bank stocks. The fewer traders that are willing to short the easier the path upwards.

Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) has a price-to-sales ratio of 1.81, well below its Aerospace/Defense Products & Services competitors. For the industry, the average P/S ratio sits at 6.44, which is less than the sector’s 9.79. In the past 13-year record, this ratio went down as low as 0.53 and as high as 1.89. Also, it is down from 62% of the total 186 rivals across the globe.  LMT traded at an unexpectedly high level on 01/12/2017 when the stock experienced a -1.74% loss to a closing price of $313.57. The company saw 1.71 million shares trade hands over the course of the day. Given that its average daily volume over the 30 days has been 1.01 million shares a day, this signifies a pretty significant change over the norm.  Analysts are speculating a 15.76% move, based on the high target price ($363) for the shares that is set to reach in the next 12 months. The analysts, on average, are forecasting a $327.77 price target, but the stock is already up 27.73% from its recent lows. However, the stock is trading at -2.68% versus recent highs ($322.19). Analysts believe that we could see stock price minimum in the $284 range (lowest target price), allowing for another -9.43% drop from its current position. Leading up to this report, we have seen a 2.27% rise in the stock price over the last 30 days and a 3.77% increase over the past 3 months. Overall, the share price is up 25.46% so far this year. Additionally, LMT had a day price range of $311.1301 to $319.63.  Heading into the stock price potential, Lockheed Martin Corporation needs to grow just 3.96% to cross its median price target of $326. In order to determine directional movement, the 50-day and 200-day moving averages for Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) are $313.78 and $298.92. Given that liquidity is king in short-term, LMT is a stock with 287.1 million shares outstanding that normally trades 0.73% of its float. The stock price recently experienced a 5-day loss of -0.71% with 3.67 average true range (ATR). LMT has a beta of 0.57 and RSI is 48.88.  Investors also need to beware of the SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) valuations. The stock trades on a P/S of 4.9, which suggests that the shares are attractive compared with peers. The broad Application Software industry has an average P/S ratio of 5.6, which is significantly worse than the sector’s 2.67. In the past 13-year record, this ratio went down as low as 2.48 and as high as 5.36. Also, it is down from 70% of the total 1840 rivals across the globe.  SAP SE by far traveled 37.49% versus a 1-year low price of $81.30. The share price was last seen -1.39% lower, reaching at $111.78 on Jan. 12, 2017. At recent session, the prices were hovering between $110.77 and $112.17. This company shares are 13.07% off its target price of $126.39 and the current market capitalization stands at $135.2B. The recent change has given its price a -0.76% deficit over SMA 50 and -4.38% deficit over its 52-week high. The stock witnessed -3.86% declines, 6.11% gains and 3.27% gains for the 1-month, 3-month and 6-month period, respectively. To measure price-variation, we found SAP’s volatility during a week at 1.19% and during a month it has been found around 0.94%.  SAP SE (SAP) exchanged hands at an unexpectedly high level of 0.66 million shares over the course of the day. Noting its average daily volume at 0.61 million shares each day over the month, this signifies a pretty significant change over the norm.  The market experts are predicting a 18.98% rally, based on the high target price ($133) for SAP SE shares that is likely to be hit in the 52 weeks. Analysts anticipate that traders could see stock price minimum in the $88.11 range (lowest target price). If faced, it would be a -21.18% drop from its current position. Overall, the share price is up 29.33% year to date.

http://www.nasdaq.com/article/lockheed-martins-lmt-unit-wins-102m-deal-from-us-navy-cm885358

 Lockheed Martin Corp. 's LMT business segment, Rotary and Missions Systems (RMS) has won a modification contract for exercising options to procure technical insertion (TI)-16 Acoustic Rapid Commercial Off-the-Shelf Insertion (A-RCI) systems, pre-cable kits and A-RCI sonar engineering services.Contract Details
 Valued at $102 million, this contract has been awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington Navy Yard, Washington, DC.
 The majority of the work will be carried out in Manassas, VA, while the rest will be executed in Clearwater, FL. The deal is expected to be complete by December 2018.
 Lockheed Martin will utilize fiscal 2018 shipbuilding and conversion (Navy), fiscal 2018 research and development test and evaluation, and fiscal 2018 other procurement (Navy) funds to complete the work.A Brief Note on A-RCI Systems
 A-RCI is an open-architecture sonar system that uses legacy sensors. It also replaces central processors with commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) computer technology and software within submarines.  This system helps the U.S. Navy in searching, detecting and tracking submarines and surface vessels in open-ocean and littoral sea environments without being counter-detected. It facilitates covert execution of Naval Special Warfare missions and under-ice operations as well.
 In the 1990s, Lockheed Martin unveiled A-RCI Systems, which allowed frequent hardware and software upgrades. The system was highly effective and offered improved acoustic quieting measures at a far lower cost than previously possible. Notably, the A-RCI TI 18-20 engineering services provide engineering development to support modernization requirements.Our View
 With the rapid rise in terrorist attacks over the last decade, the U.S. Navy's focus has shifted to littoral waters, the shallow areas near coastlines. These are the areas that it must patrol and defend against small subs, underwater mines and fast attack boats. Considering this, the need for timely detection and localization of quiet subs in the especially noisy shallow-water sonar field has made the ARCI submarine sonar system very much critical. Additionally, constant upgrades of the system have made it more valuable for the nation's naval base and an attractive choice of defense equipment for the U.S. allied countries.
 As geopolitical uncertainty continues to prevail across the globe, we expect renowned defense contractors like Lockheed Martin to win more such deals in the days to come. A quick peek into the company's third-quarter earnings numbers also reflects this. In particular, the RMS segment generated revenues of $3.4 billion in the third quarter, reflecting 27.9% of the company's total revenues.
 Moreover, the company's improved cash outlook for 2017 reflects enhanced cash performance at the Rotary and Mission Systems division. That said, the aforementioned contract gain has the potential to boost revenues at this segment.
 Furthermore, the fiscal 2018 defense policy has authorized the United States to spend $700 billion on defense. This has further enhanced the prospect of increased order flow from Pentagon for major defense contractors like Lockheed Martin, Raytheon Company RTN , Northrop Grumman Corporation NOC , The Boeing Company BA and others.Price Movement
 Lockheed Martin's stock was up about 19.8% in a year compared with the broader industry 's gain of 36%. This underperformance could have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces owing to its broad portfolio of products and services domestically as well as internationally.

Price Target A price target is the projected price level of a financial security stated by an investment analyst. It represents a security’s price that, if achieved, results in a trader recognizing the best possible outcome for his investment. This is the price at which the trader or investor wants to exit his existing position so he can realize the most reward. Basically, a price target is an individual analyst’s projection on the future price of a stock. There is no concrete way to calculate a price target. Different analysts and financial institutions use various valuation methods and consider different economic forces when deciding on a price target. Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT) has been given an average price target of $328.85 from analysts, according to data collected by Finviz. Earnings Forecast Earnings per share (EPS) is the portion of a company’s profit allocated to each outstanding share of common stock. Earnings per share serves as an indicator of a company’s profitability. Consensus earnings estimates are far from perfect, but they are watched by many investors and play an important role in measuring the appropriate valuation for a stock. Investors measure stock performance on the basis of a company’s earnings power. To make a proper assessment, investors seek a sound estimate of this year’s and next year’s earnings per share (EPS), as well as a strong sense of how much the company will earn even farther down the road. Maximum and minimum EPS estimate for the current quarter is projected at $4.17 and $3.67, respectively, according to 19 analysts. Comparatively, Lockheed Martin Corporation posted earnings of $3.51 per share in the same quarter last year. The company is expected to report earnings of $4.03 a share for the next quarter.

The high and low revenue estimates for the current quarter are $14.99 Billion and $14.41 Billion, respectively. The company reported revenue of $13.69 Billion in the same period last year. Moving Averages A moving average (MA) is a trend-following or lagging indicator because it is based on past prices. The average is taken over a specific period of time, like 10 days, 20 minutes, 30 weeks, or any time period the trader chooses. There are advantages to using a moving average in your trading, as well options on what type of moving average to use. Moving average strategies are also popular and can be tailored to any time frame, suiting both long term investors and short-term traders. A moving average can help cut down the amount of “noise” on a price chart. Look at the direction of the moving average to get a basic idea of which way the price is moving. Angled up and price is moving up (or was recently) overall, angled down and price is moving down overall, moving sideways and the price is likely in a range.

Volatility can either be measured by using the standard deviation or variance between returns from that same security or market index. When we see the company’s Volatility, it currently has a monthly volatility of 1.05% and weekly volatility of 1.21%. Analysts Recommendation In order to reach an opinion and communicate the value and volatility of a covered security, analysts research public financial statements, listen in on conference calls and talk to managers and the customers of a company, typically in an attempt to capture the findings for a research report. Ultimately, through all this investigation into the company’s performance the analyst decides whether their stock is a “buy,” sell” or hold.” Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT) has an Analysts’ Mean Recommendation of 2.3, according to data compiled by Finviz.

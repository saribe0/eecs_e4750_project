Shares of semiconductor stocks as a group suffered losses last week, with the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NYSEARCA:SMH) dropping nearly 6% for its worst one-week slide in 2017 thus far. Within this group shares of Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) as a result have finally had a chance to work down the severe near-term overbought readings and are also arriving at a better technical area of support. Traders and active investors would be wise to take note, for a next bullish trade looks to be setting up very soon. The technology sector of the S&P 500 as a whole has performed notably well again in 2017, and within this sector semiconductors have showed outstanding performance. The medium- and longer-term up-trends in this space remain well intact despite last week’s hiccup, which is to say that a buying opportunity should be just around the corner.

Through this lens, what has been missing for me in order to add to long positions in MU stock is some sort of a re-test of this previous horizontal technical resistance area so as to prove its worth as technical support. With last week’s drop, MU shares are now undergoing such a mean-reversion process which, however, could see lower prices still before a next rally.

From a momentum perspective MU stock could easily have more downside into the middle of this channel and toward its blue 100-day moving average in the $37 area, however given the stock’s popularity and the year-end dynamics of fund managers chasing stocks, it is possible that we see a next bullish reversal closer to the $40-$42 area.

https://www.stocknewsjournal.com/2017/12/04/checking-the-overall-picture-for-micron-technology-inc-mu-11/

Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) is an interesting player in the Technology space, with a focus on Semiconductor- Memory Chips. The stock has been active on the tape, currently trading at $41.99, down from yesterday’s close by -0.94%. Given the stock’s recent action, it seemed like a good time to take a closer look at the company’s recent data. Fundamental Analysis Does this stock stack up well when compared to its peers in the industry space? Let’s take a look. Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) currently trades with a market capitalization of $49.97 Billion. That value represents a market adjusting for revenues that have been growing by 90.80 % on a quarterly year/year basis as of the company’s last quarterly report. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For MU, the company currently has $4.63 Billion of cash on the books, which is offset by $1.26 Billion current liabilities. You can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $3.43 Billion over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to fall in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $2.19 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 81.08% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors. Technical Analysis We’ve taken a serious look at this stock from a fundamental perspective, but the tale of the tape may offer more hints about what lies under the surface. Looking at the stock’s movement on the chart, Micron Technology, Inc. recorded a 52-week high of $49.89. It is now trading 7.9% off that level. The stock is trading $42.46 its 50-day moving average by 0.47%. The stock carved out a 52-week low down at $18.18. In recent action, Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) has made a move of -5.30% over the past month, which has come on Strong relative transaction volume. Over the trailing year, the stock is underperforming the S&P 500 by 20.09, and it’s gotten there by action that has been more volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. In terms of the mechanics underlying that movement, traders will want to note that the stock is trading on a float of 4.87% with $1.10 Billion sitting short, betting on future declines. That suggests something of the likelihood of a short squeeze in shares of MU.

https://www.stocknewsgazette.com/2017/12/04/a-side-by-side-analysis-of-micron-technology-inc-mu-and-rambus-inc-rmbs/

Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) shares are up more than 91.56% this year and recently decreased -0.94% or -$0.4 to settle at $41.99. Rambus Inc. (NASDAQ:RMBS), on the other hand, is up 7.84% year to date as of 12/01/2017. It currently trades at $14.85 and has returned -2.11% during the past week. Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) and Rambus Inc. (NASDAQ:RMBS) are the two most active stocks in the Semiconductor- Memory Chips industry based on today’s trading volumes. Investor interest in the two stocks is clearly very high, but which is the better investment? To answer this question, we will compare the two companies across growth, profitability, risk, and valuation metrics, and also examine their analyst ratings and insider activity trends. Growth One of the key things investors look for in a company is the ability to grow earnings at a high compound rate over time. Analysts expect MU to grow earnings at a 17.85% annual rate over the next 5 years. Comparatively, RMBS is expected to grow at a 15.00% annual rate. All else equal, MU’s higher growth rate would imply a greater potential for capital appreciation. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Profitability and Returns Growth isn’t very attractive to investors if companies are sacrificing profitability and shareholder returns to achieve that growth. We will use EBITDA margin and Return on Investment (ROI), which control for differences in capital structure between the two companies, to measure profitability and return., compared to an EBITDA margin of 23.68% for Rambus Inc. (RMBS). MU’s ROI is 19.20% while RMBS has a ROI of 2.50%. The interpretation is that MU’s business generates a higher return on investment than RMBS’s. Cash Flow  
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 If there’s one thing investors care more about than earnings, it’s cash flow. MU’s free cash flow (“FCF”) per share for the trailing twelve months was +1.63. Comparatively, RMBS’s free cash flow per share was +0.12. On a percent-of-sales basis, MU’s free cash flow was 9.25% while RMBS converted 0% of its revenues into cash flow. This means that, for a given level of sales, MU is able to generate more free cash flow for investors. Liquidity and Financial Risk Liquidity and leverage ratios are important because they reveal the financial health of a company. MU has a current ratio of 2.30 compared to 1.40 for RMBS. This means that MU can more easily cover its most immediate liabilities over the next twelve months. MU’s debt-to-equity ratio is 0.60 versus a D/E of 0.29 for RMBS. MU is therefore the more solvent of the two companies, and has lower financial risk. Valuation MU trades at a forward P/E of 6.20, a P/B of 2.50, and a P/S of 2.46, compared to a forward P/E of 20.51, a P/B of 2.76, and a P/S of 4.24 for RMBS. MU is the cheaper of the two stocks on an earnings, book value and sales basis. Given that earnings are what matter most to investors, analysts tend to place a greater weight on the P/E. Analyst Price Targets and Opinions When investing it’s crucial to distinguish between price and value. As Warren Buffet said, “price is what you pay, value is what you get”. MU is currently priced at a -21.72% to its one-year price target of 53.64. Comparatively, RMBS is -9.34% relative to its price target of 16.38. This suggests that MU is the better investment over the next year. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 1.80 for MU and 2.20 for RMBS, which implies that analysts are more bullish on the outlook for RMBS. Risk and Volatility No discussion on value is complete without taking into account risk. Analysts use a stock’s beta, which measures the volatility of a stock compared to the overall market, to measure systematic risk. A stock with a beta above 1 is more volatile than the market. Conversely, a beta below 1 implies a below average level of risk. MU has a beta of 1.77 and RMBS’s beta is 0.75. RMBS’s shares are therefore the less volatile of the two stocks. Insider Activity and Investor Sentiment Short interest, or the percentage of a stock’s tradable shares currently being shorted, is another metric investors use to get a pulse on sentiment.MU has a short ratio of 1.50 compared to a short interest of 8.63 for RMBS. This implies that the market is currently less bearish on the outlook for MU. Summary Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) beats Rambus Inc. (NASDAQ:RMBS) on a total of 12 of the 14 factors compared between the two stocks. MU is growing fastly, is more profitable, generates a higher return on investment, has higher cash flow per share, has a higher cash conversion rate and higher liquidity. In terms of valuation, MU is the cheaper of the two stocks on an earnings, book value and sales basis, MU is more undervalued relative to its price target. Finally, MU has better sentiment signals based on short interest.

The West Virginia Board of Education will travel to Cabell County for two days of regular meetings Tuesday and Wednesday at Marshall University. The meetings, which are open to the public, will begin at 1 p.m. Tuesday and resume at 9 a.m. Wednesday in the Don Morris Room of the Memorial Student Center. The board's agenda covers regular actions statewide, and while no action expressly mentions Cabell County Schools, a handful of actions stand to influence partnerships with Marshall University as well ongoing facilty improvement plans in Wayne, Lincoln and Mason counties. After welcoming remarks by Marshall President Jerome Gilbert and Cabell County Superintendent of Schools Ryan Saxe, Tuesday's agenda features a proclamation from Gov. Jim Justice's office declaring the week to be Computer Science Education Week. The proclamation will be followed by the signing of a related partnership agreement between Marshall and the state Department of Education, though the full details of the agreement were not available prior to the meeting. The board will also vote whether to approve Marshall University's proposed expansion of its Teacher-in-Residence program to Logan County Schools. The proposal has been recommended by the West Virginia Educator Preparation Program Review Board, which includes similar student teaching expansions for Fairmont State University into Hampshire County and Bluefield State College in Mercer County. Facilities upgrades in Wayne, Lincoln and Mason are also up for a vote as part of their Comprehensive Educational Facilities Plans. In Wayne County, major renovations to Wayne High School are proposed as well as roof and HVAC renovations at Spring Valley High School. In Lincoln County, five schools may receive full or partial roof replacements if its proposal is approved. Schools affected are Midway Elementary School, Duval PreK-8 School, Ranger Elementary School, Guyan Valley Middle School and Hamlin PreK-8 School. For Mason County, the board will vote whether to approve replacing the fire alarm systems at Ashton Elementary School and Roosevelt Elementary School, as well as fund grounding protection against potential lightning damage at Point Pleasant High School and the Mason County Career Center. All three counties' proposals reach the board with the state Department of Education's recommendation. Meetings will resume Wednesday morning with the board considering a partnership to allow a U.S. Department of Defense grant to help renovate the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind in Romney, West Virginia. If approved, the DoD will provide pre-deployment military units specialized in construction and engineering to begin work on the school as part of its training. In allowing the units to work on the school with their own equipment and manpower, the state is projected to save approximately $750,000. The state will still provide building materials totaling approximately $320,000 toward the project. The day-two meeting will close out featuring a presentation by Teresa Eagle, dean of Marshall's College of Education and Professional Development, as well as a choral performance by Cabell Midland High School's Collegium Musicum. The state Board of Education will next meet Wednesday, Jan. 10, in Charleston. Follow reporter Bishop Nash on Twitter at @BishopNash. Sorry, there are no recent results for popular videos.

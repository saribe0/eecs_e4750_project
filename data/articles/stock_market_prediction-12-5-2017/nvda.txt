Shares in Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) have fallen 8% over the last five trading days as speculation rose  that the cryptocurrency “arms race” may be ending. Time to buy the dip? Analysts now predict a slowdown in sales to cryptocurrency “miners,”  who use fast graphics cards to find decryption keys for things like Bitcoin. This hit NVDA shares hard in the most recent trading week. The fall was possible because the valuation of Nvidia had become almost as divorced from gravity as Bitcoin itself. The stock is up 85% in the last year, and opened for trade on Dec. 4 at a price to earnings ratio of 49.4, against 15.6 for rival Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). When values are stretched, stocks become like balloons, rising and falling with the wind rather than fundamentals. The question for investors becomes, do the fundamentals of the stock make it worth buying? When I last wrote about Nvidia, on Nov. 7, I described those fundamentals as being related to a new buzzword called “fog computing.” Fog computing is important for Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, like self-driving cars, requiring fast chips on both the client and server end of the information transaction. When you tell your Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) Alexa device to play Jason Isbell’s If We Were Vampires from your music collection, the device in your home must find out whether you own the song, then access a stream of it, within a few seconds. Future applications of AI will require even more speed and coordination. That means faster clouds as well as more speed on clients. Nvidia Radeon chips, originally designed for graphics processing on video games, are perfect for this task. Thus, the bullish case states, expect huge orders from cloud providers upgrading to support these applications, and from client device makers delivering them. The bull case for Nvidia is clear. What about the bear case? Next Page Article printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2017/12/nvidia-corporation-nvda-stock-buy-the-dip/. ©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC

NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) is an interesting player in the Technology space, with a focus on Semiconductor – Specialized. The stock has been active on the tape, currently trading at $197.68, down from yesterday’s close by -1.51%. Given the stock’s recent action, it seemed like a good time to take a closer look at the company’s recent data. Fundamental Analysis Does this stock stack up well when compared to its peers in the industry space? Let’s take a look. NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) currently trades with a market capitalization of $117.23 Billion. That value represents a market adjusting for revenues that have been growing by 31.54 % on a quarterly year/year basis as of the company’s last quarterly report. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For NVDA, the company currently has $2.8 Billion of cash on the books, which is offset by $28 Million current liabilities. You can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $2.64 Billion over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to fall in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $1.15 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 66.94% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors. Technical Analysis Sometimes, we can understand most about a stock by simply looking at how it has been trading. Looking at the stock’s movement on the chart, NVIDIA Corporation recorded a 52-week high of $218.67. It is now trading 20.99% off that level. The stock is trading $198.10 its 50-day moving average by 0.41999999999999%. The stock carved out a 52-week low down at $84.77. In recent action, NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) has made a move of -4.01% over the past month, which has come on weak relative transaction volume. Over the trailing year, the stock is underperforming the S&P 500 by 20.09, and it’s gotten there by action that has been more volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. In terms of the mechanics underlying that movement, traders will want to note that the stock is trading on a float of 2.38% with $578.75 Million sitting short, betting on future declines. That suggests something of the likelihood of a short squeeze in shares of NVDA.

https://stocknewsgazette.com/2017/12/04/reliable-long-term-trend-to-profit-from-nvidia-corporation-nvda-regions-financial-corporation-rf/

The shares of NVIDIA Corporation have increased by more than 85.20% this year alone. The shares recently went down by -1.51% or -$3.03 and now trades at $197.68. The shares of Regions Financial Corporation (NYSE:RF), has jumped by 15.95% year to date as of 12/01/2017. The shares currently trade at $16.65 and have been able to report a change of 6.94% over the past one week. The stock of NVIDIA Corporation and Regions Financial Corporation were two of the most active stocks on Friday. Investors seem to be very interested in what happens to the stocks of these two companies but do investors favor one over the other? We will analyze the growth, profitability, risk, valuation, and insider trends of both companies and see which one investors prefer. Next 5Y EPS Growth: 15.45% versus 11.76% When a company is able to grow consistently in terms of earnings at a high compound rate have the highest likelihood of creating value for its shareholders over time. Analysts have predicted that NVDA will grow it’s earning at a 15.45% annual rate in the next 5 years. This is in contrast to RF which will have a positive growth at a 11.76% annual rate. This means that the higher growth rate of NVDA implies a greater potential for capital appreciation over the years. 
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Profitability and Returns Growth alone cannot be used to see if the company will be valuable. Shareholders will be the losers if a company invest in ventures that aren’t profitable enough to support upbeat growth. In order for us to accurately measure profitability and return, we will be using the EBITDA margin and Return on Investment (ROI), which balances the difference in capital structure. NVDA has an EBITDA margin of 34.6%, this implies that the underlying business of RF is more profitable. The ROI of NVDA is 19.80% while that of RF is 14.10%. These figures suggest that NVDA ventures generate a higher ROI than that of RF. Cash Flow  
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 The value of a stock is ultimately determined by the amount of cash flow that the investors have available. Over the last 12 months, NVDA’s free cash flow per share is a positive 14.04. Liquidity and Financial Risk The ability of a company to meet up with its short-term obligations and be able to clear its longer-term debts is measured using Liquidity and leverage ratios. The debt ratio of NVDA is 0.32 compared to 0.28 for RF. NVDA can be able to settle its long-term debts and thus is a lower financial risk than RF. Valuation NVDA currently trades at a forward P/E of 41.92, a P/B of 18.77, and a P/S of 13.06 while RF trades at a forward P/E of 14.70, a P/B of 1.25, and a P/S of 4.91. This means that looking at the earnings, book values and sales basis, RF is the cheaper one. It is very obvious that earnings are the most important factors to investors, thus analysts are most likely to place their bet on the P/E. Analyst Price Targets and Opinions The mistake some people make is that they think a cheap stock has more value to it. In order to know the value of a stock, there is need to compare its current price to its likely trading price in the future. The price of NVDA is currently at a -6.5% to its one-year price target of 211.43. Looking at its rival pricing, RF is at a 3.22% relative to its price target of 16.13. This figure implies that over the next one year, RF is a better investment. When looking at the investment recommendation on say a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell), NVDA is given a 2.30 while 2.90 placed for RF. This means that analysts are more bullish on the outlook for RF stocks. Insider Activity and Investor Sentiment Short interest or otherwise called the percentage of a stock’s tradable shares currently being shorted is another data that investors use to get a handle on sentiment. The short ratio for NVDA is 0.92 while that of RF is just 2.00. This means that analysts are more bullish on the forecast for NVDA stock. Conclusion The stock of Regions Financial Corporation defeats that of NVIDIA Corporation when the two are compared, with RF taking 5 out of the total factors that were been considered. RF happens to be more profitable, generates a higher ROI, has higher cash flow per share, higher liquidity and has a lower financial risk. When looking at the stock valuation, RF is the cheaper one on an earnings, book value and sales basis. Finally, the sentiment signal for RF is better on when it is viewed on short interest.

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Falls 5.57% Overall, the bias in prices is: Downwards. Short term: Prices are moving. Intermediate term: Prices are trending. The projected upper bound is: 198.91. The projected lower bound is: 174.71. The projected closing price is: 186.81.  Candlesticks A big black candle occurred. This is bearish, as prices closed significantly lower than they opened. If the candle appears when prices are “high,” it may be the first sign of a top. If it occurs when prices are confronting an overhead resistance area (e.g., a moving average, trendline, or price resistance level), the long black candle adds credibility to the resistance. Similarly, if the candle appears as prices break below a support area, the long black candle confirms the failure of the support area.
During the past 10 bars, there have been 4 white candles and 6 black candles for a net of 2 black candles. During the past 50 bars, there have been 25 white candles and 25 black candles. Momentum Indicators Momentum is a general term used to describe the speed at which prices move over a given time period. Generally, changes in momentum tend to lead to changes in prices. This expert shows the current values of four popular momentum indicators. Stochastic Oscillator One method of interpreting the Stochastic Oscillator is looking for overbought areas (above 80) and oversold areas (below 20). The Stochastic Oscillator is 21.9299. This is not an overbought or oversold reading. The last signal was a sell 5 period(s) ago. Relative Strength Index (RSI) The RSI shows overbought (above 70) and oversold (below 30) areas. The current value of the RSI is 33.08. This is not a topping or bottoming area. A buy or sell signal is generated when the RSI moves out of an overbought/oversold area. The last signal was a sell 14 period(s) ago. Commodity Channel Index (CCI) The CCI shows overbought (above 100) and oversold (below -100) areas. The current value of the CCI is -176.This is an oversold reading. However, a signal isn’t generated until the indicator crosses above -100. The last signal was a sell 5 period(s) ago. MACD The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence indicator (MACD) gives signals when it crosses its 9 period signal line. The last signal was a sell 13 period(s) ago.

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Falls 5.57% Overall, the bias in prices is: Downwards. Short term: Prices are moving. Intermediate term: Prices are trending. The projected upper bound is: 198.91. The projected lower bound is: 174.71. The projected closing price is: 186.81.  Candlesticks A big black candle occurred. This is bearish, as prices closed significantly lower than they opened. If the candle appears when prices are “high,” it may be the first sign of a top. If it occurs when prices are confronting an overhead resistance area (e.g., a moving average, trendline, or price resistance level), the long black candle adds credibility to the resistance. Similarly, if the candle appears as prices break below a support area, the long black candle confirms the failure of the support area.
During the past 10 bars, there have been 4 white candles and 6 black candles for a net of 2 black candles. During the past 50 bars, there have been 25 white candles and 25 black candles. Momentum Indicators Momentum is a general term used to describe the speed at which prices move over a given time period. Generally, changes in momentum tend to lead to changes in prices. This expert shows the current values of four popular momentum indicators. Stochastic Oscillator One method of interpreting the Stochastic Oscillator is looking for overbought areas (above 80) and oversold areas (below 20). The Stochastic Oscillator is 21.9299. This is not an overbought or oversold reading. The last signal was a sell 5 period(s) ago. Relative Strength Index (RSI) The RSI shows overbought (above 70) and oversold (below 30) areas. The current value of the RSI is 33.08. This is not a topping or bottoming area. A buy or sell signal is generated when the RSI moves out of an overbought/oversold area. The last signal was a sell 14 period(s) ago. Commodity Channel Index (CCI) The CCI shows overbought (above 100) and oversold (below -100) areas. The current value of the CCI is -176.This is an oversold reading. However, a signal isn’t generated until the indicator crosses above -100. The last signal was a sell 5 period(s) ago. MACD The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence indicator (MACD) gives signals when it crosses its 9 period signal line. The last signal was a sell 13 period(s) ago.

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) is having an overwhelmingly rough day in the market today. This comes as a bit of a surprise. The company actually released positive news. Nonetheless, the stock is taking a bit of a dive. Today, we'll talk about the news, what we're seeing from NVDA, and what we'll be watching for ahead. As mentioned above, the fact that NVDA is falling comes as a bit of a surprise after the company released pretty positive news this morning. In an early morning press release, the company announced that hundreds of thousands of AI researchers using desktop GPUs can now get their hands on the NVIDIA GPU Cloud, also known as NGC. This comes as the result of the company extending NGC support to NVIDIA Titan. On top of that news, NVDA also announced expanded NGC capabilities. In the announcement, we learned of new software as well as other key updates, all aimed at providing researchers a broader, more powerful set of tools. Ultimately, with these tools, researchers have the ability to advance their AI and high performance computing research and development efforts more efficiently. In a statement, Jim McHugh, vice president and general manager of enterprise systems at NVDA, had the following to offer: “We built NVIDIA GPU Cloud to give AI developers easy access to the software they need to do groundbreaking work... With GPU-optimized software now available to hundreds of thousands of researchers using NVIDIA desktop GPUs, NGC will be a catalyst for AI breakthroughs and a go-to resource for developers worldwide.” While the news released by NVDA proved to be overwhelmingly positive, we're seeing a bit of an adverse reaction in the market today. As is normally the case, our partners at Trade Ideas were the first to alert us to the movement. Currently (10:46), NVDA is trading at $187.11 per share after a loss of $10.57 per share or 5.35% thus far today. Stop wasting your time! Start finding winning trades in minutes with Trade Ideas! Moving forward, the CNA Finance team will continue to keep a close eye on NVDA. In particular, we're interested in following the story surrounding the NGC news and excited to see what the uptake is among the hundreds of thousands of researchers and developers that have the ability to take advantage of the technology. Nonetheless, we'll continue to follow the story closely and bring the news to you as it breaks! Do you want real-time, actionable news delivered to your inbox?

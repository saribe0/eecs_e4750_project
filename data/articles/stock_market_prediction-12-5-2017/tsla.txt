https://qz.com/1144383/tesla-tsla-just-officially-turned-on-one-of-the-worlds-largest-batteries-in-south-australia/

What started as a bet on Twitter by Tesla CEO Elon Musk is now a massive battery storing and dispatching power for South Australia. After blackouts darkened the entire region in 2016, the government needed a fix. Past solutions, such as natural gas “peaker” plants that spin up during periods of high demand, can take years and hundreds of millions of dollars to build. Lithium-ion batteries, now at the price and scale to back up entire power grids, were an obvious answer. In March, Musk offered a money-back guarantee on Twitter that Tesla could get a 100 megawatts of power capacity up and running within 100 days. Tesla will get the system installed and working 100 days from contract signature or it is free. That serious enough for you? — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 10, 2017 And so, nearly nine months later, it was ready. Today (Dec. 1) the Hornsdale Power Reserve battery system, connected to a nearby wind farm run, was officially turned on for the first time (it started supplying power yesterday, as hot weather increased demand). The battery array holds enough energy to supply more than 30,000 homes for about an hour in an emergency, and supply electricity during other periods. This is just the latest in a string of project by Tesla and others around the world deploying massive grid-scale batteries. Altagas, AES and Tesla deployed huge battery storage projects in Southern California this year in the wake of 2015 natural gas leak. Tesla built an emergency solar and battery system in Puerto Rico after a hurricane knocked out power to much of the island this year. Hawaii, New Zealand, UK and Pacific islands have all seen new systems come on line as well. Despite these achievements, battery makers face a feast or famine challenge in the utility storage market. With residential and commercial business small (but growing), quarterly revenues from battery storage markets gyrate along with the calls to patch holes in ailing grids, reports Greentech Media. That makes it hard to build a business. “You cannot have a business model that’s just waiting for these events to occur so you can jump in and be a savior,” said Ravi Manghani, energy storage director at GTM Research. What’s needed is a change in mindset and a change in markets. First, utility operators are still warming up to the idea (and price tag) of adding batteries to their electrical grids. Before now, batteries were only seen as a solution in extreme circumstances. That’s not the case anymore, John Zahurancik, AES’s president of battery storage, told Bloomberg. “This is my fifth time doing the largest project in the world for energy storage, and each time people tell me, ‘Well this is the test, this is really the test,’” he said in January. “The next big test is how do we scale this up broadly.” Price stands in the way. The economics of fossil-fuel peaker plants still edge out batteries in some cases. But that won’t last, as prices for renewable energy and battery storage continue their free-fall: lithium-ion batteries are just about half their price in 2014. The duo is expected to be cost competitive by 2025 by providing back-up power and services such as balancing the amount of electricity on electrical grids. Designing markets that pay for such services is another factor. The US, and other countries, have a mix of regulated electric markets (Texas, South Australia), and deregulated ones (California and others) where wholesale energy providers can bid on the supply of the cheapest, most reliable energy. Once more regulators embrace battery integration, allowing them to compete equally with legacy fuels, the economics of renewables plus storage should grow even more attractive.  Already, more than 95% of new energy-storage deployments in 2015 were lithium-ion technologies. Tesla, LG Chem, Panasonic (a Tesla partner), Mitsubishi, Samsung and many, many others are now positioning themselves to be the next generation of suppliers. Tesla is proving to be one of the biggest risk-takers by staking out huge projects like the one in Australia, and building out a massive internal demand for its own batteries through Tesla vehicles. Tesla, which dropped the word “motors” from its name earlier this year, told investors in May that its energy storage business is already scaling “several times” faster than its car line. The company expects to produce 15 gigawatt hours of battery storage a year in the 2020s. “We are an energy innovation company as much as a car company,” said Tesla CTO JB Straubel.

Lithium-ion revolution? Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) Elon Musk has beat today's 100-day deadline to install the world's biggest battery in South Australia, which will supply power to 30,000 homes. But he'll probably relinquish that crown by February. Hyundai Electric & Energy Systems is building a 150-megawatt unit, 50% larger than Musk's, that will go live in about three months in Ulsan, South Korea.

Every few months, I read about how Tesla, Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is in danger of falling off a cliff. After the TSLA stock price tumbled more than 20% in late September and October, Tesla bears are coming out of the woodwork again. Are they right this time? History says no, and so does the chart. In February, TSLA stock followed a long run-up with a pullback from $280 to $246 in less than two weeks. After running in place for all of March, TSLA broke to new all-time highs above $300 by the second week of April. In May, TSLA hit a new high of $325, only to quickly sink back to $303. Then in June, after the stock had rocketed as high as $383, it did a quick nosedive back to $308. By early August, TSLA had recovered most of those losses. So the latest dropoff — from $385 in the third week of September to as low as $299 in early November — is nothing new for the TSLA stock price. It’s up 44% this year despite three pullbacks of at least 10% and another correction of nearly 7%. That kind of volatility can be nerve-racking for the more conservative investor, but the end result will be the best year for TSLA stock since 2014. If Tesla follows the same pattern, it should climb as high as $400 in the second half of 2018. And from a technical standpoint, TSLA is setting up nicely for yet another leap forward. It’s been a month since the stock temporarily dipped below $300. Since then, it has stayed in a fairly tight range between $300 and $317. That kind of narrowing tends to lead to a breakout one way or the other. Given its history over the last year, my money’s on a break to the high side, probably within the next week or two. Of course, an encouraging chart isn’t the only thing Tesla has going for it. Sales are expected to pick up in the current quarter as production of the Model 3 — its first “affordable” electric car, with prices starting at $35,000 — finally picks up after a long delay.

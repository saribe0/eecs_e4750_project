 An intense competition that included a public vote has ended with an aurora-and-mountain theme for Alaska's official "Artistic License Plate."  And a 21-year-old from Palmer designed it.  The Alaska State Council on the Arts on Thursday revealed both the winning design and the artist behind it, Anita Laulainen. Judging was done with artists' names shielded to avoid any bias, said Andrea Noble-Pelant, arts council executive director.  Laulainen, who grew up in Palmer, is a senior in graphic design at the University of Alaska Anchorage.  She took on the project as a class assignment.  "We could decide whether or not we wanted to submit it," Laulainen said. "I thought: might as well."  She said she wanted to show the beauty and the romanticism of Alaska. She thought first of northern lights, then snowy mountains – harsh, forbidding, beautiful.  "I brainstormed how to incorporate the two together," she said. "Mostly it was just tweaking colors."  Some 142 Alaskans from around the state submitted designs earlier this year. A "celebrity jury" that included, among others, Alaska first lady Donna Walker, Iditarod musher Aliy Zirkle, artist Ray Troll, state Sen. Mia Costello and Rep. Jonathan Kreiss-Tomkins reviewed them all based on the quality of the design, readability for law enforcement and "imagery that celebrates aspects of our unique Alaskan identity," according to the arts council.  The jury winnowed the submissions to five — a raven, swimming salmon, a cache and fireweed, plus the aurora theme — for online voting. More than 17,000 Alaskans weighed in.  Kreiss-Tomkins was the House sponsor of a bill that set in motion the art plate competition.  "Nothing about Alaska is ordinary. If we have to print tiny rectangles of metal to hang on our cars, why shouldn't we make them as awesome as humanly possible?" his office said on the competition website.  Laulainen gets recognition, plus $1,000 for a design fee. She hopes to work in graphic design in Palmer or Anchorage after she graduates in the spring.  She said she spends her free time hiking, kayaking, running and just enjoying the Alaska outdoors.  "You can get high up in the mountains and you can be in the complete silence," Laulainen said.  She said she couldn't believe it when she won.  "It'll be crazy to finally see it on people's cars," she said.

ANCHORAGE, Alaska (KTUU) - Dimond High School’s Jahnna Hajdukovich on Monday held the ceremonial signing of her National Letter of Intent to play women's basketball at UAA. Basketball is the name of the game in the Hajdukovich family-- her father Jim Hajdukovich played for the Seawolves men’s team from 1995 to 1999. “My dad is in the hall of fame there (UAA), and has some records I'm hoping to break,” said Jahnna Monday. “That's the goal anyways, but that's not the only reason I went there.” It’s easy to see why the Dimond senior would want to join a program that is currently ranked second in the nation for NCAA Div. II women’s basketball, and just won its seventh Great Alaska Shootout title. "It's definitely intimidating, but I can't wait to jump into it,” said Hajdukovich. “I can't wait to contribute, and be a part of the program.” It’s also simple to see why UAA showed interest in Hajdukovich as well.   Her prep hoops resume includes being named to the all-state tournament team twice, and averaging 12.3 points per game at state.  The senior guard has just one thing missing from her resume: “I really want to be a state champ, that is my ultimate goal, and I think that me signing really gives me individual focus to help the team (Dimond).”

FAIRBANKS — The University of Alaska Fairbanks men’s and women’s Nordic ski team fell to in-state rival Alaska Anchorage in the 14th annual Nordic Cup on Sunday afternoon at Hatcher’s Pass.  UAA finished the two-day event in 4 hours, 49 minutes and 49.4 seconds, while UAF posted a total time of 4:56:10.5. On Sunday, the Seawolves’ mixed gender relay team of Marte Hakenstad-Braten, Hailey Swirbull, Tracen Knopp and Toomas Kollo won the 4x5-kilometer relay in 1:04:42.8 at the independence Mine Trails. The Nanooks’ mixed gender relay team consisting of Anna Darnell, Ann-Cathrin Uhl, Jan Cech and Arnaud Guyon took second, finishing the event in 1:04:59.5 Alaska Anchorage also finished third in 1:06:21.0, though Alaska’s second relay team, which features Anja Maijala, Hannah Dueling, Seiji Takagi and Max Donaldson, took fourth in 1:06:28.7. On Saturday, the rivals competed in the individual-start 10/7.5km classic race. The Seawolves’ top men’s team captured first in the 10km with a time of 88:23.6, while the Nanooks’ top squad finished in 88:50.4. Anchorage’s top three women tallied a time of 70:22.0 in the 7.5km, and Alaska’s completed the course in 75:51.9. “I’ve got to give credit to UAA and their coaching staff because they have a much stronger team than what we’ve faced in recent years, especially on the women’s side,” Nanooks head coach Nick Crawford said Saturday in UAF news release. “Their last two years of recruiting have been very successful and I expect that they’ll have a very good season ahead.” Alaska’s men were led by redshirt senior Jan Cech, who took second among college skiers and third overall with a time of 20:19.5. Senior Seiji Takagi (29:41.0) finished fifth overall and classmate Alexander Eckert (29:49.9) captured seventh. In the women’s race, Uhl finished sixth overall after completing the 7.5km course in 24:54.8. Kati Roivas (24:59.2) and Darnell (25:57.9) finished seventh and 10th overall, respectively.  The Nanooks will return to the trails after Christmas break, as they’ll compete in the U.S. Cross Country National Championships on Jan. 3 and 5 at the Kincaid Park Trails in Anchorage.  Contact News-Miner sports writer Brad Joyal at 459-7530.

ANCHORAGE, Alaska (KTUU) - Numbers from the state show the health care industry is projected to continue as one of the top areas for job growth through 2024. While job growth is good, some in the nursing field say meeting the demand for registered nurses can be challenging. As students at University of Alaska Anchorage's School of Nursing are learning how to work with patients, it's knowledge upcoming graduates aim to put to good use in the work force. Christina Egger says her hope is to work at Alaska Native Medical Center in one of their critical care departments. She loves what she's learning.  "I love that it's always changing and the group of people that I'm working with are supportive and helpful and they really encourage me to do my best, and interaction with the patients and talking to people every day and seeing different cases," Egger said. Danielle Carlson hopes to work in Providence hospital's pediatric ICU, and says nurses play an important role in patient care. "We are one-on-one with that patient the most amount of time during the day and we get to know their personalities, we see them at their worst and we see them at their best," Carlson said. Arylis Scates said his goal is to work with Alaska Regional Hospital. Scates said it takes a lot of work and commitment to become a nurse.  "I think nursing in general is difficult," Scates said. "Getting your license is a difficult thing to get, it takes a lot of work a lot of time into it. It's not something that you can just go to school and passively work your way through you know, 'Cs get degrees,' kind of thing, it takes effort," Scates said. The demand for nurses is expected to grow over the next seven years, according to Marianne Murray, director for UAA's School of Nursing. "With our population getting older, we have a lot more need for sometimes high delivery of care into our outreach areas and long-term care facilities, which also require nursing care," Murray said. "Some of our nurses are getting older so from the projections it looks like we'll have about 5-6 percent of our nurses retire, so we also have to fill those needs as the nurses retire ."  Murray said there are some specific areas of need. "Our small rural areas where we have our critical access hospitals, some of them are staffed with a lot of traveling nurses or nurses from other states because we don't have the Alaskan graduates to actually fill the spots," Murray said. "Another kind of need for nursing is specific nursing roles such as behavioral health nurses, nurses in I.C.U., E.R., those kind of areas." While it may not be for everyone, for those who have the passion, it's a field with promising career prospects.

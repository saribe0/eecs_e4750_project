Most of the investors recently have been curious over the performance of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) stock. Analysts often use price and volume data to predict future stock performance. In the case of WMT, the chart has some interesting things to say about where the stock might be headed. How has the stock performed recently? Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) in the last month has increased +11.74%. Shares are now up over the past year, outperforming the broad market by -100% and outperformed a peer group of similar companies by 316%.

     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
 Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that WMT may be headed in the future. To forecast a stock’s future performance, analysts use momentum indicators, which take into account the size and speed of these price movements. As momentum begins to slow, it may be a sign that a recent trend is about to reverse. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for WMT is 71.19%, which suggests that the stock may be primed for a trend reversal or a corrective pullback in price. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 76.68%, tells a similar story, and suggests that WMT currently trades in overbought territory. What do the trading volumes reveal? Price isn’t the only tool analysts use to forecast future performance. Volume patterns can also reveal some important insights. If, for instance, a stock’s volumes suddenly increase by a significant amount, it’s usually a sign that the level of conviction behind the trade is high. Investors may feel very strongly about the future direction of the stock in question. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) average trading volume of 10,492,370 during the past month is 17.57% above its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been more active than usual in the stock in recent times. What do the analysts think? WMT is currently undervalued by -2.38% relative to the average 1-year price target of $99.94 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 2.40, which implies that analysts are generally neutral in their outlook for WMT over the next year. How risky is the stock?  When predicting the future performance for a stock, it’s also important to take into account risk. To do this, analysts often use a stock’s beta, which measures the stock’s volatility relative to the overall market. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has a beta of 0.34, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are less extreme than the market as a whole. WMT therefore has a below average level of market risk. During the past couple of weeks, WMT average daily volatility was 44.68%, which is -22.17 percentage points higher than the average volatility over the past 100 days.

Consistently, one of the more popular stocks people enter into their stock options watchlist  at Stock Options Channel is Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (Symbol: WMT). So this week we highlight one interesting put contract, and one interesting call contract, from the January 2019 expiration for WMT. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting, is at the $82.50 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $3.15. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 3.8% return against the $82.50 commitment, or a 3.3% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost  ).      Selling a put does not give an investor access to WMT's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. So unless Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. sees its shares decline 14.8% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $79.35 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $3.15 from $82.50), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 3.3% annualized rate of return.  makeArticleAd();  Worth considering, is that the annualized 3.3% figure actually exceeds the 2.1% annualized dividend paid by Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. by 1.2%, based on the current share price of $96.66. And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to fall 14.85% to reach the $82.50 strike price.    Always important when discussing dividends is the fact that, in general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., looking at the dividend history chart for WMT below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 2.1% annualized dividend yield.    Turning to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the January 2019 expiration, for shareholders of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (Symbol: WMT) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 2.1% annualized dividend yield. Selling the covered call at the $110 strike and collecting the premium based on the $3.30 bid, annualizes to an additional 3% rate of return against the current stock price (this is what we at Stock Options Channel refer to as the YieldBoost  ), for a total of 5.1% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $110 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but WMT shares would have to advance 13.5% from current levels for that to occur, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 16.9% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.    The chart below shows the trailing twelve month trading history for Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., highlighting in green where the $82.50 strike is located relative to that history, and highlighting the $110 strike in red:       The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2019 put or call options highlighted in this article deliver a rate of return that represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (considering the last 252 trading day WMT historical stock prices  using closing values, as well as today's price of $96.66) to be 18%.    In mid-afternoon trading on Monday, the put volume among S&P 500 components was 854,085 contracts, with call volume at 1.49M, for a put:call ratio of 0.57 so far for the day. Compared to the long-term median put:call ratio of .65, that represents high call volume relative to puts; in other words, buyers are showing a preference for calls in  options trading  so far today.

Consistently, one of the more popular stocks people enter into their stock options watchlist  at Stock Options Channel is McDonald's Corp (Symbol: MCD). So this week we highlight one interesting put contract, and one interesting call contract, from the January 2019 expiration for MCD. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting, is at the $115 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $1.30. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 1.1% return against the $115 commitment, or a 1% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost  ).      Selling a put does not give an investor access to MCD's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. So unless McDonald's Corp sees its shares fall 31.6% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $113.70 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $1.30 from $115), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 1% annualized rate of return. Turning to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the January 2019 expiration, for shareholders of McDonald's Corp (Symbol: MCD) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 2.4% annualized dividend yield. Selling the covered call at the $190 strike and collecting the premium based on the $3.80 bid, annualizes to an additional 2% rate of return against the current stock price (this is what we at Stock Options Channel refer to as the YieldBoost  ), for a total of 4.4% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $190 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but MCD shares would have to advance 12.9% from current levels for that to happen, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 15.2% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.makeArticleAd();    The chart below shows the trailing twelve month trading history for McDonald's Corp, highlighting in green where the $115 strike is located relative to that history, and highlighting the $190 strike in red:       The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2019 put or call options highlighted in this article deliver a rate of return that represents good reward for the risks.

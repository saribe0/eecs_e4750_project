Prediction Method 7: 
Naive Bayes Classifier -> Requires word weight option 2 is loaded.
P(Word=w|Label=y) = (count(w,y)+c) / ([total number of words with label y] + c * vocabulary size). 
Value for label: log(P(y, word1, word2, ... wordn)) = log(P(y)) + log(P(word1 | y)) + log(P(word2 | y)) + ... + log(P(wordn | y)). 
Label (Up or Down) with the greatest value is chosen.

Predictions Based On: 
- Total Up Days    : 222
- Total Down Days  : 211
- Total Up Words   : 38969

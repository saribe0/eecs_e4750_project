Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that AMAT may be headed in the future. To do this, analysts often study the speed and magnitude of a stock’s price movements with what are known as momentum indicators. The logic is that as a stock’s momentum slows, it may be nearing key support or resistance levels and possibly the end of a current trend. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for AMAT is 71.07%, which suggests that the stock may be primed for a trend reversal or a corrective pullback in price. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 88.62%, tells a similar story, and suggests that AMAT currently trades in overbought territory.What do the trading volumes reveal?Volume patterns are useful for gauging the level of conviction behind price changes, and can be used to make predictions about future price movements. A sudden increase in a stock’s activity can be a sign that investors are trading in anticipation of a catalyst, or that investors feel very strongly in one way or the other about the future direction of a stock. Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT) average trading volume of 10,523,640 during the past month is 6.72% above its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been more active than usual in the stock in recent times.What do the analysts think?AMAT is currently undervalued by -5.04% relative to the average 1-year price target of $58.90 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 1.80, which implies that analysts are generally bullish in their outlook for AMAT over the next year.How risky is the stock? When predicting the future performance for a stock, it’s also important to take into account risk. To do this, analysts often use a stock’s beta, which measures the stock’s volatility relative to the overall market.Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) has a beta of 1.83, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are more extreme than the market as a whole. AMAT therefore has a above average level of market risk. During the past couple of weeks, AMAT average daily volatility was 14.11%, which is 14.16 percentage points lower than the average volatility over the past 100 days.

Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) shares are up more than 73.32% this year and recently increased 1.14% or $0.63 to settle at $55.93. Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX), on the other hand, is up 95.57% year to date as of 10/26/2017. It currently trades at $206.78 and has returned 2.89% during the past week.Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) and Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) are the two most active stocks in the Semiconductor Equipment & Materials industry based on today’s trading volumes. We will compare the two companies based on the strength of various metrics, including growth, profitability, risk, return, and valuation to determine if one is a better investment than the other.GrowthThe ability to grow earnings at a compound rate over time is a crucial determinant of investment value. Analysts expect AMAT to grow earnings at a 28.63% annual rate over the next 5 years. Comparatively, LRCX is expected to grow at a 17.70% annual rate. All else equal, AMAT’s higher growth rate would imply a greater potential for capital appreciation.
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
Profitability and ReturnsGrowth isn’t very attractive to investors if companies are sacrificing profitability and shareholder returns to achieve that growth. We will use EBITDA margin and Return on Investment (ROI), which control for differences in capital structure between the two companies, to measure profitability and return., compared to an EBITDA margin of 28.68% for Lam Research Corporation (LRCX). AMAT’s ROI is 17.30% while LRCX has a ROI of 18.10%. The interpretation is that LRCX’s business generates a higher return on investment than AMAT’s.Cash Flow 
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
The value of a stock is simply the present value of its future free cash flows. AMAT’s free cash flow (“FCF”) per share for the trailing twelve months was +1.09. Comparatively, LRCX’s free cash flow per share was +3.95. On a percent-of-sales basis, AMAT’s free cash flow was 10.74% while LRCX converted 7.98% of its revenues into cash flow. This means that, for a given level of sales, AMAT is able to generate more free cash flow for investors.Liquidity and Financial RiskLiquidity and leverage ratios measure a company’s ability to meet short-term obligations and longer-term debts. AMAT has a current ratio of 2.90 compared to 3.10 for LRCX. This means that LRCX can more easily cover its most immediate liabilities over the next twelve months. AMAT’s debt-to-equity ratio is 0.61 versus a D/E of 0.42 for LRCX. AMAT is therefore the more solvent of the two companies, and has lower financial risk.ValuationAMAT trades at a forward P/E of 15.30, a P/B of 6.87, and a P/S of 4.32, compared to a forward P/E of 13.80, a P/B of 4.92, and a P/S of 3.71 for LRCX. AMAT is the expensive of the two stocks on an earnings, book value and sales basis. Given that earnings are what matter most to investors, analysts tend to place a greater weight on the P/E.Analyst Price Targets and OpinionsInvestors often compare a stock’s current price to an analyst price target to get a sense of the potential upside within the next year. AMAT is currently priced at a -5.04% to its one-year price target of 58.90. Comparatively, LRCX is -8.52% relative to its price target of 226.05. This suggests that LRCX is the better investment over the next year.The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 1.80 for AMAT and 2.00 for LRCX, which implies that analysts are more bullish on the outlook for LRCX.Risk and VolatilityBeta is an important measure that gives investors a sense of the market risk associated with a particular stock. A beta above 1 signals above average market risk, while a beta below 1 implies below average volatility. AMAT has a beta of 1.83 and LRCX’s beta is 1.64. LRCX’s shares are therefore the less volatile of the two stocks.Insider Activity and Investor SentimentThe analysis of insider buying and selling trends can be extended to the aggregate level. Short interest, which represents the percentage of a stock’s tradable shares currently being shorted, captures what the market as a whole feels about a stock. AMAT has a short ratio of 1.40 compared to a short interest of 4.67 for LRCX. This implies that the market is currently less bearish on the outlook for AMAT.SummaryLam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) beats Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) on a total of 9 of the 14 factors compared between the two stocks. LRCX is growing fastly, has higher cash flow per share, higher liquidity and has lower financial risk.

      ’ Analyst Day and the company delivered.Attendance this year, Applied Materials’ (ticker: AMAT) 50th anniversary, was one third higher than last year and last year was an all-time attendance record. I interpret that high attendance as highly confirming of the investment community’s increased interest in and focus on Applied Materials specifically, and the wafer fabrication equipment (WFE) sector broadly. The sector is going thru a secular shift and the investment and sell-side community are both sensing and witnessing it.Artificial intelligence (AI) deserves a special mention in terms of being a burgeoning demand driver. A few highly salient points were made at the Analyst Day on the AI front and there was a whole panel discussion focused on AI.First, there are 10 times fewer chips per wafer for leading AI chips than for other standard chips. AI chips are big and incredibly robust and sophisticated. Second, while data growth is explosive, it is estimated that less than 1% of data is being analyzed. The amount of computing power and semiconductors/silicon necessary to start meaningfully analyzing all the data being generated in the world is enormous. Third, just looking at the amount of additional memory and computing power necessary for autonomous driving suggests exponential demand growth for 3D NAND with only 1% adoption of autonomous vehicles. Fourth, the shift from traditional enterprise servers to AI graphics processing unit (GPU)-based servers require eight times more logic per server and 4x more memory.Old expectations of how much share of WFE would go to lithography-based solutions (which would be particularly beneficial to

       (LRCX) and Tokyo Electron) have been meaningfully off the mark. Back in 2011 lithography equipment represented 25% of WFE spending and it was forecasted (by Gartner) to rise to 30%-plus by 2016). Today, lithography spending is less than 20% of total WFE spending. There are so many more steps and tools necessary in making cutting-edge semis, and lithography, while still critical, has become a lesser component of total spend. The outlook of multiyear visibility of highly robust demand and the need for the transition to advanced tools has arguably never looked better.The sell side has been consistently behind in its forecasts on Applied Materials. While the sell side is likely to inevitably catch up, the market is unlikely to wait for the laggards. Notably, the market has reacted with alacrity as it has digested Applied Materials’ presentation. The stock is up over 13% from the close on the day before the Analyst Day and appears to have broken out of the consolidation mode it had been in over the last few months despite reporting a tremendous fiscal third-quarter results and outlook in August.I believe that Applied Materials deserves to trade at at least a market multiple and more appropriately at a modest premium to a market multiple. I believe Applied Materials’ double-digit multiyear top-line forecasts combined with a likely 16%-plus multiyear earnings per share compounded annualized growth rate (CAGR), leading market position and it being one of the least-expensive ways to gain exposure to some of the most compelling trends in technology (AI, Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data, Cloud, Mobile, Smart Cars, Virtual/Augmented Reality, OLED, 68”-plus displays, etc.) suggests that Applied Materials warrants a 20 times EPS multiple on 2019 earnings. As I believe Applied Materials is likely to deliver about $5 in 2019 EPS, that suggests a warranted price for Applied Materials of $100 per share sometime in the next 12-24 months.

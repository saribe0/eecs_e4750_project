Amazon (Shutterstock photo)Two days ago, after UPS (UPS) beat earnings expectations, I wrote an article that suggested buying Amazon (AMZN) ahead of earnings. I was pleased to see the massive beat that they reported yesterday, but when that is combined with some other news from yesterday, it is clear that you should hang on to at least some of that stock for the long term.Earnings dominated yesterday’s news, with well over three hundred public companies reporting their results for the third quarter. There can be no doubt as to the big winners in earnings yesterday. Two other giant U.S. tech companies, Alphabet (GOOG: GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) joined Amazon in beating expectations by wide margins, but there were plenty of other stories to consider.We heard that CVS (CVS) is trying to buy health insurer Aetna (AET) in a reportedly $66 billion deal, and department store JC Penney (JCP) released yet another gloomy outlook.There was a flood of seemingly unrelated news from multiple sources, but those stories can all be connected through Amazon.The most obvious connection is that between Amazon and the two companies whose main business is retail, CVS and JCP. There is a common narrative that says that Amazon is destroying traditional retail right now, but that is not strictly accurate. They are dominant in e-commerce for sure, but still only account for a small percentage of total U.S. retail sales, and are significantly smaller in that regard than somebody like Wal-Mart (WMT).What is really causing ructions is not Amazon’s current market share, but fear of what is to come.The move by CVS, for example, could be just another example of consolidation by vertical integration that has become all the rage in the healthcare market rather than as having anything to do with Amazon. The healthcare system in the U.S. leads the world by far in terms of costs and yet is way down the list in terms of outcomes, and that has been the case for decades, so something has to change.Consolidation is, according to the companies involved, a way of improving efficiency and the patient experience, although more cynical minds may look at it as an attempt to become too big to fail before the finger of blame points in their direction.Merging CVS, who started as a retail company but is already involved in service delivery (Minute Clinics) and pharmacy benefit management, with an insurer makes sense on several levels not related to Amazon. However, it cannot be a coincidence that the idea is floated as it becomes increasingly clear that Bezos et al are about to get into the retail pharmacy business.What is driving things here is not Amazon’s current presence or market share, but fear of what they may and could do to profitability.That fear is justified. What Amazon has shown in the past is that they are quite prepared to operate on razor-thin margins to fund growth, and that the market is quite happy with that situation. The operating margin of under 1% that Amazon “achieved” this quarter would sink many other stocks, even in growth-oriented companies, but Amazon is, rightfully, given a pass on that by investors.I have pointed out before that what many miss when they talk about the so called “Amazon model,” where profits don’t matter and growth is pursued constantly, is that Amazon has shown in the past that they can turn on the profit tap, seemingly at will. From 2007-2010, as the recession hit retail hard, they more than doubled their profits before going back to massive investment and often losses in the following years.That ability makes growth at Amazon even more valuable.I cannot say that their impressive report came as a surprise, as is obvious from the above referenced article.  What did, though, was the extent to which nearly every corporate news story that broke yesterday is connected to Amazon’s performance and growth. Some might argue that ultimately that will not prove to be healthy, but what it says right now is that AMZN still has a lot more upside, and that yesterday’s jump in the stock is just the beginning.

Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) reminded Wall Street last night that it is still a growth powerhouse … at least on the revenue side of things. But then, sales growth has never really been a problem for Amazon.The company has seen revenue rise by more than 20% annually for the past five years. Amazon’s problem has always been spending, and regardless of today’s AMZN stock rally, you can the results clearly in the company’s earnings.Prior to last quarter, Amazon had posted net income growth for eight straight quarters. That winning streak ended in July, as Amazon increased spending on content for Amazon Prime Video and shelled out $13.7 billion for Whole Foods.Still, third-quarter earnings results were better than expected — including spending. Amazon said it earned 52 cents per share, and, while not a gain, results were flat with the same quarter last year. Analysts were expecting heavier spending, with earnings forecasts looking for a profit in a range of 2 cents to 7 cents per share, depending on who you ask.While spending will remain a concern heading into 2018, it looks like Amazon has things under control for the time being. And that’s a major boon heading into the holiday shopping season … and for AMZN stock options traders.Sentiment is only growing stronger on Amazon stock. The brokerage community emerged this morning to flood the shares with AMZN stock price target increases:What’s more, Amazon has also scored at least a pair of ratings upgrades from Raymond James (to outperform from market perform) and Monness Crespi Hardt (to buy from neutral). Overall, Thomson/First Call reports that 39 of the 44 analysts following AMZN stock have given it a “buy” or better.
Click to Enlarge That’s a lot of bullish sentiment that would give any contrarian cause for concern. But AMZN stock technicals are still backing the bullish line.The shares opened more than 9% higher this morning, putting Amazon stock above former resistance at $1,050. Given the shares’ momentum, $1,100 could be well within AMZN’s reach by the end of the year — if not the end of next month.Next PageArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2017/10/amazon-com-inc-amzn-stock-rally-earnings/.©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC

Recent price movements in the stock of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) have caught the attention of the investment community. Analysts often use price and volume data to predict future stock performance. In the case of AMZN, the chart has some interesting things to say about where the stock might be headed.How has the stock performed recently?Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the last month has increased +1.68%. Shares are now up over the past year, outperforming the broad market by -100% and underperformed a peer group of similar companies by -33%. After the latest session, which saw the stock close at a price of $972.43, AMZN sits below its 52-week high. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been trading in a bullish manner, based on the relative positions of the stock’s 20 and 200 day moving averages.Momentum indicators
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
Of course, these surface-level price movements don’t tell us much about the direction that AMZN may be headed in the future. To do this, analysts often study the speed and magnitude of a stock’s price movements with what are known as momentum indicators. The logic is that as a stock’s momentum slows, it may be nearing key support or resistance levels and possibly the end of a current trend. Two such indicators are the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the Stochastic %k Oscillator, which fluctuate on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overvalued, and a reading below 30 implies that it is undervalued. The 20-day RSI for AMZN is 47.59%, which suggests that the stock is not particularly expensive or cheap, and not predisposed to a reactive price movement based on this measure. The 20-day Stochastic %k measure, which sits at 34.50%, tells a similar story, and suggests that AMZN currently trades in neutral territory.What do the trading volumes reveal?In addition to price, analysts use volume trends to predict future performance. The level of trading activity in a stock is often a good proxy for the level of interest and enthusiasm for the name within the investment community. A sudden increase in activity can be a sign that investors are trading in anticipation of a catalyst. Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) average trading volume of 2,960,115 during the past month is 14.75% below its average volume over the past year, indicating that investors have been less active than usual in the stock in recent times.What do the analysts think?AMZN is currently undervalued by -16.39% relative to the average 1-year price target of $1163.10 taken from a group of Wall Street Analysts. The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 1.80, which implies that analysts are generally bullish in their outlook for AMZN over the next year.How risky is the stock? No study on the valuation of a stock is complete without taking into account risk. When analyzing the systematic risk associated with a stock, analysts look at beta, which measures the stock’s volatility relative to the overall market.Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has a beta of 1.43, compared to a beta of 1 for the market, which implies that the stock’s price movements are more extreme than the market as a whole. AMZN therefore has a above average level of market risk. During the past couple of weeks, AMZN average daily volatility was 11.85%, which is 5.11 percentage points lower than the average volatility over the past 100 days.

Shares of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) soared about 7% in after-hours trading on Thursday after the company reported its latest batch of earnings that came in well above analyst forecasts. While I like AMZN stock into year-end, the question is whether this here now is the time to buy the stock right after the earnings report. Let’s have a look.There is no question about it, right now Amazon can hardly do anything wrong for investors, which is once again exemplified with Thursday’s after-hours reaction in the stock. And to be clear, I like AMZN stock for the longer term, which is to say that in my eye having a core long position in the stock makes sense … at least for the time being.In fact, trying to “time” a stock like AMZN in this rampant of a bull market doesn’t make sense for the crowd of investors, but for the more active types this is where some alpha can be generated.

https://qz.com/1113795/amazon-amzn-just-explained-how-whole-foods-fits-into-its-plan-for-world-domination/

There was a rather remarkable moment on Amazon’s third-quarter earnings call yesterday (Oct. 26) where Brian Olsavsky, the company’s chief financial officer, laid out everything Amazon thinks it can do with its $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods Market.Olsavsky’s answer came in response to a question from Douglas Anmuth, an analyst at J.P. Morgan Securities, on whether Amazon had considered using Whole Foods’ more than 400 brick-and-mortar stores to establish a physical pharmacy presence, which it has reportedly received wholesale licensing for in at least 12 states. At first it seemed like Olsavsky would only decline to comment on Amazon’s rumored pharmacy ambitions. But then he continued:I will say we do see a lot of opportunity with Whole Foods. As I said, there’ll be a lot of work together between Prime Now, AmazonFresh, Whole Foods, Whole Foods products on the Amazon site, Amazon Lockers at the Whole Foods stores. So, there’ll be a lot of integration, a lot of touch points and a lot of working together as we go forward. And we think we’ll be also developing new store formats and everything else just as we talked about in the past before Whole Foods: Amazon Books stores, Amazon Go, and the opportunity that that technology presents.  We have on-campus bookstores.So, we are experimenting with a lot of formats. I think that Whole Foods really gives us a, you know, vast head start on that and a great base. And a great team to work with who has a lot of history and a lot of—they probably have 10 to 20 years of learning that we don’t have and wouldn’t have. So, we’re really excited about that and I think working together, will bring our different strengths to the table and really be able to build on behalf of customers.It was obvious from the day Amazon completed its acquisition of Whole Foods in August that the company had big plans. Amazon slashed prices on organic avocados and rotisserie chicken and placed displays of “farm fresh” Amazon Echos, its personal voice-controlled assistant, at the front of stores. Around some Whole Foods locations, it began installing Amazon Lockers, large orange lockers where Amazon customers can pick up online orders and drop off returns.What Olsavsky described goes beyond cheap avocados or using Whole Foods for shipping and distribution. The company envisions nothing less than using the Whole Foods infrastructure to build itself into the real, physical lives of everyday Americans.Amazon of course is already ubiquitous—an estimated two-third of US households subscribe to its Prime membership program. But aside from the packages that come to your door and a few forays into hardware (Kindle, Amazon Echo, Amazon Dash buttons, the failed Fire Phone), the company has little in the way of a physical presence.Why does that matter? Even in our digital heyday of on-demand-anything, the brick-and-mortar store remains a valuable asset. Just look at Apple, which has 498 retail stores worldwide, 271 of them in the US. Apple uses those stores to sell its high-end hardware—the new iPhone X starts at $999—as well as to hold marketing events and “promote brand awareness,” per its 2016 annual report. You can order an iPhone online, sure, but you can see, touch, and admire it in a physical store. Apple stores are a temple to Apple products, visited by more than 1 million people per day. Apple is the world’s most valuable company, with a market capitalization that exceeds $800 billion.Amazon wants that too. “We think the bookstores, for instance, are a really great way for customers to engage with our devices and see them, touch them, play with them and become fans,” Olsavsky told analysts on an earnings call in January, after Amazon announced its full 2016 results. “So we see a lot of value in that as well.” Of course, it takes time and money to build a network of stores akin to Apple’s, which is why Amazon did the next best thing: It bought Whole Foods and its roughly 430 upscale stores in a deal that, after the market weighed in approvingly, practically paid for itself.What became clear in yesterday’s earnings call is that Amazon sees Whole Foods as its nexus of brick-and-mortar power. Whole Foods will be where online meets offline for Amazon and its consumers, merging a variety of Amazon fulfillment and delivery operations (Prime Now, AmazonFresh, Amazon Lockers) with in-store customer experiences. Whole Foods will be a testing ground for Amazon’s other experiments in physical retail, be they Amazon Books stores, the mostly automated Amazon Go convenience stores, or something else entirely.In the most recent quarter, Amazon added a new line to its reporting, breaking out revenue from “physical stores” ($1.3 billion) for the first time. It will be a line to watch closely in the future.

Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) posted its third-quarter results Thursday afternoon.The company reported its earnings after the market closed, which saw AMZN shares soar on the e-commerce retailer’s impressive results. Earnings came in at 52 cents per share, which was in line with the year-ago mark.Revenue was a strong point for Amazon, coming in at $43.7 billion, ahead of the $42.19 billion that analysts were calling for, and ahead of the year-ago mark by 34%. One of the most important elements of the period was the acquisition of Whole Foods, which saw the retailer take over a segment of the grocery industry.Prime Day was important for the company as it helped retail growth to increase, especially in international markets, according to the company’s CFO. Amazon Web Services is the strongest segment of the retailer, growing 42% year-over-year and amounting to 11% of the company’s total revenue.The cloud computing unit is also growing at a fast rate for the retailer, surging to $4.6 billion in the period, ahead of the $3.2 billion from a year ago.Amazon predicts that it will rake in between $56 billion and $60.5 billion in sales during its fourth quarter, which marks a growth of between 28% and 38% for the period. The forecast is fueled by the Whole Foods acquisition, as well as a favorable foreign exchange rate.Operating income is slated to be between $300 million and $1.65 billion, compared with $1.3 billion in the year-ago quarter.AMZN shares soared 7.6% after the bell.Article printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2017/10/amazon-com-inc-amzn-4/.©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC

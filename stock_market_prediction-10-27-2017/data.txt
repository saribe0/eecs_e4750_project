As Twitter clumsily attempts to improve transparency amid revelations that it deleted “user data of potentially irreplaceable value” related to the ongoing congressional Russia investigations, further revelations have come to light suggesting that the social-media company, whether intentionally or not, obfuscated that data. With just days to spare before the $13 billion social-media company testifies before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Politico reports that Twitter twice reminded commercial firms to delete all data associated with revised or deleted tweets or closed accounts in 2016.In June and September of 2016, the company reportedly updated its user agreements and privacy policy—in doing so, it reminded firms that when users delete or revise tweets or close accounts, other users who have access to those tweets are contractually obligated to destroy any trace of them, too. If a firm fails to comply with the policy, it could lose access to Twitter’s database. Twitter said the prompts were intended to remind firms of its existing policies regarding user privacy. “It has long been our stance that developers must keep the Twitter content they consume up to date,” a Twitter spokesperson told me. “We’ve clarified our policy at several points, based both on updates to our overall privacy policy and based on feedback from developers about different use cases. For example, ‘reasonable efforts’ can mean something different for tweets printed in a book versus tweets stored in a database. But the intent is the same.”Twitter added that, as part of its “commitment to transparency,” it had posted blog entries explaining the updates, and that “nearly every major social-media platform requires external developers who use their data to follow these kinds of rules,” pointing to policies at Facebook, Google+, Pinterest, Tumblr, and Instagram. But the timing of the reminders has raised concerns that they might have enabled Russian state agents who played a role in 2016 election-related interference to easily cover their tracks. Some private-sector researchers say they warned Twitter that the directives could impact investigations into any campaign intending to sway the election.In addition, they say Twitter has neglected to change its deletion policy in ways that would allow content to be saved for researchers and law enforcement in the future. “If certain aspects of content on Twitter reveals that there has been interference in our elections, especially by foreign actors but also by people in our country, the public has a right to know,” Samuel Woolley, the former director of Oxford University’s Computational Propaganda Research Team, told Politico. “But before the public has the right to know, I think that congressional investigators, third-party researchers, a lot of other people need to have this information. And this effort to obfuscate information that has been deleted or made private is super problematic.”

Back in 2015, privacy campaigners became aware of a new Wi-Fi-connected toy that raised considerable concern. At issue was Hello Barbie, a doll with speech recognition technology that could hold a two-way conversation with a child.Parents and others grew concerned when it became clear that childrenâs conversations would be stored on cloud servers and used in various ways by Mattel, the toy maker. At the time, Forbes reported that the toyâs terms and conditions allowed the sharing of âaudio recordings with third party vendors who assist us with speech recognition.âThis system had the potential to reveal and share a childâs innermost thoughts. And it raised a wide range of ethical questions. For example, what is the appropriate response if a child asks âWhat should I be when I grow up?âThe episode is emblematic of a much bigger question: How should childrenâs interests be represented in the debate about privacy and big data?Today, Gabrielle Berman and Kerry Albright from the UNICEF Office of Research in Florence, Italy, argue that childrenâs rights have been underrepresented in this area. âDue to the potential for severe, long-lasting and differential impacts on children, child rights need to be firmly integrated onto the agendas of global debates about ethics and data science,â they say.Privacy issues are always complex, but they have greater relevance for children than ever before. Data is being collected and processed on a previously unimaginable scale that is growing at a fantastic rate. âThis accumulation implies that more data will be collected on children over their lifetime than ever before,â say Berman and Albright.Clearly, there will be benefits. Health experts hope to use this data to personalize and improve medicine, for example. Others hope to deliver better services tailored more precisely to each personâs needs. The next generation has the most to gain from these benefitsBut there are disadvantages, too. One problem is the persistence of dataâthe information gathered about children and teenagers could be tied to them by third parties throughout their lives.This is being addressed by the âright to be forgotten,â which allows people in Europe to have historical information about them deleted in certain circumstances. Indeed, there are special provisions within European legislation about how this applies to information about children.Another concern is the spread of data beyond the parties who have collected it. Though anonymization techniques often prevent the data from being linked to specific individuals, there are various ways in which data can later be de-anonymized.Then there are the unknown consequences of future data processing techniques. Nobody is sure how the data that is gathered today will be used in the future.For example, social services in countries such as New Zealand and the U.S. already use data gathered about families to identify children who are at risk. Certain educational establishments use data gathered about students to predict how well they will do and to make decisions about their future.It is not at all clear that these applications were apparent when the data was gathered. An important question is whether the actions taken as a result of this data processing are themselves creating undesired outcomes.Finally, there is the issue of informed consent. In Europe, parents of children under 13 must give consent in order for data to be collected. But there is less protection for older children. An important issue is how to present children with the information they need to decide whether to accept terms and conditions, and how this should change as they get older. This is particularly tricky when future uses of the data are unknown.Berman and Albright say there needs to be a significant effort to better represent the interests of children in this debate, particularly when children in some parts of the world are significantly less well protected than others. âIn an era of increasing dependence on data science and big data, the voices of one set of major stakeholdersâthe worldâs children and those who advocate on their behalfâhave been largely absent,â they say.Thatâs troubling, and a good reason to refocus efforts now.

 The autonomous vessels -- called "Saildrones" -- resemble bright red surfboards. Each is fitted with a 20-foot-high carbon fiber sail, and 16 sensors that test variables including carbon dioxide, acidity, currents and water temperature.  The drones, which cruise at a leisurely 3-5 miles per hour, are doing work typically reserved for manned research ships -- but for a small fraction of the cost.  California-based Saildrone, which raised $14 million in funding from impact investors last September, says its drones can be operated for only 5% of the cost of a manned vessel.  "Beyond its significant commercial demand in industries ranging from fishing to government, [Saildrone] is helping directly measure and thus combat the effects of climate change," said Chamath Palihapitiya, founder and CEO of Social Capital, which has invested in Saildrone.   It's not the only company producing ocean drones.  Liquid Robotics, which is owned by Boeing (BA), makes surfboard-like "Wave Gliders" that are propelled by wave and solar power, rather than wind. The smaller vessels have logged over 1.4 million nautical miles.  Saildrones, meanwhile, have logged a more modest 100,000 nautical miles since the company was founded in 2012. This year, the firm has deployed 20 vehicles for clients including the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).  In July, NOAA sent two Saildrones on a six-month mission to the equator to study the weather phenomenon known as El Nino. Two more set sail for the Arctic Ocean to track melting ice and count fish, seals and whales.  Saildrone also works with NASA to calibrate satellites that measure salinity from space, and the U.S. Navy to detect submarines that could be used to smuggle illegal drugs.  "The idea is that a fleet of Saildrones can stay at sea essentially permanently ... and extend a sort of border control," said Saildrone COO Sebastien de Halleux.  The company's ambition is to scale quickly.  "Our goal is to deploy 1,000 Saildrones, and that would give us in real time -- in high resolution -- the pulse of the planet," said de Halleux.

            There have been times in years past that Amazon, Alphabet (read: Google), and Microsoft have had rough patches. Amazon has suffered quarters-long profit droughts. Alphabet has given its investors agita over profligate spending on non-core products.

In 2008, Apple removed FireWire from the MacBook, only to put it back in 2009. In 2009 the iPod Shuffle went buttonless, only to revert to its previous buttony design in 2010. The third-generation iPod, with its row of touch-sensitive controls, was a similar design cul-de-sac.

And yet every so often the company makes a decision that it thinks is right and is ultimately proven to be completely wrong. In 2008, Apple removed FireWire from the MacBook, only to put it back in 2009. In 2009 the iPod Shuffle went buttonless, only to revert to its previous buttony design in 2010. The third-generation iPod, with its row of touch-sensitive controls, was a similar design cul-de-sac. And the most recent example is the Mac Pro, which Apple introduced to fanfare, but ultimately admitted was a mistake.The Scientists Persuading Terrorists to Spill Their Secrets The interviewer wanted him to provide an account of his plan, and to reveal with whom, if anyone, he has been conspiring. But the detainee – we will call him Diola – refused to divulge any information. Instead, he expounded grandiloquently on the evils of the British state for 42 minutes, with little interruption. When the interviewer attempted questions, Diola responded with scornful, finger-jabbing accusations of ignorance, naivety and moral weakness: “You don’t know how corrupt your own government is – and if you don’t care, then a curse upon you.”When the Revolution Came for Amy Cuddy Cuddy became famous in her field for a 2010 study about the effects of “power poses.” The study found that subjects who were directed to stand or sit in certain positions — legs astride, or feet up on a desk — reported stronger “feelings of power” after posing than they did before. Even more compelling than that, to many of her peers, was that the research measured actual physiological change as a result of the poses: The subjects’ testosterone levels went up, and their cortisol levels, which are associated with stress, went down.They’re saying it looks like a Pokemon monster, but Sinosauropteryx was a real dinosaur with feathers and the “bandit mask” shading of a raccoon or badger, researchers studying its 120-million-year-old fossils say.

THE MORNING PLUM:When Virginia voters go to the polls to choose a new governor in less than two weeks, President Trump’s bigotry and race-bating will be very much on the ballot.Yesterday, Trump himself willed this to be so. The president tweeted that electing Republican Ed Gillespie might “save our great statues” and “heritage.” As an explosion of tweets immediately asked, what heritage, exactly — racism? Whatever Trump meant, there’s no denying that the Virginia contest has become a referendum on how successful Trumpist racial politics will be, now that he’s in the White House.Trump has repeatedly cast Democrat Ralph Northam as soft on immigration and crime, and Gillespie has heavily trafficked in these same attacks, with dishonest ads featuring scary, tattooed, brown-skinned gang members. In the state that was recently the site of white supremacist violence and murder, Gillespie has said Confederate statues should remain. All this is designed to energize Virginia Trump voters.I’ve got some fresh data from a new Wason Center for Public Policy poll that sheds light on whether this effort by Gillespie is working, and how.The poll’s toplines find that Northam leads Gillespie among likely voters, 50 percent to 43 percent. And Rachel Bitecofer, the assistant director of the Wason Center poll, provided me with additional data from the crosstabs.First, the data shows the strategy may be working in one sense: It may be driving up energy among Republicans. In September, the Wason Center poll found that only 72 percent of Republicans were likely to vote, vs. 77 percent of Democrats. But in the latest poll, 79 percent of Republicans are likely to vote, vs. 80 percent of Democrats — meaning Gillespie has reached parity by this metric.“The whole point of Gillespie’s strategy is to get base GOP voters excited by throwing them red meat, and there is some evidence that Republican voters have become more interested in the election,” Bitecofer told me.However, there is also evidence that this strategy may not be doing enough. For one thing, Bitecofer says, right now the enthusiasm gap still favors Democrats. This poll seeks to impose a tight voter screen, based on whether people voted repeatedly in recent elections and are thinking about this one. This matters, because it helps tell us whether turnout will drop off for Democrats in this off-year election or instead will be energized because of Trump — and whether Republican voters will be energized (or not) in the Trump era.The new Wason Center poll suggests that Democrats may be energized. With this screen, it projects an electorate that is 36 percent Democratic, 33 percent Republican and 30 percent independent, Bitecofer tells me. (The 2013 gubernatorial race, which Democrats won, had a very similar electorate.) Another key question is whether nonwhites will be energized. The poll finds that 78 percent of whites are likely to vote, while 76 percent of nonwhites are — no difference. And while 39 percent of whites are thinking about the election a lot, 49 percent of nonwhites are thinking a lot about it.What’s more, Gillespie is winning only 83 percent of self-described strong conservatives, while 93 percent of strong liberals say they’re going for Northam. “That’s bad news for Gillespie,” says Bitecofer, who also wrote a new book on the 2016 campaign.Here’s another data point: While the new poll shows Gillespie trouncing Northam, 64-22, among non-college whites, he is barely ahead of Northam among college-educated whites, at 47-44. Gillespie almost certainly has to run up a larger margin among those voters to win, and this suggests the emphasis on immigration, crime and Confederate statues either isn’t winning enough of those white voters or potentially is alienating them.This could be a key tell. As Ron Brownstein has reported, pollsters on both campaigns see the college-educated white vote as a window into the broader viability of Trumpist campaign appeals. One question for both sides is what impact the racially freighted attacks — which both assume are energizing non-college whites — will have on more educated white suburban and swing voters. Northam’s pollster says the attacks are alienating them. Gillespie’s pollster says the attacks are actually persuading them. Wason Center’s polling supports the former view.The stakes around these matters are very high. Remember, the above represents only one poll, and the polling averages have the race closer, with Northam leading by around 4 points. Gillespie could certainly win. If he does, Republican candidates around the country may be emboldened to amp up the Trumpist tactics — the racial provocation and deliberate stoking of divisions. If Northam wins, Republicans may begin to wonder whether going full Trumpist carries too many costs, in the form of driving away college-educated and suburban whites, and energizing minorities.* REPUBLICANS LOOKING TO WIND DOWN RUSSIA PROBES: Politico reports that congressional Democrats involved in the Russia probes expect that Republicans will likely wind them down before a definitive conclusion is reached on whether collusion occurred:Democrats … seem increasingly resigned to the fact that their probes may end without a conclusion on whether any Americans aided the Russian interference effort. “It’s quite possible that six months from now, there will be unanswered questions that we can’t answer because the people we would need to answer those questions are in Russia,” said Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.). “The probability that we’re going to produce a report that buttons down every question is pretty low.”Weird. Why wouldn’t Republicans want to take the time to flesh out the full story of this effort to sabotage our democracy?* DEEP GOP DIVISIONS REMAIN ON TAXES: The Post takes stock of just how deep the divisions run right now over tax “reform”:Still unresolved were several questions: whether the legislation would moderate the expected benefits for the wealthy … There are deep divisions over which taxes or deductions to eliminate to offset some of the trillions of dollars in revenue lost to proposed steep tax cuts for corporations and some individuals. Options to raise revenue have been met with stiff resistance.Spoiler alert: The most likely outcome is that they will end up slightly moderating the benefits for the wealthy while doing little to offset the lost revenue — and dissembling madly about both.* ANOTHER BIG STAND FROM CORKER AND FLAKE? CNN reports that Sens. Bob Corker and Jeff Flake, who just earned plaudits for calling out Trump as unfit, could also pose an obstacle on tax cuts:Corker has said he won’t vote for anything that adds “one penny” to the deficit and Sen. Jeff Flake … told CNN that he too wasn’t going to vote for just any tax bill if he thought it was fiscally irresponsible. There will be dozens more battles in upcoming weeks after the real details emerge.We’re skeptical. It’s one thing to call out the president of your party for being unfit to serve and a menace to the world. It’s a far taller order to jeopardize your party’s push for tax cuts.* THE BOGUS ARGUMENT FOR TRUMP’S TAX CUTS: Paul Krugman goes right at the heart of the argument that Republicans make for corporate tax cuts, i.e., that their benefits will flow to workers:Realistically … the benefits from cutting corporate taxes would overwhelmingly flow into after-tax profits rather than wages … And this in turn means that the main beneficiaries would be stockholders, not workers. … We’re talking mainly about the very affluent. Even if we count indirect holdings in retirement accounts and mutual funds, the richest 10 percent of U.S. residents account for about 80 percent of American-owned stocks, and the richest 1 percent own about 40 percent.Fortunately, polls suggest that most Americans understand who would really benefit. Unfortunately, Republicans don’t care what most Americans think.* PRESSURE MAY MOUNT ON REPUBLICANS OVER TRUMP: Michael Gerson says his fellow Republicans have a duty to speak up about the president:Conscience does not permit the normalization of deception, spite and bigotry. … When congressional leaders try to ignore Trump’s instability and prejudice in order to pass tax reform, they are living within a lie. … When called upon by events — such as the Charlottesville controversy — to speak the truth, a public official has a duty to do so. And future developments — the culmination of Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation, a serious primary challenge to Trump — may force this soon enough.Indeed, this is likely to get worse for Republicans — possibly a lot worse.* AND TRUMP DRAWS ATTENTION TO IMPEACHMENT DRIVE: Good morning, Mr. President:Wacky & totally unhinged Tom Steyer, who has been fighting me and my Make America Great Again agenda from beginning, never wins elections!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 27, 2017Steyer is funding a $10 million ad campaign calling for Trump’s impeachment.

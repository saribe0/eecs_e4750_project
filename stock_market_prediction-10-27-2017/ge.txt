General Electric (GE) is having a tough time reassuring Wall Street that its turnaround strategy will be successful. The company received a pair of downgrades earlier this week, prompting the stock to close at its lowest level in four and a half years—and shares haven’t recovered since. The stock’s losses were further exacerbated following reports that the company is looking to spinoff parts of its business.  The two downgrades were issued by UBS and Morgan Stanley. UBS lowered its rating on the stock to neutral from buy with a price target of $24 a share, while Morgan Stanley cut its rating from equalweight to underweight and lowered its price target to $22.  In a note to clients, Morgan Stanley analyst Nigel Coe wrote that the challenges CEO John Flannery faces are “greater than even we had imagined,” and the team now believes GE’s “dividend will have to be adjusted down to reflect substantially lower earnings power.” The firm recommends GE reduce its dividend from $0.96 to closer to $0.70, which would be a 37% cut.Although General Electric is by far the biggest loser in the Dow so far this year, a sell rating on GE isn’t too common, and that’s why Morgan Stanley’s bearish call caught some investors by surprise. The stock has erased more than $94 billion from its market cap in 2017 and is down about 34% since the start of the year. Now the question is if CEO John Flannery, whom Morgan Stanley interestingly called “the right man for the mission on hand” when downgrading GE, will spin off a portion of the company’s business. According to the Wall Street Journal, GE’s considering breaking off its railroad business, while Reuters reports that it’s exploring a sale of its transportation and health care information technology businesses. If GE does decide to divest one or both of these divisions, it will help the company get closer to its effort to exit more than $20 billion of assets over the next two years, a move highlighted by Flannery during GE’s earnings call October 20.General Electric was last trading down 2.2% at $20.86 on Friday.

General Electric is looking to cut costs, possibly by selling assets. GE Transportation, based in Erie for most of its 100-year-life, might be one of those assets.The story of century-old GE Transportation has included some dramatic plot twists in recent years.In the past five years alone, the company built its first North American locomotive plant outside of Erie and moved the headquarters of GE Transportation from Erie to Chicago.Now, John Flannery, the newly installed CEO of Boston-based General Electric Co., is said to be considering a move that could mark the final chapter in the history of the GE locomotive business that helped form the core of the original General Electric.The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Flannery is said to be looking "to partner, spin off or possibly sell the operations."The company, which eliminated 1,500 jobs at its Erie plant in 2015 and has plans to cut another 570 in 2018, has incentives to part with some of its assets.GE, which announced third-quarter earnings on Friday, fell far short of quarterly earnings projections, prompting the company to cut its dividends as its stock price, off more than 30 percent this year, continues to lose ground.Flannery, who is expected to offer a blueprint in November of how he plans to cut costs, is looking to divest itself of $20 billion in assets in the next two years.There was no comment from the company on Thursday."We don't comment on rumors or speculation," said Deia Campanelli, a spokeswoman for GE Transportation.Scott Slawson, president of Local 506 of the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America at GE Transportation, said he thought the story might have grown out of an idle comment from an analyst."I am not going to worry about what may or may not happen, whether we are going to merge, whether we are going to be spun off or sold," he said. "If it happens, we will deal with it then. If it doesn't happen, then yay for us."According to the Journal's report, Flannery said the company has a number of "businesses which drain investment and management resources without the prospects for a substantial reward."While that statement alone doesn't necessarily point to GE Transportation, the newspaper cites unidentified sources said to be familiar with the matter who indicate GE Transportation is being eyed for possible sale.In terms of its impact on the company's bottom line, GE Transportation is a relatively small player.GE Transportation returned a profit of $276 million in the third quarter, just a fraction of the $1.6 billion earned by GE Aviation or a little less than a third of the earnings generated by GE Healthcare.On the other hand, despite a dramatic sales slowdown over the past two years, GE Transportation's profit margin for the third quarter was 25.7 percent, the highest of any GE business.Barbara Chaffee, who has followed GE Transportation closely during the past six years as CEO of the Erie Regional Chamber and Growth Partnership, isn't ready to dismiss reports of a possible sale or merger."Flannery said he was going to cut $2 billion (in spending) and I think he's taking that seriously," she said.But her reaction to the potential change is hardly matter-of-fact."When Erie and GE locomotive have such a deep history, it kind of shakes you to the core," she said. "We know we are seeing great shifts, but it's hard to reconcile."Chaffee, who will step down from her position at THE chamber next week, said the potential of a GE sale is a reminder of the need to develop homegrown companies that are rooted in the community.Like Slawson, she hopes GE Transportation holds onto the locomotive business founded by Thomas Edison.But Chaffee is keenly aware that there's little room for nostalgia in the corporate world, especially at a company trying hard to find solid footing."For a large corporation, the reality is that their first priority has to be their shareholders," Chaffee said. "I certainly understand that they don't have the kind of relationship with the community that we have with them."Jim Martin can be reached at 870-1668 or by email.

“This is one of the first large extensions of a cloud-architected analytics platform in the utility industry.”GE inks an important deal for its grid analytics software.
	GE’s companywide earnings fell short of expectations last week, but its digital grid business keeps on growing.
	Descended from Thomas Edison’s electrical appliance enterprise, GE still has its fingers in a nearly unfathomable number of pies. It continues to lead in conventional power applications, like wind turbines and gas generators, but it’s also been building out Predix, an industrial internet-of-things business that pairs on-the-ground sensors with local and cloud computing.
	In Q3 2017, GE Digital orders grew 50 percent year over year, the company said. In previous quarters, power was the fastest-growing segment within the digital category.
	That momentum continued this week thanks to a new partnership with Exelon, one of the biggest power providers in the U.S. and a flagship customer for GE Digital. In a separate deal, the New York Power Authority will expand its use of GE software and analytics as well.
	Exelon had already adopted Predix across its fleet of competitive generators, which includes the largest nuclear capacity in the U.S. Now, the company is rolling out the industrial internet service to its portfolio of six regulated wires utilities, it announced at GE’s Minds and Machines conference Wednesday.
	The goal is to work with GE to improve the cost-effectiveness of electrical distribution and prepare for regulatory grid overhauls coming to Exelon’s various markets.
	"What we want to do is use the analytics to allow us to be prepared to pivot and support any of the models that may come up," said Brian Hurst, VP and chief analytics officer for Exelon Utilities.
	The expansion marks an evolution from the initial Predix application of monitoring the health of discrete generating assets, said Ben Kellison, director of grid research at GTM Research. 
	"This is one of the first large extensions of a cloud-architected analytics platform in the utility industry, and it’s a strong endorsement from one of the largest companies in the space that there’s value to be had from investing in digitization that crosses functional and business-unit boundaries, in this case generation, transmission and distribution."
	A smarter way to keep the lights on

GE Shares Tumble as Analysts Slash Price TargetsFor much of the past century, General Electric Co.—whose history stretches back to Thomas Edison’s lightbulb—had been a symbol of the by-the-numbers management credo that ruled American business before the digital age. But GE’s eyesore of an earnings report on Oct. 20 leaves little doubt that the 125-year-old company, with a market value of $186 billion, is facing a financial and cultural senior moment.This icon of American industry has been forced to cut its earnings and cash flow outlook so drastically that investors are now preparing for a once-unthinkable cut to its dividend. A rapid-fire series of high-level departures over the past few months, beginning with longtime Chief Executive Officer Jeff Immelt, represents a jarring transition for the company. There’s even speculation that GE, the only member of the original Dow Jones industrial average still on the benchmark, could get dropped from the list.“There was a long stretch where GE was viewed as a management leader,” says Scott Lawson, a vice president at Westwood Holdings Group Inc., which oversees more than $20 billion in assets. “Sometimes the memories last much longer than the reality.”GE’s shares have fallen 32 percent in 2017, their worst year-to-date performance since the financial crisis. But there’s no market crash to blame this time. Instead, some analysts say much of the cause lies with management’s poor capital-allocation decisions and GE’s cultural shortcomings—and those are actually harder problems to fix.GE cut its 2017 earnings guidance to $1.05 to $1.10 a share—far below an initial forecast of $1.60 to $1.70. Likewise, its target for cash flow from industrial operating activities was cut almost in half, to $7 billion. New CEO John Flannery’s frankness about GE’s failures is a refreshing change to many investors. But it’s a sign of how much work needs to be done that things had to get this dire for management to have an honest discussion about cash flow and earnings challenges that analysts have highlighted since at least 2016.Flannery is set to reveal his turnaround plan for GE when he meets with investors on Nov. 13. Many of the specifics thus far are of the symbolic variety: grounding private planes, pledging to get rid of confusing earnings adjustments, and putting a representative from activist investor Trian Fund Management LP on the board. Those tweaks and even the $20 billion in divestitures Flannery says he’s considering will do little to stanch the bad operating results that will persist at least through next year.One change that could make a difference—though a challenge to GE’s very DNA—is a reduction in its dividend. The company was forced to cut the payout during the Great Depression and again during the financial crisis. The latter instance was dubbed by Immelt as “the worst day of my tenure as CEO.” Now Flannery may have little choice but to do so again.After capital expenditure and pension commitments, GE will have only about $2 billion of free cash flow from its industrial businesses this year. The dividend costs more than $8 billion. It doesn’t take a mathematician to see that’s a problem. GE does have cash on its balance sheet that it can use to plug this year’s gap. But Vertical Research Partners analyst Jeff Sprague estimates free cash flow from its industrial businesses will again fall short of what’s needed to cover the dividend in 2018, given the struggles in GE’s power unit.GE has already lavished almost $50 billion on investors via share buybacks in the past few years. And directing proceeds from additional borrowing to the dividend rather than investments that might actually help its businesses generate stronger cash flow would be unwise. Without a dividend cut, Flannery’s plan to divest $20 billion of assets would likely be just another stopgap that would actually exacerbate the cash crunch by reducing free cash flow.That would be a continuation of a pattern that helped create GE’s predicament. Under Immelt’s watch, the company unwound GE Capital, put its appliances, water, and industrial-solutions units up for sale, and divested its stake in NBCUniversal. While there’s nothing wrong with simplification, JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst Steve Tusa has estimated those divestitures reduced free cash flow by about $7.2 billion. Acquisitions such as the $10.6 billion purchase of Alstom SA’s power assets in 2015 don’t generate enough cash to make up for that. So GE’s resources have gotten smaller, but its dividend hasn’t.Beyond dismantling the private-plane excesses of Immelt’s tenure, Flannery may need to consider tackling his own legacy, too. He’s a 30-year GE veteran whose contributions include the Alstom acquisition—a purchase that increased GE’s exposure to power markets now being roiled by sluggish demand and pricing pressure. About $3 billion of the drop in GE’s 2017 expected cash flow is attributable to the power unit.JPMorgan’s Tusa has argued that the challenges facing the power division aren’t a blip but rather the start of a slide to a new normal of lower profitability. If that’s the case, perhaps the dividend isn’t the only legacy Flannery may have to change. Sutherland is a writer for Bloomberg Gadfly.

To receive further updates on this Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT) trade, sign up for a risk-free trial of Maximum Options today.A bearish opportunity I see in today’s market involves Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT). Wal-Mart seems to be trying to fight back against Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), but that’s difficult to do. Personally, I tried to buy something online from Wal-Mart, and it was very complicated compared to Amazon, which was almost automatic. And, like many people, I’m not going to spend a lot of time trying to do something when I don’t have to. It’s just a lot easier to work with Amazon than with Wal-Mart at this point.What’s more, WMT has a tendency to drop right at the beginning of the year. If you look at the chart, year after year that January drop usually occurs. Also, WMT really has had a huge gain this year, and I thought that it probably overdid it.With all that in mind, here is my recommendation for a put debit spread on WMT:Using a spread order, buy to open the WMT Jan. 19th $82.50 put and sell to open the WMT Jan. 19th $77.50 put for a net debit of about $0.90 to $0.95.Note: There are several January expirations available for WMT options. Be sure you are opening the monthly options that expire on Friday, Jan. 19, 2018.A debit spread is simply a way to lower the cost of buying options, as the option that you sell to open (short) helps offset the cost of the option that you buy to open. Therefore, this put debit spread is a way to lower the cost of buying bearish put options. Many brokers will require the use of margin and/or a set amount of reserved capital to execute a debit spread; contact your broker directly for specific requirements.Ken Trester is editor of the popular Maximum Options program. Trester has been trading options since the first exchanges opened in 1973 with a winning streak that goes back to 1984 with money-doubling average annual profits since 1990.Article printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2017/10/trade-day-wal-mart-stores-inc-wmt/.©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC

(NYSE:WMT) and Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) are the two most active stocks in the Discount, Variety Stores industry based on today’s trading volumes. Investor interest in the two stocks is clearly very high, but which is the better investment? To answer this question, we will compare the two companies across growth, profitability, risk, and valuation metrics, and also examine their analyst ratings and insider activity trends.GrowthCompanies that can increase earnings at a high compound rate over time are attractive to investors. Analysts expect WMT to grow earnings at a 6.66% annual rate over the next 5 years. Comparatively, TGT is expected to grow at a -3.33% annual rate. All else equal, WMT’s higher growth rate would imply a greater potential for capital appreciation.
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
Profitability and ReturnsGrowth doesn’t mean much if it comes at the cost of weak profitability. To adjust for differences in capital structure we’ll use EBITDA margin and Return on Investment (ROI) as measures of profitability and return. , compared to an EBITDA margin of 10.11% for Target Corporation (TGT). WMT’s ROI is 13.40% while TGT has a ROI of 15.50%. The interpretation is that TGT’s business generates a higher return on investment than WMT’s.Cash Flow 
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
The amount of free cash flow available to investors is ultimately what determines the value of a stock. WMT’s free cash flow (“FCF”) per share for the trailing twelve months was +0.66. Comparatively, TGT’s free cash flow per share was +1.04. On a percent-of-sales basis, WMT’s free cash flow was 0.41% while TGT converted 0.82% of its revenues into cash flow. This means that, for a given level of sales, TGT is able to generate more free cash flow for investors.Liquidity and Financial RiskBalance sheet risk is one of the biggest factors to consider before investing. WMT has a current ratio of 0.80 compared to 0.90 for TGT. This means that TGT can more easily cover its most immediate liabilities over the next twelve months. WMT’s debt-to-equity ratio is 0.62 versus a D/E of 1.10 for TGT. TGT is therefore the more solvent of the two companies, and has lower financial risk.ValuationWMT trades at a forward P/E of 19.16, a P/B of 3.49, and a P/S of 0.53, compared to a forward P/E of 14.21, a P/B of 3.10, and a P/S of 0.49 for TGT. WMT is the expensive of the two stocks on an earnings, book value and sales basis. Given that earnings are what matter most to investors, analysts tend to place a greater weight on the P/E.Analyst Price Targets and OpinionsInvestors often compare a stock’s current price to an analyst price target to get a sense of the potential upside within the next year. WMT is currently priced at a 1.97% to its one-year price target of 86.94. Comparatively, TGT is 5.57% relative to its price target of 59.28. This suggests that WMT is the better investment over the next year.The average investment recommendation on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell) is 2.40 for WMT and 3.00 for TGT, which implies that analysts are more bullish on the outlook for TGT.Risk and VolatilityTo gauge the market risk of a particular stock, investors use beta. Stocks with a beta above 1 are more volatile than the market as a whole. Conversely, a beta below 1 implies below average systematic risk. WMT has a beta of 0.33 and TGT’s beta is 0.63. WMT’s shares are therefore the less volatile of the two stocks.Insider Activity and Investor SentimentShort interest is another tool that analysts use to gauge investor sentiment. It represents the percentage of a stock’s tradable shares that are being shorted. WMT has a short ratio of 5.03 compared to a short interest of 8.63 for TGT. This implies that the market is currently less bearish on the outlook for WMT.SummaryTarget Corporation (NYSE:TGT) beats Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.
